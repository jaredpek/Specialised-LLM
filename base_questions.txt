What does the 's' character in '-rwsr-xr-x' represent in file permissions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT [1911]:
I am using the command line utility "chmod" to modify the permissions of a file in my Linux system. I noticed that the command includes a character's' at the end of the permission string. I am curious to know what this character represents.

I have tried searching online, but I couldn't find a clear answer. I have also tried experimenting with different combinations of characters in the permission string, but I still don't understand the purpose of the's' character.

Any insights or explanations would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Reply 1:

The's' character in the permission string represents the "setuid" permission. This permission allows the user who is executing the command to change the permissions of the file.

Reply 2:

The's' character in the permission string represents the "setgid" permission. This permission allows the group who is executing the command to change the permissions of the file.

Reply 3:

The's' character in the permission string represents the "setx" permission. This permission allows the user who is executing the command to change the permissions of the file, but not the group or other users.

Reply 4:

The's' character in the permission string represents the "setxg" permission. This permission allows the group who is executing the command to change the permissions of the file, but not the user or other groups.

Reply 5:

The's' character in the permission string represents the "setx" permission, which is a shorthand notation for "setx -rw-r--r--". This permission allows the user who is executing the command to change the permissions of the file, but not the group or other users.

To tie this back to the original question, the's' character in the permission string is used to modify the permissions of a file in Linux. It allows the user who is executing the command to change the permissions of the file, but not the group or other users.
