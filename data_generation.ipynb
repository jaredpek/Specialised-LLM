    "# Synthetic Data Generation for LLM Fine-Tuning (Gemini 2.5 Flash with PDF Chunks)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a two-stage workflow for generating synthetic data. First, it preprocesses large PDF files from a `raw_data` directory by splitting them into smaller chunks and copying the original file into a `chunked_data` directory. Second, it iterates through all files in `chunked_data` (both chunks and full files), uploading each one to the `gemini-2.5-flash` model to generate synthetic input-output pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "1.  **Setup**: Install and import necessary libraries.\n",
    "2.  **Environment Configuration**: Load your Gemini API key from environment variables.\n",
    "3.  **API and Path Configuration**: Configure directories, the Gemini client, and model parameters.\n",
    "4.  **Preprocessing**: A dedicated function splits source PDFs and copies the original files into the `chunked_data` directory.\n",
    "5.  **Data Generation**: The script iterates through the pre-made PDF chunks and the full PDFs, generating a consistent number of pairs for each.\n",
    "6.  **Save Output**: All generated data is grouped by the original source file and saved to CSV files in the `generated_data` directory."

An attacker manipulates the input to alter the intended SQL command. \\n\\nFor example, consider a query `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name = '$name'`. If a user provides `$name = 'Bob'`, the query executes normally. However, if an attacker sets `$name = '' OR 1=1 --`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --`. Since `1=1` is always true, the `WHERE` clause evaluates to true for all rows, effectively selecting the entire table. \\n\\nAnother attack involves injecting commands. If an attacker sets `$name = '; DROP TABLE Accounts --`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name = ''; DROP TABLE Accounts --`. This injects a second, malicious SQL statement that deletes the entire `Accounts` table.\"\n",

This type of attack is persistent and affects all users who view the compromised content.\\n2.  **Reflected XSS (Non-persistent):** This attack involves the attacker tricking a victim into clicking a malicious link or submitting a form that contains the malicious script.

    "## Key Instructions\n",
    "1.  **Instruction (`input`):** Create a clear and specific prompt a user would ask. Vary the tasks: include direct questions, summarization requests, comparisons between concepts, and analytical prompts that require reasoning. Ensure a range of complexity.\n",
    "2.  **Response (`output`):** Write a detailed, accurate, and direct answer as if you are an expert on the subject. The response must fully and exclusively satisfy the user's instruction.\n",
    "3.  **Source Grounding:** Base all responses **exclusively** on the information within the provided document.\n",
    "4.  **No Self-Reference:** Do not mention the source document in your responses. Avoid any phrases like \"According to the document...\" or \"The provided text states...\".\n",

    "## Formatting Requirements\n",
    "* Your entire output **must** be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON structure.\n",
    "* **CRITICAL:** All strings within the JSON must be properly escaped to ensure the output is parsable.\n",
    "    * All backslashes (`\\`) must be escaped as (`\\\\`). For example, the text `\\x48` must be written in the JSON string as `\\\\x48`, and `\\n` must be written as `\\\\n`.\n",
    "    * All newlines (`\\n`) must be escaped as (`\\\\n`). For example, the text `hi\\n` must be written in the JSON string as `hi\\\\n`.\n",
    "    * All double quotes (`\"`) must be escaped as (`\\\"`). For example, the text `he said \"hello\"` must be written as `he said \\\"hello\\\"` and `\"` must be written as `\\\"`.\n",
    "    * Do not escape any other characters as those are invalid characters. For example, the text `this 'item'` must be written as `this 'item'` and `printf(\"%d\\n\", 5);` must be written as `printf(\\\"%d\\\\n\\\", 5);`.\n",
