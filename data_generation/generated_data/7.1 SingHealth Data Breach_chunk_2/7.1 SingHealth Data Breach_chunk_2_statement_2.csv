This deficiency impacted their ability to appreciate the security implications of their findings and to respond effectively to the attack."
Define 'phishing attacks' as used in the context of the initial access.,"Phishing attacks are a method used by attackers to gain initial access to systems. In this context, it refers to a technique where attackers likely tricked individuals into compromising front-end workstations, leading to the breach of the SingHealth IT network."
Explain the concept of 'lateral movement' by the attacker.,"Lateral movement refers to the actions taken by an attacker after gaining initial access to a network to move from one compromised system to another. In this case, the attacker engaged in lateral movement for six months, compromising endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database."
What are 'endpoints' and 'servers' in the context of network compromise?,"Endpoints are individual devices connected to a network, such as workstations and laptops. Servers are powerful computers that provide services and manage resources for other devices on the network. The attacker compromised many of these in the SingHealth network."
What is the significance of the 'Citrix servers' in the breach?,"The Citrix servers located in SGH were significant because they were connected to the SCM database. The attacker compromised these servers as part of their lateral movement, which ultimately allowed them to access the SCM database."
What is the 'SCM database' and why was it targeted?,The SCM database is a database that was connected to the compromised Citrix servers. The attacker targeted this database to steal and exfiltrate patient records.
Define 'user accounts' and 'administrator accounts' in the context of the breach.,"User accounts are credentials used by individuals to access network resources. Administrator accounts have elevated privileges, allowing for greater control over systems and data. The attacker compromised a large number of both types of accounts."
What are 'virtual machines' and how were they used by the attacker?,"Virtual machines (VMs) are software-based emulations of computer systems. The attacker used suspected virtual machines, along with compromised user workstations, to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers starting in May 2018."
Explain 'unauthorised logins' and 'failed attempts' as detected by IT administrators.,"Unauthorized logins refer to attempts to access systems using credentials that do not belong to the individual attempting the login. Failed attempts indicate that the login process was unsuccessful, often due to incorrect credentials or security measures. IHIS' IT administrators detected such activities on Citrix servers and attempts to access the SCM DB."
What does it mean to 'query' a database?,"To query a database means to request information from it. On June 27, 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database, which involved accessing and retrieving patient records."
Define 'stealing' and 'exfiltrating' patient records.,"Stealing patient records refers to the unauthorized taking of this sensitive data. Exfiltrating patient records means transferring this stolen data out of the secure network to an external location. The attacker performed both actions on June 27, 2018."
What does it mean to be 'undetected' by IHiS?,"Being undetected by IHiS means that the attacker's malicious activities, such as querying and exfiltrating patient records, were not identified or noticed by the IHiS security systems or personnel at the time they were occurring."
What are 'suspicious queries' on a database?,"Suspicious queries are database requests that deviate from normal patterns or appear unusual, potentially indicating unauthorized access or malicious intent. An IHiS administrator noticed such queries on the SCM database on July 4, 2018."
Explain the 'termination' of ongoing suspicious queries.,The termination of ongoing suspicious queries means that the unauthorized database requests were stopped. This was done by IT administrators working together to halt the attacker's access and activity.
What are 'measures' put in place to prevent further queries?,"Measures are actions or security controls implemented to block or deter further unauthorized access. In this case, after terminating suspicious queries, specific measures were put in place to prevent the attacker from querying the SCM database again."
What does 'recurrence of the attack' mean in this context?,Recurrence of the attack refers to the possibility of the attacker launching similar or repeated malicious activities. The implemented measures aimed to prevent such a recurrence.
Define 'internet surfing separation'.,"Internet surfing separation is a security measure that restricts or prevents users from accessing the internet. For SingHealth, this was implemented on July 20, 2018, to further secure the network in response to observed malicious activities."
What is the significance of 'no further suspicious activity was detected'?,"This statement indicates that after July 20, 2018, no unusual or potentially malicious actions were identified within the SingHealth network. This suggests that the implemented security measures were effective in stopping the attacker's activities."
