What are the differences between phishing attacks and lateral movement in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach?,"Phishing attacks were the likely method through which the attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17, infecting front-end workstations. Lateral movement, on the other hand, refers to the attacker's actions after gaining initial access. The attacker lay dormant for 4 months before commencing lateral movement for 6 months between Dec2017 and Jun2018, during which they compromised many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database."
Describe the timeline of the attacker's initial access and subsequent actions in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17, likely through phishing attacks that infected front-end workstations. Following this, the attacker remained dormant for 4 months. Subsequently, from December 2017 to June 2018 (a period of 6 months), the attacker engaged in lateral movement within the network, compromising numerous endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database. During this phase, a large number of user and administrator accounts were also compromised."
"What is meant by 'lateral movement' in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach, and when did it occur?","Lateral movement, in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach, refers to the attacker's actions to move within the compromised network after gaining initial access. This involved compromising various endpoints and servers. The attacker commenced lateral movement for a period of 6 months, specifically between December 2017 and June 2018. This movement led to the compromise of many endpoints and servers, including the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database."
Explain the role of Citrix servers and the SCM database in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"The Citrix servers, located in SGH, played a crucial role in the SingHealth cyber breach as they were connected to the SCM database. During the lateral movement phase, which occurred between December 2017 and June 2018, the attacker compromised these Citrix servers. Subsequently, on June 11, 2018, IT administrators noticed unauthorized logins to the Citrix servers and failed attempts to access the SCM database. On June 27, 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database, stealing and exfiltrating patient records."
"When did IT administrators first notice suspicious activity related to the SingHealth cyber breach, and what did they observe?","IHIS' IT administrators first noticed unauthorized logins to Citrix servers and failed attempts at accessing the SCM database on June 11, 2018.
