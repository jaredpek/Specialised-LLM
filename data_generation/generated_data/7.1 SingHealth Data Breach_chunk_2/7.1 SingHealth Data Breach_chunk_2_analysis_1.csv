Analyze the initial access vector of the SingHealth cyber breach with respect to the method of infection.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17. The method of infection was most likely through phishing attacks, which infected front-end workstations."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of the attacker's dormancy period and subsequent actions?,"The attacker lay dormant for 4 months after gaining initial access. Following this period, the attacker commenced lateral movement within the network for 6 months, spanning from December 2017 to June 2018.
