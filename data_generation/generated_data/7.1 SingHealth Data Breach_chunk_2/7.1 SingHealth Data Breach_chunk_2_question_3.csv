"What was the finding regarding IHiS staff's cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources?","It was found that IHiS staff did not have adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This inadequacy prevented them from appreciating the security implications of their findings and responding effectively to the attack."
What is the definition of phishing attacks?,"Phishing attacks are a type of social engineering where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware, often through deceptive emails or messages."
What is meant by 'lateral movement' in the context of a cyberattack?,"Lateral movement in the context of a cyberattack refers to the attacker's actions to move from one compromised system to another within a network, often to gain access to more valuable data or systems."
What are 'endpoints' in a network?,"Endpoints in a network are the devices that connect to the network, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and servers."
What is the significance of Citrix servers being connected to the SCM database?,The connection of Citrix servers to the SCM database meant that compromising these servers provided the attacker with a pathway to access and potentially steal data from the SCM database.
What is the difference between a user account and an administrator account?,"A user account typically has limited privileges and is used for day-to-day operations. An administrator account has elevated privileges, allowing it to manage and control system settings, install software, and access sensitive data."
What are virtual machines?,"Virtual machines (VMs) are software-based emulations of computer systems. They allow a single physical computer to run multiple operating systems and applications independently, appearing as separate machines."

What is the definition of 'stealing' data in a cyberattack context?,"In a cyberattack context, stealing data refers to the unauthorized acquisition or theft of information from a system or database."
What is 'exfiltrating' patient records?,Exfiltrating patient records means the unauthorized transfer of sensitive patient data out of the secure SingHealth network to an external location controlled by the attacker.
What does it mean to be 'undetected' by IHiS?,Being undetected by IHiS means that the attacker's malicious activities were not identified or flagged by IHiS' security systems or personnel at the time they were occurring.
What are 'suspicious queries' in a database context?,"Suspicious queries in a database context are database requests that deviate from normal patterns, may indicate unauthorized access, or suggest an attempt to extract sensitive information."
What does it mean to 'terminate' ongoing suspicious queries?,"To terminate ongoing suspicious queries means to stop or cancel the database requests that are deemed suspicious, preventing further data access or manipulation."
What are 'measures' put in place to prevent further queries?,Measures put in place to prevent further queries are security actions or configurations implemented to block or restrict unauthorized access attempts to the database.
