What are the differences between phishing attacks and lateral movement in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach?,"Phishing attacks were the method through which the attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17, infecting front-end workstations. Lateral movement, on the other hand, refers to the attacker's actions after gaining initial access. The attacker lay dormant for 4 months before commencing lateral movement for 6 months in the network between Dec2017 and Jun2018, compromising many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database. Lateral movement is the process of an attacker moving from one compromised system to another within a network."
Describe the timeline of the attacker's initial access and subsequent actions in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17, likely through phishing attacks that infected front-end workstations. Following this, the attacker remained dormant for 4 months. Subsequently, from December 2017 to June 2018 (a period of 6 months), the attacker engaged in lateral movement within the network, compromising numerous endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers at SGH that were connected to the SCM database. During this phase, a large number of user and administrator accounts were also compromised."
What were the initial methods of attack and the subsequent network activities of the attacker in the SingHealth cyber breach?,"The attacker initially gained access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17 by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. After this initial compromise, the attacker remained inactive for 4 months. Following this dormant period, the attacker began a phase of lateral movement, which lasted for 6 months between December 2017 and June 2018. This lateral movement involved compromising numerous endpoints and servers, including the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. Additionally, during this period, the attacker compromised a significant number of user and administrator accounts."
Explain the role of Citrix servers and the SCM database in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"Citrix servers, specifically those located in SGH, played a crucial role in the SingHealth cyber breach. The attacker compromised these Citrix servers as part of their lateral movement within the network. These Citrix servers were connected to the SCM database. The attacker's ultimate goal was to access and steal patient records from the SCM database, which they began querying on 27 June 2018."
"What is meant by 'lateral movement' in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach, and when did it occur?","Lateral movement, in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach, refers to the attacker's actions of moving from one compromised system to another within the network. After gaining initial access and remaining dormant for 4 months, the attacker commenced lateral movement for a period of 6 months, spanning from December 2017 to June 2018. During this phase, they compromised numerous endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database, and also compromised many user and administrator accounts."
How did the attacker leverage compromised user workstations and virtual machines?,"Starting from May 2018, the attacker utilized compromised user workstations within the SingHealth IT network and suspected virtual machines. These compromised resources were used to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers. This allowed the attacker to further their access and operations within the network."
"When did IT administrators first notice suspicious activity related to the SingHealth cyber breach, and what did they observe?",IHIS' IT administrators first noticed unauthorized logins to Citrix servers and failed attempts at accessing the SCM database on 11 June 2018.
