What are the differences between phishing attacks and lateral movement in the context of the SingHealth cyber breach?,"Phishing attacks were the likely method through which the attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17, infecting front-end workstations. Lateral movement, on the other hand, refers to the attacker's actions after gaining initial access. The attacker lay dormant for 4 months before commencing lateral movement for 6 months between Dec2017 and Jun2018, compromising many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database."
Describe the timeline of the attacker's initial access and subsequent actions in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23/8/17, likely through phishing attacks that infected front-end workstations. Following this, the attacker remained dormant for 4 months. Subsequently, from December 2017 to June 2018 (a period of 6 months), the attacker engaged in lateral movement within the network, compromising numerous endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database. During this phase, a large number of user and administrator accounts were also compromised."
What were the initial entry vector and the subsequent network activities of the attacker in the SingHealth cyber breach?,"The initial entry vector for the attacker into SingHealth's IT network, around 23/8/17, was most likely through phishing attacks that infected front-end workstations. After gaining access, the attacker remained dormant for 4 months. This was followed by a 6-month period of lateral movement, from December 2017 to June 2018, during which the attacker compromised numerous endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers linked to the SCM database. Additionally, a significant number of user and administrator accounts were compromised during this phase."
Explain the role of Citrix servers and the SCM database in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"Citrix servers, located in SGH, were compromised by the attacker during the lateral movement phase, which occurred between December 2017 and June 2018. These Citrix servers were connected to the SCM database. Subsequently, on 27 June 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database, stealing and exfiltrating patient records. This activity went undetected by IHiS initially."
"When did IT administrators first notice suspicious activity related to the SingHealth cyber breach, and what did they observe?","IHIS' IT administrators first noticed unauthorized logins to Citrix servers and failed attempts at accessing the SCM database on 11 June 2018. One week later, on 4 July 2018, an administrator for the SCM system specifically noticed suspicious queries being made on the SCM database."
"Detail the attacker's actions on June 27, 2018, in the SingHealth cyber breach.","On 27 June 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database. This involved stealing and exfiltrating patient records. Importantly, this activity was carried out undetected by IHiS at that time."
What actions were taken by IT administrators after noticing suspicious queries on the SCM database?,"After an IHiS administrator noticed suspicious queries on the SCM database on 4 July 2018, IT administrators worked together to terminate the ongoing suspicious queries. They also implemented measures to prevent further queries to the SCM database. These actions proved successful, as no further successful queries were made by the attacker after 4 July 2018."
Compare the initial detection of unauthorized logins and the detection of suspicious queries in the SingHealth cyber breach.,"Unauthorized logins to Citrix servers and failed attempts at accessing the SCM database were first noticed by IHIS' IT administrators on 11 June 2018.
