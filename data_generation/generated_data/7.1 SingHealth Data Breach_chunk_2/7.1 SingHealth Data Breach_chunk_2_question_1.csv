"What were the consequences of IHiS staff lacking adequate cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources?","Due to the lack of adequate cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources, IHiS staff were unable to appreciate the security implications of their findings and to respond effectively to the attack."
What is a phishing attack?,"A phishing attack is a type of cyberattack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, or to install malware. This is typically done through fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that impersonate legitimate entities."
What is meant by 'lateral movement' in the context of a cyberattack?,"Lateral movement refers to the techniques and actions an attacker takes to navigate through a compromised network after gaining initial access. The goal is to discover and access valuable data or systems, often by exploiting vulnerabilities or using stolen credentials to move from one system to another."
What are 'endpoints' in a network?,"Endpoints in a network are the devices that connect to the network and are used by individuals. This includes computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, servers, and other network-connected devices. They are often the targets or entry points for cyberattacks."
What is a 'virtual machine' in the context of IT infrastructure?,"A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs on a host operating system but functions as an independent computer with its own operating system, applications, and resources. VMs allow for the creation of isolated computing environments."
What is the SCM database?,The SCM database is a database that was connected to the Citrix servers located in SGH. The document indicates that patient records were stored in this database and were targeted by the attacker.
What is the function of Citrix servers in this context?,"Citrix servers, in this context, were part of the SingHealth IT infrastructure and were connected to the SCM database. They were compromised by the attacker and were a point of access for unauthorized logins and attempts to access the SCM DB."
What is the definition of 'unauthorized logins'?,"Unauthorized logins refer to instances where individuals access a system or account without proper permission or authentication. This can occur through stolen credentials, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or other illicit means."
What does it mean to 'exfiltrate patient records'?,"To exfiltrate patient records means to secretly or illicitly transfer sensitive patient data from a secure system or network to an unauthorized location. This is a common objective in data breaches, where attackers steal personal health information for malicious purposes."
What is IHiS?,"IHiS refers to Integrated Health Information Systems, which is an IT organization serving Singapore's public healthcare sector. In the context of the document, IHiS IT administrators were responsible for managing and securing the IT infrastructure, including the Citrix servers and SCM database."
What is the Cyber Security Agency (CSA)?,"The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) is an entity that deals with cybersecurity matters. In this case, the matter of the cyberattack was escalated to the CSA, indicating its role in investigating and responding to significant cyber threats."
What is the Ministry of Health (MOH)?,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) is a government ministry responsible for health policies and services. In this context, SingHealth's senior management, along with other entities, was informed of the cyberattack, highlighting the MOH's oversight in healthcare-related incidents."
What is the Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH)?,"The Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH) is an entity related to the Ministry of Health. It was also notified as part of the escalation process for the cyberattack, indicating its involvement in the broader healthcare system's response."
What is 'remediation' in the context of cybersecurity?,"Remediation in cybersecurity refers to the process of fixing security vulnerabilities and addressing the impact of a security incident. This includes actions taken to restore systems, remove threats, and implement measures to prevent future occurrences."
What does it mean to 'eliminate attacker's footholds'?,Eliminating an attacker's footholds refers to the process of removing all traces and access points that an attacker may have established within a compromised network. This ensures that the attacker cannot regain access or persist in the environment.
What is 'internet surfing separation' as a security measure?,"Internet surfing separation is a security measure designed to isolate a network or specific systems from direct internet access. This is done to prevent malicious activities, such as malware infections or unauthorized access, that can originate from browsing the internet."
What is a 'COI Committee'?,"A COI Committee likely stands for Committee of Inquiry. This committee is formed to investigate incidents, gather facts, and make findings and recommendations. In this case, it investigated the cyberattack and identified key findings."
What are 'key findings' in the context of a committee's investigation?,"Key findings are the most important conclusions or discoveries made by a committee during its investigation. These findings typically highlight the root causes, contributing factors, and significant aspects of the event being studied."
What is 'cybersecurity awareness'?,"Cybersecurity awareness refers to the understanding and knowledge individuals have about cybersecurity threats, risks, and best practices. It involves recognizing potential dangers and knowing how to protect oneself and organizational assets from cyberattacks."
What are 'security implications'?,"Security implications are the potential consequences or effects that a particular action, event, or vulnerability could have on the security of a system, data, or organization. Understanding these implications is crucial for risk assessment and decision-making."
What does it mean to 'respond effectively to the attack'?,"Responding effectively to an attack means implementing timely and appropriate actions to mitigate the damage, contain the threat, eradicate the attacker's presence, and recover affected systems and data. It requires a well-defined incident response plan and skilled personnel."
What is the significance of the attacker compromising 'user and administrator accounts'?,"Compromising user and administrator accounts gives the attacker elevated privileges and broader access within the network. Administrator accounts, in particular, have extensive control over systems, allowing attackers to make significant changes, deploy malware, and access sensitive data."
What is the difference between a user account and an administrator account?,"A user account typically has standard permissions to access and use system resources and applications. An administrator account, on the other hand, has elevated privileges that allow it to manage the system, install software, change settings, and control user access. Compromising administrator accounts is a critical security breach."
What is the purpose of 'joint investigations' between IHIS and CSA?,"Joint investigations between IHIS and CSA are conducted to pool resources and expertise from both organizations to thoroughly examine the cyberattack. This collaboration aims to identify the scope of the breach, understand the attacker's methods, and develop effective remediation strategies."
