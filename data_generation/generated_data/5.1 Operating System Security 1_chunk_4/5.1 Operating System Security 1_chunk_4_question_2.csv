What is a Capability List (C-List)?,"A Capability List, or C-List, is a mechanism used in access control that specifies the authorized objects and operations for a particular user. It is a method of implementing an access control matrix by decomposition, specifically by rows, where each row corresponds to a user and lists the resources they can access and the operations they can perform on those resources."
"How is an access control matrix typically implemented in practice, according to the document?","In practice, an access control matrix, which is often sparse (meaning most entries are empty), can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways. The document specifically highlights ""decomposition by rows"" as a method, which leads to the use of Capability Lists (C-Lists)."
What is the primary benefit of using a C-List for access rights management?,"The primary benefit of using a Capability List (C-List) for access rights management is its convenience when determining the access rights available to a specific user. Since a C-List specifies all authorized objects and operations for a particular user, it simplifies the process of querying what a user is permitted to do."
"Explain the concept of ""decomposition by rows"" in the context of implementing an access control matrix.","Decomposition by rows, in the context of implementing an access control matrix, refers to organizing access control information such that each row represents a subject (e.g., a user) and lists all the objects (e.g., files) that subject can access, along with the specific operations (e.g., read, write, execute) they are authorized to perform on those objects. This method is typically implemented using Capability Lists (C-Lists)."
"How are various system components like files, directories, and I/O devices uniformly treated in a Unix OS?","In a Unix OS, various system components such as files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. This consistent treatment simplifies resource management and access control within the operating system."
What are the two fundamental characteristics of resources in Unix OS concerning access control?,"The two fundamental characteristics of resources in Unix OS concerning access control are: first, these resources are the objects of access control, meaning permissions are defined for them; and second, each resource has a single user owner and a single group owner, which are crucial for determining access rights."
"List the key pieces of information provided in a Unix file listing, as depicted in the document.","A Unix file listing, as depicted, typically provides several key pieces of information about a resource: the File type, File permissions (read/write/execute), Link counter (the number of directory entries pointing to the file), Username (of the owner), Group name (of the owner group), File size, and Modified date/time."
"Define ""Link counter"" as it appears in Unix file information.","The ""Link counter"" in Unix file information refers to the number of hard links, which are directory entries that point to the same physical file on the disk. A higher link counter indicates that multiple names or paths refer to the same underlying file data."
What does the file type indicator 'd' represent in a Unix file listing?,"In a Unix file listing, the file type indicator 'd' represents a directory. A directory is a special type of file that contains references to other files and directories, organizing the file system hierarchy."
What does the file type indicator 's' represent in a Unix file listing?,"In a Unix file listing, the file type indicator 's' represents a socket. A socket is an endpoint for communication between processes, often used for network communication."
What does the file type indicator 'b' represent in a Unix file listing?,"In a Unix file listing, the file type indicator 'b' represents a block device file. A block device file is a special file that provides an interface to hardware devices that handle data in fixed-size blocks, such as hard drives or CD-ROM drives."
What does the file type indicator 'l' represent in a Unix file listing?,"In a Unix file listing, the file type indicator 'l' represents a symbolic link, also known as a soft link or symlink. A symbolic link is a special type of file that points to another file or directory by its path, similar to a shortcut."
What does the file type indicator 'c' represent in a Unix file listing?,"In a Unix file listing, the file type indicator 'c' represents a character device file. A character device file is a special file that provides an interface to hardware devices that handle data as a stream of characters, such as keyboards, mice, or serial ports."
What are the three basic permissions used in Unix permission representation?,"The three basic permissions used in Unix permission representation are Read, Write, and Execute. These permissions define the types of operations that can be performed on a file or directory."
Who are the three subjects to whom permissions are assigned in Unix?,"In Unix, permissions are assigned to three distinct subjects: the Owner (the user who owns the file), the Group (the group associated with the file), and Other (all other users on the system)."
Describe the access rights granted by the permission string `rw-r--r--`.,"The permission string `rw-r--r--` grants the following access rights: the owner has read and write access (`rw-`), the group has only read access (`r--`), and other users also have only read access (`r--`). The hyphen (`-`) indicates the absence of a particular permission."
Describe the access rights granted by the permission string `rwx------`.,"The permission string `rwx------` grants the following access rights: the owner has read, write, and execute access (`rwx`), while both the group and other users have no rights whatsoever (`------`). The hyphen (`-`) indicates the absence of a particular permission."
How is the permission string `rw-r--r--` represented in octal notation?,"The permission string `rw-r--r--` is represented as `644` in octal notation. This is derived by assigning numeric values to permissions (Read=4, Write=2, Execute=1) and summing them for each subject: owner (rw- = 4+2+0 = 6), group (r-- = 4+0+0 = 4), and other (r-- = 4+0+0 = 4)."
How is the permission string `rwx------` represented in octal notation?,"The permission string `rwx------` is represented as `700` in octal notation. This is derived by assigning numeric values to permissions (Read=4, Write=2, Execute=1) and summing them for each subject: owner (rwx = 4+2+1 = 7), group (--- = 0+0+0 = 0), and other (--- = 0+0+0 = 0)."
Provide an example of a `chmod` command used by users to change file permissions using numeric mode.,"An example of a `chmod` command used by users to change file permissions using numeric (octal) mode is `chmod 754 filename`. In this command, `754` sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (7), read and execute for the group (5), and only read for others (4)."
Provide an example of a `chmod` command used by users to change file permissions using symbolic mode.,"An example of a `chmod` command used by users to change file permissions using symbolic mode is `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename`. This command grants the owner (u) write, read, and execute; grants the group (g) read and execute but removes write; and grants others (o) read but removes write and execute."
"Who has the authority to change file ownerships in Unix-like systems, and what command is used for this purpose?","In Unix-like systems, only the root user has the authority to change file ownerships. The command used for this purpose is `chown`, with an example being `chown user:group filename`, which changes both the user owner and the group owner of the specified file."
"What is ""Controlled Invocation"" in the context of operating systems?","""Controlled Invocation"" refers to the mechanism by which certain operating system functions, which typically require elevated privileges (like superuser privilege), can be executed in a controlled manner, often allowing normal users to perform specific privileged tasks without granting them full superuser access."
"What type of privilege is necessary to execute certain operating system functions, such as changing a user's password?","Superuser privilege is necessary to execute certain operating system functions, such as changing a user's password. This is because sensitive files, like the one storing user passwords, are typically owned by the root superuser and are not directly accessible by normal users."
"Where are user passwords typically stored in a Unix-like system, and what is the ownership of this file?","In a Unix-like system, user passwords are typically stored in the file `/etc/shadow`. This file is owned by the root superuser, meaning a normal user has no direct access to it, ensuring its security."
"Explain the mechanism that allows a normal user to change their password using the `passwd` program, despite the password file being owned by root.","A normal user can change their password using the `passwd` program despite the password file (`/etc/shadow`) being owned by root due to a special permission flag called SUID (Set User ID). When SUID is enabled on the `passwd` program, the user executing it temporarily inherits the permissions of the program's owner, which is root. This allows the `passwd` program to write the new password to `/etc/shadow` on behalf of the normal user."
What is SUID in the context of file permissions?,"SUID, or Set User ID, is a special permission flag for a program. When SUID is enabled on an executable file, it allows the user who executes that program to inherit the permissions of the program's owner, rather than executing with their own permissions. This is often used to grant temporary elevated privileges for specific tasks."
What is the effect of the SUID flag when a program is executed by a user?,"When a program with the SUID flag enabled is executed by a user, the user inherits the permissions of the program's owner. This means if the program is owned by root and has SUID set, a normal user executing it will temporarily gain root privileges for the duration of that program's execution, allowing it to perform actions that normally require root access."
How is the SUID permission flag visually indicated in a file's permission string?,"The SUID permission flag is visually indicated in a file's permission string by an 's' character in place of the 'x' (execute) permission for the owner. For example, `-rwsr-xr-x` indicates that the owner has read, write, and SUID (execute) permissions."
Name some common SUID programs that are typically owned by the root user.,"Some common SUID programs that are typically owned by the root user include `/bin/login` (for user login), `/bin/at` (for batch job submission), and `/bin/su` (for changing user ID). These programs require elevated privileges to perform their functions."
What are the primary potential dangers associated with SUID programs?,"The primary potential dangers associated with SUID programs are that, because the user gains the program owner's privileges, the program might be tricked into doing unintended things. This could allow an attacker to act as the root user if they can exploit a SUID program owned by root, leading to severe security breaches."
How can an attacker potentially exploit a SUID program owned by root?,"An attacker can potentially exploit a SUID program owned by root by tricking it into performing unintended actions. Since the SUID program executes with root privileges, if an attacker can manipulate its input or environment to make it execute arbitrary commands or access unauthorized resources, they can effectively act as the root user, gaining full control over the system."
What are the critical security considerations for SUID programs?,"The critical security considerations for SUID programs include: processing all user input (including command line arguments and environment variables) with extreme care, ensuring that programs only have SUID status if it is absolutely necessary, and continuously monitoring the integrity of SUID programs to detect any tampering or unauthorized modifications."
"Why is it crucial to process all user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, with extreme care for SUID programs?","It is crucial to process all user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, with extreme care for SUID programs because these programs run with elevated privileges (those of the owner, often root). Malicious input could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the program, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized actions with the program's elevated permissions, effectively acting as the root user."
Under what condition should a program be granted SUID status?,"A program should be granted SUID status only if it is really necessary. This means SUID should be applied exclusively to programs that absolutely require elevated privileges to perform a specific, controlled function, and where the security implications have been thoroughly assessed and mitigated."
Why is monitoring the integrity of SUID programs important?,"Monitoring the integrity of SUID programs is important because if an attacker modifies a SUID program, they could embed malicious code that would then execute with elevated privileges every time the program is run. Monitoring helps detect unauthorized changes, preventing potential exploits and maintaining system security."
"What are the four main purposes of logging, monitoring, and auditing in a system?","The four main purposes of logging, monitoring, and auditing in a system are: Intrusion detection (identifying unauthorized access or system changes), Forensics and investigation (providing historical data for incident response), Accountability (tracking user actions and commands), and Performance monitoring (assisting in debugging applications and diagnosing issues)."
"What is the purpose of ""Intrusion detection"" within logging, monitoring, and auditing?","Within logging, monitoring, and auditing, the purpose of ""Intrusion detection"" is to identify unauthorized access attempts or system changes. By analyzing logs and monitored data, systems can detect patterns or anomalies indicative of a security breach or malicious activity."
"What role does ""Forensics and investigation"" play in logging, monitoring, and auditing?","In logging, monitoring, and auditing, ""Forensics and investigation"" plays the role of providing historical data for incident response. Logs serve as a crucial record of past events, allowing security professionals to reconstruct timelines, identify the scope of a breach, and understand how an incident occurred."
"How does ""Accountability"" relate to logging, monitoring, and auditing?","Accountability relates to logging, monitoring, and auditing by tracking user actions and commands. Logs provide a record of who did what, when, and where, which is essential for holding individuals responsible for their activities on a system and for maintaining an audit trail."
"What is the purpose of ""Performance monitoring"" in the context of logging and auditing?","In the context of logging and auditing, the purpose of ""Performance monitoring"" is to assist in debugging applications and diagnosing system issues. By collecting data on resource usage, system calls, and other activities, logs can help identify bottlenecks, errors, or inefficiencies that affect system performance."
"What are the main challenges encountered in logging, monitoring, and auditing?","The main challenges encountered in logging, monitoring, and auditing include: high storage and processing requirements (necessitating precise selection of critical data), the risk of attackers erasing or modifying logs (requiring data protection like encryption and access control), and the potential to compromise user privacy (requiring adherence to compliance and retention policies)."
How can the challenge of logs being erased or modified by attackers be mitigated?,"The challenge of logs being erased or modified by attackers can be mitigated by well protecting the data. This includes implementing measures such as encryption to secure log contents and robust access control mechanisms to restrict who can view, modify, or delete log files."
"What is a significant privacy concern related to logging, monitoring, and auditing, and how should it be addressed?","A significant privacy concern related to logging, monitoring, and auditing is that it may compromise user privacy, as detailed records of user activities can be collected. This concern should be addressed by following strict compliance and retention policies, ensuring that only necessary data is collected, stored securely, and retained only for as long as legally or operationally required."
List at least five different types of data collected by the OS for monitoring purposes.,"The OS collects different types of data at various layers for monitoring purposes, including: System call traces, Log files, File integrity checksums, Registry access (specific to Windows), Kernel and driver-level monitoring, Resource usage, and Network activities."
"What do ""System call traces"" describe in the context of monitored data?","In the context of monitored data, ""System call traces"" describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. System calls are the interface between an application and the operating system kernel, so tracing them provides detailed insight into what a program is doing."
"What kind of information is typically recorded in a ""Log file""?","A ""Log file"" typically records information on user activity, including user login records, history of commands executed, and other system events. These files serve as a chronological record of operations and occurrences within the system."
What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. It monitors network traffic or system activities for suspicious patterns or anomalies that may indicate a security breach or policy violation.
What are the three logical components that constitute an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: Sensors, which are responsible for collecting data; Analyzers, which are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and identifying possible evidence; and a User interface, which enables a user to view output from the system or control its behavior."
"Describe the function of ""Analyzers"" within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).","Within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), ""Analyzers"" are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and identifying the possible evidence. They process the data collected by the sensors, apply detection rules or algorithms, and may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the detected intrusion."
