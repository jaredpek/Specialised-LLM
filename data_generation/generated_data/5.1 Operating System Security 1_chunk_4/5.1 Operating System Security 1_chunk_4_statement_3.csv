Define a Capability List (C-List) and explain its primary function.,"A Capability List (C-List) specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user. It is a mechanism used in access control, where an access control matrix, which is often sparse, can be implemented by decomposition, typically by rows. The C-List is particularly convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user."
"How is an access control matrix typically implemented in practice, according to the document?","In practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse and can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways. One common method mentioned is decomposition by rows, which leads to the concept of a Capability List (C-List)."
Explain why a C-List is considered convenient in access control systems.,"A C-List is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user. This is because it directly lists all authorized objects and operations associated with that particular user, making it straightforward to ascertain their permissions."
"In the context of Unix OS, what types of entities are uniformly treated as resources?","In the context of Unix OS, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are the objects of access control within the system."
What are the fundamental characteristics of resources in Unix OS regarding ownership and access control?,"In Unix OS, resources, which include files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices, are the objects of access control. Each resource has a single user owner and a single group owner, defining who has primary control and who shares access."
List and define the different file types indicated by the first character in a Unix file listing.,The different file types indicated by the first character in a Unix file listing are:\n- '-': Represents a regular file.\n- 'd': Represents a directory.\n- 's': Represents a socket.\n- 'b': Represents a block device file.\n- 'l': Represents a symbolic link.\n- 'c': Represents a character device file.
What information does the 'Link counter' field provide in a Unix file listing?,"The 'Link counter' field in a Unix file listing indicates the number of links, which refers to the number of directory entries pointing to the file. This essentially tells how many different names or paths lead to the same file content."
Describe the three primary permissions associated with files in Unix-like systems.,"The three primary permissions associated with files in Unix-like systems are Read, Write, and Execute. These permissions determine the actions that can be performed on a file or directory by different subjects (owner, group, other)."
Who are the three subjects for whom permissions are typically defined in Unix-like systems?,"The three subjects for whom permissions are typically defined in Unix-like systems are the Owner, the Group, and Other users. Each of these subjects can have different Read, Write, and Execute permissions for a given resource."
Explain the meaning of the permission string 'rw-r--r--'.,"The permission string 'rw-r--r--' signifies that the owner has read and write access ('rw-'), the group has only read access ('r--'), and other users also have only read access ('r--'). The hyphens indicate the absence of a particular permission."
What does the permission string 'rwx------' indicate?,"The permission string 'rwx------' indicates that the owner has read, write, and execute access ('rwx'). In contrast, both the group and other users have no rights whatsoever ('---') to the file or directory."
How is the permission string 'rw-r--r--' represented in octal notation?,"The permission string 'rw-r--r--' is represented in octal notation as 644. This is derived by assigning numerical values to permissions: Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1. For 'rw-r--r--', the owner has rw- (4+2=6), the group has r-- (4=4), and others have r-- (4=4), resulting in 644."
Convert the permission string 'rwx------' into its octal representation.,"The permission string 'rwx------' is converted into its octal representation as 700. This is calculated by assigning numerical values: Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1. For 'rwx------', the owner has rwx (4+2+1=7), the group has --- (0=0), and others have --- (0=0), resulting in 700."
How can users change file permissions using the `chmod` command with octal notation?,"Users can change file permissions using the `chmod` command with octal notation by specifying the desired octal value followed by the filename. For example, `chmod 754 filename` would set permissions to rwx for the owner, r-x for the group, and r-- for others."
Provide an example of how users can adjust permissions using symbolic modes with the `chmod` command.,"Users can adjust permissions using symbolic modes with the `chmod` command. An example is `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename`. This command grants the owner (u) write, read, and execute permissions; grants the group (g) read and execute permissions while removing write; and grants others (o) read permission while removing write and execute."
"Which user has the capability to change the ownerships of files and directories in Unix-like systems, and what command is used?","The `root` user has the capability to change the ownerships of files and directories in Unix-like systems. The command used for this purpose is `chown`, followed by the new user and group, and then the filename. An example is `chown user:group filename`."
"What is Superuser privilege required for, according to the document?","Superuser privilege is required to execute certain OS functions. An example provided is the process of password changing, which involves modifying sensitive system files."
"Where are user passwords stored in a Unix-like system, and who typically owns this file?","User passwords are stored in the file `/etc/shadow`. This file is typically owned by the `root` superuser, and a normal user has no direct access to it."
"Describe the process by which a normal user can change their password using the `passwd` program, despite not having direct access to `/etc/shadow`.","When a normal user wants to change their password with the program `passwd`, this program needs to be able to give the user additional permissions to write to `/etc/shadow`. This is achieved through a special permission flag called SUID, which allows the `passwd` program to execute with the permissions of its owner (root) temporarily."
Define SUID as a special permission flag for a program.,"SUID (Set User ID) is a special permission flag for a program. If SUID is enabled, then the user who executes this program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner. This allows a program to run with elevated privileges, typically those of the root user, even when executed by a normal user."
How does the SUID flag enable a normal user to write a new password to `/etc/shadow`?,"When a normal user executes a program like `passwd` that has the SUID flag enabled, the program runs with the permissions of its owner, which in the case of `passwd` is `root`. This allows the `passwd` program to gain additional root permission to write the new password to `/etc/shadow`, a file normally inaccessible to regular users."
"What does the 's' character signify in the execute permission field for the owner of a file, as seen in `ls -al /usr/bin/passwd` output?","The 's' character in the execute permission field for the owner (e.g., `-rwsr-xr-x`) signifies that the execute permission of the owner is given as 's' instead of 'x'. This indicates that the SUID (Set User ID) flag is enabled for that program, meaning it will run with the owner's permissions, typically root, when executed by any user."
List some other SUID programs that are commonly owned by the root user.,"Some other SUID programs that are commonly owned by the root user include:\n- `/bin/login`: Used for user login.\n- `/bin/at`: Used for batch job submission.\n- `/bin/su`: Used to change user ID (switch to another user, often root)."
What are the potential dangers associated with SUID programs?,"The potential dangers associated with SUID programs are significant because the user gains the program owner's privileges when running it. This means:\n1. The program should only do what the owner intended, as unintended actions could be performed with elevated privileges.\n2. By tricking a SUID program owned by root to do unintended things, an attacker can effectively act as the root user, leading to severe security breaches."
What are the key security considerations for SUID programs to mitigate potential risks?,"Key security considerations for SUID programs to mitigate potential risks include:\n1. All user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care to prevent exploitation.\n2. Programs should only be granted SUID status if it is absolutely necessary for their functionality.\n3. The integrity of SUID programs must be continuously monitored to detect any unauthorized modifications or malicious behavior."
"What are the four main purposes of Logging, Monitoring & Auditing?","The four main purposes of Logging, Monitoring & Auditing are:\n1.  **Intrusion detection:** To identify unauthorized access or system changes.\n2.  **Forensics and investigation:** To provide historical data for incident response and analysis.\n3.  **Accountability:** To track user actions and commands, establishing a record of activities.\n4.  **Performance monitoring:** To assist in debugging applications and diagnosing system issues."
"Identify the challenges associated with Logging, Monitoring & Auditing.","The challenges associated with Logging, Monitoring & Auditing include:\n1.  **High storage and processing requirements:** It necessitates precisely selecting and recording only the most critical data to manage resources effectively.\n2.  **Risk of log tampering:** Attackers may erase or modify logs, requiring robust protection mechanisms such as encryption and access control.\n3.  **User privacy concerns:** Logging activities may compromise user privacy, requiring adherence to compliance and retention policies."
Define 'System call traces' as a type of monitored data.,"System call traces are a type of monitored data that describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. By tracking system calls, administrators can gain insight into how programs interact with the operating system kernel."
What kind of information is typically found in a 'Log file' for monitoring purposes?,"A 'Log file' typically contains information on user activity, including user login records, history of commands executed, and other system events. This data is crucial for auditing, troubleshooting, and security analysis."
Explain the concept of 'File integrity checksums' in the context of monitored data.,File integrity checksums involve periodically scanning critical files for changes and comparing cryptographic checksums for these files with a record of known good values. This process helps detect unauthorized modifications or corruption of important system files.
"What does 'Registry access' monitoring entail, and to which operating system is it specific?","'Registry access' monitoring entails observing and recording access attempts to the system registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems, as the registry is a central hierarchical database used to store configuration settings and options for the operating system and applications."
What insight does 'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provide?,"'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies. By observing activities at this fundamental level, it's possible to detect sophisticated attacks or system malfunctions that might otherwise go unnoticed."
How can 'Resource usage' monitoring indicate malicious behaviors?,"'Resource usage' monitoring, which tracks CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. Unusual spikes or patterns in resource consumption might suggest the presence of malware, unauthorized processes, or denial-of-service attacks."
What do 'Network activities' include as examples of monitored data?,"'Network activities' as examples of monitored data include established connections and received packets. Monitoring these activities helps in identifying suspicious network communications, unauthorized data transfers, or external attacks."
Define an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. Its primary function is to monitor network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produce reports to a management station.
What are the different layers at which an IDS can be implemented?,"An IDS can be implemented at different layers, including network-based IDS (NIDS) and host-based IDS (HIDS). Network-based IDS monitors network traffic, while host-based IDS monitors the characteristics of a single host."
What is the primary focus of a host-based IDS?,"The primary focus of a host-based IDS (HIDS) is to monitor the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. This includes observing system calls, log files, file integrity, registry access, and resource usage on that specific machine."
List the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: Sensors, Analyzers, and a User interface."
Describe the role of 'Sensors' within an IDS.,"Within an IDS, 'Sensors' are responsible for collecting data. These components gather raw information from various sources, such as system call traces, log files, network activities, or file integrity checksums, which is then passed on for analysis."
What is the function of 'Analyzers' in an IDS?,"The function of 'Analyzers' in an IDS is to determine if an intrusion has occurred and to identify the possible evidence. They process the data collected by sensors, apply detection rules or algorithms, and may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion."
How does the 'User interface' component of an IDS facilitate interaction?,"The 'User interface' component of an IDS facilitates interaction by enabling a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. It provides a means for administrators to configure the IDS, review alerts, and manage its operations."
"Provide an example of a C-List for user A, detailing their access rights to File 1 and File 3.","For user A, the C-List specifies the following access rights:\n- **File 1:** Read, Write, Execute\n- **File 3:** Read, Write, Execute"
Illustrate the access rights for user B based on the provided C-List example.,"Based on the provided C-List example for user B:\n- **File 1:** Read\n- **File 2:** Read, Write, Execute\n- **File 3:** Write\n- **File 4:** Read"
"What access rights does user C have to File 1, File 2, and File 4 according to the C-List example?","According to the C-List example for user C:\n- **File 1:** Read, Write\n- **File 2:** Read\n- **File 4:** Read, Write, Execute"
"In a Unix file listing, what information is conveyed by the 'Username' and 'Group name' fields?","In a Unix file listing, the 'Username' field indicates the single user owner of the resource, while the 'Group name' field indicates the single group owner of the resource. These fields define who has primary control and who shares access to the file or directory."
What is the purpose of the 'Modified date/time' field in a Unix file listing?,"The 'Modified date/time' field in a Unix file listing indicates when the file or directory was last modified. This timestamp is crucial for tracking changes, troubleshooting, and security investigations."
What is the significance of the 'File size' field in a Unix file listing?,"The 'File size' field in a Unix file listing indicates the size of the file in bytes. This information is important for understanding storage consumption, and for some file types, it can be an indicator of content or potential issues."
How does the `passwd` program utilize SUID to allow a normal user to change their password?,"The `passwd` program, which is owned by the root superuser, has the SUID flag enabled. When a normal user executes `passwd`, the program temporarily runs with root's permissions. This elevated privilege allows `passwd` to write the new password to the `/etc/shadow` file, which is normally only accessible by root, thereby enabling the password change."
Why is it important for SUID programs to only do what the owner intended?,"It is important for SUID programs to only do what the owner intended because when a user runs a SUID program, they temporarily gain the program owner's privileges. If the program performs unintended actions, these actions will be executed with elevated privileges, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or system compromise, especially if the owner is root."
What is the risk if an attacker can trick a SUID program owned by root?,"If an attacker can trick a SUID program owned by root to do unintended things, the attacker can effectively act as the root user. This grants them full control over the system, allowing them to perform any action, including modifying system files, installing malware, or creating new privileged accounts, leading to a complete system compromise."
"Why is 'Intrusion detection' a key purpose of logging, monitoring, and auditing?","'Intrusion detection' is a key purpose of logging, monitoring, and auditing because these processes help identify unauthorized access or system changes. By continuously collecting and analyzing system data, anomalies and suspicious activities that indicate a security breach can be detected."
"How do logging, monitoring, and auditing contribute to 'Accountability'?","Logging, monitoring, and auditing contribute to 'Accountability' by tracking user actions and commands. This creates a historical record of who did what, when, and where, which is essential for forensic analysis, compliance, and holding individuals responsible for their activities on a system."
