Define a Capability List (C-List) in the context of access control.,"A Capability List (C-List) specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user. It is a method of implementing an access control matrix, which is often sparse, by decomposition in one of two ways. C-Lists are particularly convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user."
Explain how an access control matrix can be implemented in practice.,"In practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse and can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways. This decomposition is typically done by rows, where each row corresponds to a user and lists the objects and operations that user is authorized to perform, as seen in a Capability List (C-List)."
Describe the primary benefit of using a C-List for access control.,"The primary benefit of using a C-List (Capability List) for access control is its convenience when determining the access rights available to a specific user. A C-List specifies all authorized objects and operations for a particular user, making it straightforward to ascertain what a user can access."
How does a C-List represent access rights for multiple files for a single user?,"A C-List represents access rights for multiple files for a single user by listing each authorized file (object) along with the specific operations (permissions) that the user is allowed to perform on that file. For instance, a user 'B' might have 'Read' access to 'File 1', 'Read', 'Write', 'Execute' access to 'File 2', 'Write' access to 'File 3', and 'Read' access to 'File 4', all specified within their C-List."
What are considered 'resources' in a Unix OS environment for the purpose of access control?,"In a Unix OS environment, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are the objects of access control, meaning that permissions and ownership are managed for them."
Describe the ownership model for resources in Unix OS.,"In Unix OS, each resource, such as a file or directory, has a single user owner and a single group owner. This ownership model dictates who has primary control over the resource's permissions."
"List the key pieces of information associated with a file entry in Unix OS, as shown in the example.","A file entry in Unix OS includes several key pieces of information: the file type (e.g., file, directory, socket), file permissions (Read/write/execute), the link counter (number of directory entries pointing to the file), the username of the owner, the group name of the owner, the file size, and the modified date/time."
Define the various file types indicated in a Unix OS file listing.,"In a Unix OS file listing, different characters indicate various file types: '-' denotes a regular file, 'd' denotes a directory, 's' denotes a socket, 'b' denotes a block device file, 'l' denotes a symbolic link, and 'c' denotes a character device file."
What does the 'link counter' represent in a Unix file entry?,"The 'link counter' in a Unix file entry represents the number of links, which are essentially directory entries, pointing to that specific file. This indicates how many different names or paths refer to the same underlying file data."
Explain the significance of 'username' and 'group name' in Unix resource management.,"In Unix resource management, 'username' identifies the individual user who owns the resource, and 'group name' identifies the group that owns the resource. These owners are crucial for determining access control, as permissions are often defined for the owner, the group, and others."
What are the three fundamental permissions and three subjects used in Unix permission representation?,"The three fundamental permissions used in Unix permission representation are Read, Write, and Execute. These permissions are applied to three distinct subjects: the Owner of the file, the Group associated with the file, and Other users (anyone who is not the owner or part of the group)."
Interpret the Unix permission string 'rw-r--r--'.,"The Unix permission string 'rw-r--r--' indicates that the owner has read and write access ('rw-'), the group has read access ('r--'), and other users also have read access ('r--')."
Interpret the Unix permission string 'rwx------'.,"The Unix permission string 'rwx------' indicates that the owner has read, write, and execute access ('rwx'), while the group has no rights ('---'), and other users also have no rights ('---')."
How is the permission string 'rw-r--r--' represented in octal notation?,"The permission string 'rw-r--r--' is represented in octal notation as 644. This is derived by assigning numerical values: Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1. For 'rw-r--r--', the owner's permissions (rw-) sum to 4+2=6, the group's (r--) sum to 4, and others' (r--) sum to 4, resulting in 644."
How is the permission string 'rwx------' represented in octal notation?,"The permission string 'rwx------' is represented in octal notation as 700. This is derived by assigning numerical values: Read (r) = 4, Write (w) = 2, Execute (x) = 1. For 'rwx------', the owner's permissions (rwx) sum to 4+2+1=7, the group's (---) sum to 0, and others' (---) sum to 0, resulting in 700."
Provide an example of how a user can change file permissions using the 'chmod' command with octal notation.,"A user can change file permissions using the 'chmod' command with octal notation. For example, `chmod 754 filename` would set the owner's permissions to read, write, and execute (7), the group's permissions to read and execute (5), and others' permissions to read (4) for the specified 'filename'."
Provide an example of how a user can change file permissions using the 'chmod' command with symbolic notation.,"A user can change file permissions using the 'chmod' command with symbolic notation. For example, `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename` would add write, read, and execute for the user, add read and execute for the group, remove write for the group, add read for others, and remove write and execute for others on 'filename'."
How can the root user change the ownership of a file in Unix?,"The root user can change the ownership of a file in Unix using the 'chown' command. The syntax is `chown user:group filename`, where 'user' is the new owner's username and 'group' is the new group name for the specified 'filename'."
"What type of privilege is necessary to execute certain OS functions, and provide an example.","Superuser privilege is necessary to execute certain OS functions. An example of such a function is password changing, which involves modifying sensitive system files."
"Where are user passwords stored in a Unix-like system, and who typically owns this file?","User passwords are stored in the file `/etc/shadow`. This file is typically owned by the root superuser, and a normal user usually has no direct access to it."
Explain the challenge a normal user faces when trying to change their password using the `passwd` program.,"When a normal user wants to change their password with the `passwd` program, the program needs additional permissions to write to the `/etc/shadow` file, which stores user passwords and is owned by the root superuser. A normal user typically lacks direct write access to this file."
Define SUID in the context of program permissions.,"SUID (Set User ID) is a special permission flag for a program. If SUID is enabled, then a user who executes this program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner, rather than executing it with their own permissions."
How does the `passwd` program utilize SUID to allow normal users to change their passwords?,"The `passwd` program utilizes SUID to allow normal users to change their passwords. When a normal user executes the `passwd` program, and if `passwd` has the SUID flag enabled and is owned by root, the user temporarily gains the root's permissions to write the new password to the `/etc/shadow` file, which is otherwise inaccessible to them."
"How is the SUID permission indicated in a file's permission string, specifically for the owner's execute permission?","The SUID permission is indicated in a file's permission string by an 's' character in place of the 'x' (execute) permission for the owner. For example, `-rwsr-xr-x` shows that the owner has read, write, and SUID execute permissions."
List some common SUID programs that are typically owned by root.,"Some common SUID programs that are typically owned by root include `/bin/login` (used for user login), `/bin/at` (used for batch job submission), and `/bin/su` (used to change user ID)."
What is a primary potential danger associated with SUID programs?,"A primary potential danger associated with SUID programs is that as the user has the program owner's privileges when running a SUID program, the program might be tricked into doing unintended things. If a SUID program is owned by root, an attacker could exploit it to act as the root user, gaining full system control."
What is a key security consideration regarding user input for SUID programs?,"A key security consideration regarding user input for SUID programs is that all user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care. This is because malicious input could potentially trick the SUID program into performing unintended actions with elevated privileges."
Under what circumstances should a program be granted SUID status?,"A program should be granted SUID status only if it is really necessary. This is a critical security consideration because SUID programs run with the owner's privileges, which can be exploited if not carefully managed."
What measure should be taken to ensure the ongoing security of SUID programs?,"To ensure the ongoing security of SUID programs, their integrity must be monitored. This involves regularly checking for unauthorized modifications or tampering that could compromise their intended functionality and introduce vulnerabilities."
"What are the four main purposes of logging, monitoring, and auditing?","The four main purposes of logging, monitoring, and auditing are: 1.

"What are the challenges associated with the storage and processing requirements for logging, monitoring, and auditing?","One challenge associated with logging, monitoring, and auditing is the high storage and processing requirements. To mitigate this, it is necessary to precisely select and record only the most critical data, rather than logging everything indiscriminately."
How can logs be protected from attackers who might try to erase or modify them?,"Logs can be protected from attackers who might try to erase or modify them by implementing robust security measures. These measures include well protecting the data, for example, via encryption and access control mechanisms, to ensure their integrity and confidentiality."
"What is a privacy concern related to logging, monitoring, and auditing, and how should it be addressed?","A privacy concern related to logging, monitoring, and auditing is that it may compromise user privacy. To address this, organizations must follow compliance and retention policies, ensuring that data collection and storage adhere to legal and ethical guidelines regarding user data."
What are 'System call traces' and what information do they provide?,System call traces describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. They provide detailed information about the interactions between applications and the operating system kernel.
What kind of information is typically found in a 'Log file' for monitoring purposes?,"A 'Log file' for monitoring purposes typically contains information on user activity, including user login records, history of commands executed, and other system events."
Explain the concept of 'File integrity checksums' in the context of monitored data.,File integrity checksums involve periodically scanning critical files for changes and comparing cryptographic checksums for these files with a record of known good values. This helps detect unauthorized modifications or tampering with important system files.
"What does 'Registry access' monitoring entail, and for which operating system is it specific?","'Registry access' monitoring entails observing access patterns to the system registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems, as the registry is a central hierarchical database used to store configuration settings and options."
What insights can 'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provide?,"'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies. By observing the activities at this fundamental level of the operating system, it's possible to detect sophisticated attacks or system malfunctions."
How can 'Resource usage' monitoring indicate malicious behavior?,"'Resource usage' monitoring, which tracks CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. Unusual spikes or patterns in resource consumption might suggest the presence of malware or an attack."
What information is included in 'Network activities' monitoring?,"'Network activities' monitoring includes information about established connections and received packets. This data is crucial for detecting unauthorized network communications, data exfiltration, or other network-based attacks."
Define an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. Its primary function is to monitor system or network activities for malicious or policy-violating events and alert administrators.
What are the different layers at which an IDS can be implemented?,"An IDS can be implemented at different layers, including network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitors network traffic, and host-based IDS (HIDS), which monitors the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities."
What are the three logical components that comprise an IDS?,"An IDS comprises three logical components: Sensors, Analyzers, and a User interface. Each component plays a distinct role in the detection and reporting process."
Describe the role of 'Sensors' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"In an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), 'Sensors' are responsible for collecting data. This data can come from various sources, such as network traffic, system logs, or file integrity checks, which are then fed to the analyzers for evaluation."
Describe the role of 'Analyzers' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"In an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), 'Analyzers' are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and identifying the possible evidence. They may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion, based on the data collected by sensors."
Describe the role of the 'User interface' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"In an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the 'User interface' enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. It provides a means for administrators to interact with the IDS, review alerts, and configure its settings."
