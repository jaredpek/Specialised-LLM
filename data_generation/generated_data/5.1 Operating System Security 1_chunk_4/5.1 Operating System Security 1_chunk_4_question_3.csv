What is a Capability List (C-List)?,"A Capability List (C-List) is a mechanism used in practice to implement an access control matrix, which is often sparse. It specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user. C-Lists are convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user."
How is an access control matrix typically implemented in practice?,"In practice, an access control matrix, which is usually sparse, can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways. One common method is decomposition by rows, which leads to the concept of a Capability List (C-List)."
What does a C-list specify?,A C-list specifies the authorized objects and the operations that a particular user is permitted to perform on those objects. This provides a clear view of a user's access rights.
When is a C-List particularly convenient?,A C-List is particularly convenient when the task involves determining the access rights that are available to a specific user. This is because the C-List directly lists all authorized objects and operations for that user.
"Describe the concept of ""Decomposition by rows"" in the context of access control.","Decomposition by rows is one of two ways to implement an access control matrix, especially when the matrix is sparse. This method leads to the creation of Capability Lists (C-Lists), where each C-List specifies the authorized objects and operations for a particular user. For example, user A might have a C-List detailing read, write, and execute permissions for File 1 and File 3."
"How are files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices treated in a Unix OS?","In a Unix Operating System (OS), files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are the fundamental objects of access control within the system."
What are the objects of access control in Unix OS?,"In a Unix Operating System (OS), the objects of access control are uniformly treated resources, which include files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices."
What ownership properties do resources have in Unix OS?,"In a Unix Operating System (OS), each resource has a single user owner and a single group owner. These owners determine the primary access rights to the resource."
What information is typically associated with a file entry in Unix OS?,"A file entry in Unix OS typically includes several pieces of information:\n*   ""File type"": Indicates whether it's a regular file, directory, socket, block device, symbolic link, or character device.\n*   ""File permissions"": Specifies read, write, and execute rights for the owner, group, and others.\n*   ""Link counter"": The number of directory entries pointing to the file.\n*   ""Username"": The user who owns the file.\n*   ""Group name"": The group that owns the file.\n*   ""File size"": The size of the file in bytes.\n*   ""Modified date/time"": The timestamp of the last modification."
Define 'File type' in Unix OS.,"In Unix OS, 'File type' is an attribute that categorizes a file or resource. Common file types include:\n*   ""-"": a regular file\n*   ""d"": a directory\n*   ""s"": a socket\n*   ""b"": a block device file\n*   ""l"": a symbolic link\n*   ""c"": a character device file"
What does 'Link counter' refer to in Unix OS file management?,"In Unix OS file management, the 'Link counter' refers to the number of hard links, which are directory entries, that point to a specific file. Each hard link increments this counter."
What are 'File permissions' in Unix OS?,"'File permissions' in Unix OS define the access rights for a file or directory. These permissions specify whether the owner, group, or other users can read, write, or execute the file. They are typically represented by a combination of 'r' (read), 'w' (write), and 'x' (execute) characters."
Explain the meaning of the Unix permission string `rw-r--r--`.,"The Unix permission string `rw-r--r--` indicates specific access rights for a file or directory.\n*   `rw-`: The first three characters grant read (`r`) and write (`w`) access to the ""owner"" of the file. The hyphen (`-`) indicates no execute permission.\n*   `r--`: The next three characters grant read (`r`) access to the ""group"" that owns the file. No write or execute permissions are granted.\n*   `r--`: The last three characters grant read (`r`) access to ""other"" users (those who are neither the owner nor part of the owning group). No write or execute permissions are granted."
What does the Unix permission string `rwx------` signify?,"The Unix permission string `rwx------` signifies the following access rights:\n*   `rwx`: The first three characters grant read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) access to the ""owner"" of the file.\n*   `---`: The next three characters indicate that the ""group"" that owns the file has no read, write, or execute rights.\n*   `---`: The last three characters indicate that ""other"" users (neither the owner nor part of the owning group) also have no read, write, or execute rights."
What is Octal Representation in Unix permissions?,"Octal Representation is a numerical method to express Unix file permissions. Each set of three permissions (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others is assigned a numerical value: read (4), write (2), and execute (1). The sum of these values for each subject (owner, group, other) forms a three-digit octal number. For example, `rw-` is 4+2+0=6, `r--` is 4+0+0=4, and `rwx` is 4+2+1=7."
How is the Unix permission `rw-r--r--` represented in octal?,The Unix permission `rw-r--r--` is represented in octal as `644`.\n*   `rw-` (owner): read (4) + write (2) + no execute (0) = 6\n*   `r--` (group): read (4) + no write (0) + no execute (0) = 4\n*   `r--` (other): read (4) + no write (0) + no execute (0) = 4\nCombining these gives `644`.
How is the Unix permission `rwx------` represented in octal?,The Unix permission `rwx------` is represented in octal as `700`.\n*   `rwx` (owner): read (4) + write (2) + execute (1) = 7\n*   `---` (group): no read (0) + no write (0) + no execute (0) = 0\n*   `---` (other): no read (0) + no write (0) + no execute (0) = 0\nCombining these gives `700`.
How can users adjust permissions in Unix?,"Users can adjust permissions in Unix using the `chmod` command. This command allows changing the read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others. Examples include `chmod 754 filename` (using octal representation) or `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename` (using symbolic representation)."
How can the root user change ownerships in Unix?,"The root user, possessing superuser privileges, can change the ownerships of files and directories in Unix using the `chown` command. The syntax typically involves specifying the new user and group owner, for example, `chown user:group filename`."
What is the purpose of the `chmod` command in Unix?,"The `chmod` command in Unix is used by users to change the permissions of files and directories. It allows specifying read, write, and execute access for the file's owner, its group, and other users, either using octal notation or symbolic modes."
What is the purpose of the `chown` command in Unix?,The `chown` command in Unix is used by the root user to change the ownership of files and directories. It allows assigning a new user owner and optionally a new group owner to a specified file or directory.
What is Controlled Invocation?,"Controlled Invocation refers to a mechanism where specific operating system (OS) functions require superuser privilege to be executed. This ensures that critical system operations are only performed by authorized entities, preventing unauthorized access or modification."
"What privilege is required to execute certain OS functions, such as password changing?","Superuser privilege is required to execute certain operating system (OS) functions, such as changing passwords. This elevated privilege ensures that sensitive operations are protected from unauthorized access."
"Where are user passwords stored in Unix, and who owns that file?","In Unix, user passwords are stored in the file `/etc/shadow`. This file is owned by the root superuser, and a normal user has no access to it, ensuring its confidentiality and integrity."
What happens when a normal user wants to change their password with the `passwd` program?,"When a normal user wants to change their password using the `passwd` program, this program needs to be granted additional permissions to write to the `/etc/shadow` file. This is typically achieved through mechanisms like SUID, which temporarily elevates the program's privileges."
What is SUID?,"SUID, which stands for Set User ID, is a special permission flag for a program in Unix-like operating systems. If SUID is enabled for an executable program, any user who executes that program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner, rather than their own permissions, for the duration of the program's execution."
What happens if SUID is enabled for a program?,"If SUID (Set User ID) is enabled for a program, any user who executes that program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner. This means the program will run with the owner's privileges, even if the executing user has lower privileges."
How does a normal user executing `passwd` get root permission to write to `/etc/shadow`?,"A normal user executing the `passwd` program can gain additional root permission to write the new password to `/etc/shadow` because the `passwd` program itself has the SUID (Set User ID) flag enabled. Since `/etc/shadow` is owned by root, and `passwd` is also owned by root, the SUID flag allows the `passwd` program to run with root's privileges, enabling it to modify the protected password file."
How is the execute permission of the owner represented when SUID is enabled?,"When SUID (Set User ID) is enabled for a program, the execute permission of the owner is represented as `s` instead of `x` in the permission string. For example, `-rwsr-xr-x` indicates that the owner has read, write, and SUID-enabled execute permissions."
List some SUID programs that are commonly owned by root.,"Some SUID (Set User ID) programs that are commonly owned by root include:\n*   ""/bin/login"": Used for user login.\n*   ""/bin/at"": Used for batch job submission.\n*   ""/bin/su"": Used to change user ID (switch to another user, often root)."
What are the potential dangers associated with SUID programs?,"The potential dangers associated with SUID (Set User ID) programs stem from the fact that the executing user gains the program owner's privileges.\n1.  ""Unintended actions"": The program might perform actions beyond what the owner intended, especially if it can be tricked.\n2.  ""Attacker exploitation"": An attacker could exploit a SUID program owned by root to perform unintended actions, effectively acting as the root user and gaining full control over the system."
What are the security considerations for SUID programs?,"Security considerations for SUID (Set User ID) programs are critical due to their elevated privileges:\n1.  ""Careful input processing"": All user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care to prevent exploitation.\n2.  ""Necessity"": Programs should only be granted SUID status if it is absolutely necessary for their functionality.\n3.  ""Integrity monitoring"": The integrity of SUID programs must be continuously monitored to detect any unauthorized modifications."
Why should user input be processed with extreme care for SUID programs?,"User input, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care for SUID (Set User ID) programs because the user running the program temporarily gains the program owner's privileges (often root). Malicious input could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the program, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges."
When should programs be granted SUID status?,"Programs should only be granted SUID (Set User ID) status if it is absolutely necessary for their functionality. Granting SUID status unnecessarily introduces a significant security risk, as it allows users to execute the program with the owner's (potentially root) privileges."
What needs to be monitored regarding SUID programs?,"The integrity of SUID (Set User ID) programs must be monitored. This involves ensuring that the programs have not been tampered with or modified by unauthorized individuals, as any compromise could lead to privilege escalation."

What are File integrity checksums and their purpose in monitoring?,File integrity checksums are cryptographic checksums that are periodically calculated for critical files. Their purpose in monitoring is to detect unauthorized changes by comparing these current checksums with a record of known good values. Any discrepancy indicates a potential compromise or modification.
What is Registry access monitoring?,"Registry access monitoring is a type of data collection specific to Windows operating systems. It involves monitoring access to the system registry, which is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system and for applications."
What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system specifically designed to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. It monitors system or network activities for malicious activity or policy violations and can be implemented at different layers, such as network-based or host-based."
What are the three logical components of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components:\n1.  ""Sensors"": These components are responsible for collecting data from the monitored system or network.\n2.  ""Analyzers"": These components are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred based on the collected data, identifying possible evidence, and potentially providing guidance on actions to take.\n3.  ""User interface"": This component enables a user to view the output from the IDS, such as alerts or reports, and to control the behavior of the system."
