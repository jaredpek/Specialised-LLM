What is a Capability List (C-List) in the context of access control?,"A Capability List, or C-List, is a mechanism used in access control systems. It specifies the authorized objects and operations that a particular user is permitted to perform. It is a convenient method for determining the access rights available to a specific user, especially when an access control matrix, which defines permissions for subjects over objects, is sparse and can be decomposed by rows."
How is an access control matrix typically implemented in practice?,"In practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse, meaning it contains many empty entries. Due to this sparsity, it can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways: decomposition by rows, which leads to Capability Lists (C-Lists), or decomposition by columns, which leads to Access Control Lists (ACLs), though only C-Lists are detailed here."
What does 'Decomposition by rows' refer to in the context of access control matrix implementation?,"""Decomposition by rows"" is one of two ways to implement a sparse access control matrix. This method leads to the creation of Capability Lists (C-Lists). In this approach, each row of the access control matrix, which corresponds to a particular user, is extracted to form a C-List. This C-List then specifies all the authorized objects and the operations that the specific user can perform on those objects."
When is a C-List particularly convenient for access control?,"A C-List is particularly convenient when the goal is to determine the access rights available to a specific user. Since a C-List consolidates all authorized objects and operations for a particular user, it provides a straightforward way to query and understand what a given user is allowed to do across various resources."
"How are files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices treated in a Unix OS?","In a Unix OS, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. This uniform treatment simplifies resource management and access control, as all these entities are considered objects of access control."
What are the objects of access control in a Unix OS?,"In a Unix OS, the objects of access control are the various resources managed by the system. These resources include files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices, all of which are treated uniformly for the purpose of access control."
What ownership properties do resources have in a Unix OS?,"In a Unix OS, each resource has a single user owner and a single group owner. This ownership model is fundamental to the Unix permission system, allowing for granular control over who can access and modify resources based on their user and group affiliations."
"What information is typically associated with a file entry in a Unix OS, as shown in a long listing format?","A file entry in a Unix OS, when viewed in a long listing format, typically includes several pieces of information: the file type, file permissions (read/write/execute), a link counter (number of directory entries pointing to the file), the username of the owner, the group name of the owner, the file size, and the modified date/time."
List and define the different file types in Unix OS.,"The different file types in Unix OS are represented by a single character at the beginning of the permission string:
*   `'-'`: Represents a regular file.
*   `'d'`: Represents a directory.
*   `'s'`: Represents a socket.
*   `'b'`: Represents a block device file.
*   `'l'`: Represents a symbolic link.
*   `'c'`: Represents a character device file."
What is the 'Link counter' in the context of Unix file entries?,"The 'Link counter' in the context of Unix file entries refers to the number of hard links (i.e., directory entries) that point to a specific file. Each hard link is an additional name for the same underlying file data, and the link counter keeps track of how many such names exist."
What are the three fundamental permissions associated with three subjects in Unix permission representation?,"In Unix permission representation, there are three fundamental permissions: Read, Write, and Execute. These permissions are applied to three distinct subjects: the Owner of the file, the Group associated with the file, and Other users (everyone else)."
Explain the meaning of the Unix permission string 'rw-r--r--'.,"The Unix permission string 'rw-r--r--' indicates specific access rights for different subjects:
*   `rw-`: The first three characters represent the permissions for the Owner. `r` stands for read access, `w` for write access, and `-` indicates no execute access. So, the owner has read and write access.
*   `r--`: The next three characters represent the permissions for the Group. `r` stands for read access, and `--` indicates no write or execute access. So, the group has read access only.
*   `r--`: The last three characters represent the permissions for Other users. `r` stands for read access, and `--` indicates no write or execute access. So, other users have read access only."
Explain the meaning of the Unix permission string 'rwx------'.,"The Unix permission string 'rwx------' indicates specific access rights for different subjects:
*   `rwx`: The first three characters represent the permissions for the Owner. `r` stands for read access, `w` for write access, and `x` for execute access. So, the owner has read, write, and execute access.
*   `---`: The next three characters represent the permissions for the Group. `---` indicates no read, write, or execute access. So, the group has no rights.
*   `---`: The last three characters represent the permissions for Other users. `---` indicates no read, write, or execute access. So, other users have no rights."
How are Unix file permissions represented in octal format?,"Unix file permissions can be represented in octal format, where each set of three permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others is converted into a single octal digit. Read (`r`) is assigned a value of 4, Write (`w`) a value of 2, and Execute (`x`) a value of 1. If a permission is present, its value is added; if absent, it's 0. These sums for owner, group, and other then form a three-digit octal number."
What is the octal representation for the Unix permission string 'rw-r--r--'?,"The octal representation for the Unix permission string 'rw-r--r--' is 644.
*   For the owner (`rw-`): `r` (4) + `w` (2) + `-` (0) = 6.
*   For the group (`r--`): `r` (4) + `-` (0) + `-` (0) = 4.
*   For others (`r--`): `r` (4) + `-` (0) + `-` (0) = 4.
Combining these gives 644."
What is the octal representation for the Unix permission string 'rwx------'?,"The octal representation for the Unix permission string 'rwx------' is 700.
*   For the owner (`rwx`): `r` (4) + `w` (2) + `x` (1) = 7.
*   For the group (`---`): `-` (0) + `-` (0) + `-` (0) = 0.
*   For others (`---`): `-` (0) + `-` (0) + `-` (0) = 0.
Combining these gives 700."
How can users change file permissions in Unix-like systems?,"Users can change file permissions in Unix-like systems using the `chmod` command. This command allows modification of permissions using either octal notation (e.g., `chmod 754 filename`) or symbolic notation (e.g., `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename`). The `chmod` command adjusts the read, write, and execute rights for the owner, group, and other users."
Provide an example command for changing file permissions using octal mode.,"An example command for changing file permissions using octal mode is `chmod 754 filename`. In this command:
*   `7` grants the owner read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions.
*   `5` grants the group read (4) and execute (1) permissions.
*   `4` grants others read (4) permission."
Provide an example command for changing file permissions using symbolic mode.,"An example command for changing file permissions using symbolic mode is `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename`. This command specifies changes for the user (u), group (g), and others (o):
*   `u+wrx`: Adds write, read, and execute permissions for the user.
*   `g+rx`: Adds read and execute permissions for the group.
*   `g-w`: Removes write permission for the group.
*   `o+r`: Adds read permission for others.
*   `o-wx`: Removes write and execute permissions for others."
Who can change file ownerships in Unix-like systems and what command is used?,"In Unix-like systems, typically only the root user can change file ownerships. The command used for this purpose is `chown`. An example command is `chown user:group filename`, which changes both the user owner and the group owner of the specified file."
What is Controlled Invocation in the context of OS security?,"Controlled Invocation refers to mechanisms that allow specific programs or functions to execute with elevated privileges under certain conditions, even when invoked by a less privileged user. This is often necessary for system functions that require access to sensitive resources, such as changing user passwords, which requires superuser privilege to modify system files."
"What privilege is generally required to execute certain OS functions, such as changing passwords?","Superuser privilege is generally required to execute certain OS functions, such as changing passwords. This is because these functions often involve modifying sensitive system files or configurations that normal users are not permitted to access directly."
"Where are user passwords stored in a Unix-like system, and who owns this file?","In a Unix-like system, user passwords are stored in the file `/etc/shadow`. This file is owned by the root superuser, and normal users typically have no direct access to it, ensuring the security of password hashes."
Describe the process when a normal user wants to change their password using the `passwd` program.,"When a normal user wants to change their password using the `passwd` program, the program itself needs to be granted additional permissions. This is because the user's password is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file, which is owned by the root superuser and inaccessible to normal users. The `passwd` program, therefore, needs temporary root permissions to write the new password to `/etc/shadow` on behalf of the user."
What is SUID in the context of program permissions?,"SUID, which stands for Set User ID, is a special permission flag for a program. When SUID is enabled on an executable file, any user who executes that program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner, rather than executing with their own permissions. This allows less privileged users to run specific programs that require elevated privileges, such as the `passwd` program, which needs root permissions to modify the `/etc/shadow` file."
What happens if SUID is enabled for a program?,"If SUID is enabled for a program, any user who executes that program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner. For example, if a program owned by root has the SUID bit set, a normal user executing it will temporarily gain root privileges for the duration of that program's execution, allowing it to perform actions that normally only root can do."
How does a normal user executing the `passwd` program gain additional root permission to write to `/etc/shadow`?,"A normal user executing the `passwd` program gains additional root permission to write to `/etc/shadow` because the `passwd` program itself has the SUID (Set User ID) flag enabled and is owned by the root user. When the SUID-enabled `passwd` program is executed, the user temporarily inherits the permissions of the program's owner (root), allowing the program to modify the `/etc/shadow` file, which is otherwise inaccessible to normal users."
How is the execute permission of the owner represented when SUID is enabled for a file?,"When SUID is enabled for a file, the execute permission of the owner is represented as `s` instead of `x` in the permission string. For example, `-rwsr-xr-x` indicates that the owner has read, write, and SUID-enabled execute permissions."
List some common SUID programs that are typically owned by root.,"Some common SUID programs that are typically owned by root include:
*   `/bin/login`: Used for user login.
*   `/bin/at`: Used for batch job submission.
*   `/bin/su`: Used to change user ID (switch to another user, often root)."
What are the potential dangers associated with SUID programs?,"The potential dangers associated with SUID programs stem from the fact that a user gains the program owner's privileges when running them. This can lead to security vulnerabilities:
1.  The program might perform actions beyond what the owner intended, especially if it's not carefully designed.
2.  An attacker could trick a SUID program owned by root into performing unintended actions, effectively allowing the attacker to act as the root user and compromise the system."
What are the key security considerations for SUID programs?,"The key security considerations for SUID programs are:
1.  All user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care to prevent malicious exploitation.
2.  Programs should only be granted SUID status if it is absolutely necessary for their functionality.
3.  The integrity of SUID programs must be continuously monitored to detect any unauthorized modifications or tampering that could lead to security breaches."
Why should user input to SUID programs be processed with extreme care?,"User input to SUID programs, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care because the user running the program temporarily gains the program owner's privileges. Maliciously crafted input could potentially trick the SUID program into executing unintended commands or accessing unauthorized resources, allowing an attacker to escalate privileges and compromise the system."
When should programs be granted SUID status?,"Programs should be granted SUID status only if it is truly necessary for their operation. Due to the inherent security risks associated with privilege escalation, SUID should be used sparingly and only for specific functionalities that absolutely require elevated permissions, such as system utilities that modify sensitive files."
What must be monitored regarding SUID programs as a security consideration?,"As a security consideration, the integrity of SUID programs must be monitored. This involves ensuring that these programs have not been tampered with or modified by unauthorized individuals. Any changes to SUID executables could indicate a security breach or an attempt to create a backdoor, as they run with elevated privileges."

What are 'System call traces' in the context of monitored data?,"'System call traces' are a type of monitored data that describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. By tracking system calls, which are requests made by a program to the operating system's kernel, administrators can gain insight into how applications interact with the OS and its resources, helping to identify suspicious or anomalous behavior."
What kind of information is typically found in a 'Log file' for monitoring purposes?,"For monitoring purposes, a 'Log file' typically contains information on user activity, including user login records, the history of commands executed, and other system events. These logs serve as a chronological record of operations and interactions within the system, crucial for auditing, troubleshooting, and security analysis."
What are 'File integrity checksums' used for in monitoring?,"'File integrity checksums' are used in monitoring to periodically scan critical files for changes. Cryptographic checksums are calculated for these files and compared against a record of known good values. Any discrepancy indicates that a file has been modified, potentially by an attacker or due to system corruption, serving as a key mechanism for intrusion detection."
"What is 'Registry access' monitoring, and to which operating system is it specific?","'Registry access' monitoring involves tracking access to the system registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems, where the registry is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system and applications. Monitoring registry access helps detect unauthorized modifications or suspicious activity related to system configuration."
What does 'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provide insight into?,"'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies. The kernel is the core of the operating system, and drivers are software components that allow the OS to interact with hardware. Monitoring these low-level components can reveal sophisticated attacks or system malfunctions that operate beneath the application layer, offering a deeper understanding of system integrity."
What can 'Resource usage' monitoring indicate?,"'Resource usage' monitoring, which tracks CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. Unusual spikes or patterns in resource consumption might suggest that a system is under attack, running unauthorized processes, or experiencing a denial-of-service attempt, making it a valuable indicator for security and performance diagnostics."
What do 'Network activities' include in the context of monitored data?,"In the context of monitored data, 'Network activities' include established connections and received packets. Monitoring network activities allows for the detection of unauthorized communication, data exfiltration, or attempts to exploit network vulnerabilities, providing crucial insights into the system's external interactions and potential threats."
What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. Its primary function is to monitor network or host activities for suspicious patterns or violations of security policies, alerting administrators to potential threats or ongoing attacks."
How can an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) be implemented?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be implemented at different layers within a computing environment. This includes network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitors network traffic, and host-based IDS (HIDS), which monitors the characteristics and activities of a single host for suspicious activities."
"What is a host-based IDS, and what does it monitor?","A host-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a type of IDS that focuses on monitoring the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. Unlike network-based IDSs that monitor network traffic, a host-based IDS examines system logs, file integrity, running processes, and other host-specific data to detect intrusions or malicious behavior on that particular machine."
What are the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components:
1.  **Sensors**: Responsible for collecting data from the monitored environment.
2.  **Analyzers**: Responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred, identifying possible evidence, and potentially providing guidance on actions to take.
3.  **User interface**: Enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system."
What is the role of 'Sensors' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"The role of 'Sensors' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is to collect data. These sensors are deployed in the monitored environment (e.g., on a host or network segment) to gather relevant information, such as system logs, network packets, file access attempts, or process activities, which is then fed to the analyzers for detection."
What is the role of 'Analyzers' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"The role of 'Analyzers' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is critical for determining if an intrusion has occurred. They process the data collected by the sensors, apply detection rules or algorithms, and identify possible evidence of an intrusion. Analyzers may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the detected intrusion, such as generating alerts or initiating countermeasures."
What is the role of the 'User interface' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"The role of the 'User interface' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is to enable a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. This interface typically presents alerts, reports, and configuration options, allowing security personnel to monitor the system's status, respond to incidents, and manage the IDS effectively."
