Explain the concept of a Capability List (C-List) and its primary function.,A Capability List (C-List) specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user. Its primary function is to be convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user.
"How can an access control matrix be implemented using decomposition by rows, and what role does a C-List play in this implementation?","In practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse and can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways, one of which is decomposition by rows. A C-List plays a role in this by specifying authorized objects and operations for a particular user, making it convenient for determining the access rights available to a specific user."
What are the characteristics of an access control matrix that lead to its implementation via decomposition?,"An access control matrix is usually sparse, which means it contains many empty or null entries. This characteristic leads to its implementation by decomposition, often by rows, to manage access control efficiently."
Define what constitutes 'resources' in the context of Unix OS resource management.,"In the context of Unix OS resource management, 'resources' are uniformly treated entities that include files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices. These resources are the objects of access control."
Describe the ownership structure of resources in a Unix OS.,"In a Unix OS, each resource has a single user owner and a group owner. These owners are responsible for controlling access to their respective resources."
List the various file types identified in the Unix OS resource management example.,"The various file types identified in the Unix OS resource management example include: '-' for a regular file, 'd' for a directory, 's' for a socket, 'b' for a block device file, 'l' for a symbolic link, and 'c' for a character device file."
Explain the significance of the 'Link counter' in Unix OS resource management.,"The 'Link counter' in Unix OS resource management indicates the number of links, specifically directory entries, pointing to a particular file. This counter helps manage references to the file within the file system."
"What information is typically associated with a resource entry in a Unix OS, beyond its name and content?","Beyond its name and content, a resource entry in a Unix OS is typically associated with information such as its file type, file permissions (Read/write/execute), link counter (number of directory entries pointing to it), username of the owner, group name of the owner, file size, and modified date/time."
How are file permissions represented in the detailed resource listing shown in the Unix OS example?,"In the detailed resource listing shown in the Unix OS example, file permissions are represented by a string of characters like 'drwxrwxr-x' or '-rw-rw-r--'. These strings indicate the Read, Write, and Execute permissions for the owner, group, and others."
Identify the components of a Unix resource entry that specify ownership.,"The components of a Unix resource entry that specify ownership are the 'Username' and 'Group name'. The 'Username' indicates the single user owner, and the 'Group name' indicates the group owner of the resource."
Analyse the three fundamental permissions and the three subjects involved in permission representation.,"Permission representation involves three fundamental permissions and three subjects. The permissions are Read, Write, and Execute. The three subjects to whom these permissions apply are Owner, Group, and Other."
"Provide an example of a permission string that grants read and write access to the owner, and read access to the group and other users, and explain its components.","An example of such a permission string is 'rw-r--r--'. In this string, 'rw-' grants read and write access to the owner. The first 'r--' grants read access to the group, and the second 'r--' grants read access to other users. 'r' denotes Read, 'w' denotes Write, and '-' denotes no permission."
Explain the meaning of the permission string 'rwx------'.,"The permission string 'rwx------' means that the owner has read, write, and execute access. The group and other users have no rights whatsoever. 'r' denotes Read, 'w' denotes Write, and 'x' denotes Execute."
How is the permission string 'rw-r--r--' represented in octal notation?,"The permission string 'rw-r--r--' is represented in octal notation as 644. This corresponds to the binary representation 110 100 100. The permissions involved are Read, Write, and Execute, applied to the Owner, Group, and Other subjects."
What is the octal representation for the permission string 'rwx------'?,"The octal representation for the permission string 'rwx------' is 700. This corresponds to the binary representation 111 000 000. The permissions involved are Read, Write, and Execute, applied to the Owner, Group, and Other subjects."
"Describe how users can adjust file permissions in a Unix-like system, providing a command example.","Users can adjust file permissions using the `chmod` command. An example command is `chmod 754 filename`, which sets specific read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and other users. Another example is `chmod u+wrx,g+rx,g-w,o+r,o-wx filename`, which uses symbolic modes to modify permissions."
"Who has the authority to change the ownership of files in a Unix-like system, and what command is used for this purpose?","The root user has the authority to change the ownerships of files in a Unix-like system. The command used for this purpose is `chown`, with an example being `chown user:group filename`."
"What is Superuser privilege, and why is it required for certain OS functions?","Superuser privilege refers to elevated permissions required to execute certain OS functions. It is required because some operations, such as changing user passwords, involve accessing sensitive files like `/etc/shadow` which are owned by the root superuser and are not accessible to normal users."
Explain the role of the `/etc/shadow` file in password management and its ownership.,"The `/etc/shadow` file is where user passwords are stored. This file is owned by the root superuser, meaning a normal user has no direct access to it. It plays a critical role in securing user authentication information."
"Describe the process by which a normal user can change their password using the `passwd` program, considering access restrictions.","When a normal user wants to change their password with the `passwd` program, this program needs to be granted additional permissions to write to the `/etc/shadow` file. This is necessary because the `/etc/shadow` file, where user passwords are stored, is owned by the root superuser and is not directly accessible to normal users."
Define SUID and explain its primary function for a program.,"SUID, which stands for Set User ID, is a special permission flag for a program. Its primary function is that if SUID is enabled, the user who executes this program will inherit the permissions of the program's owner."
"How does the SUID flag enable a normal user to perform actions requiring root permissions, using the `passwd` program as an example?","The SUID flag enables a normal user to perform actions requiring root permissions by allowing the user to inherit the program owner's permissions when executing the program. For example, a normal user executing the `passwd` program, which typically has the SUID flag set and is owned by root, can gain additional root permission to write the new password to the `/etc/shadow` file, even though `/etc/shadow` is normally inaccessible to them."
How is the execute permission of the owner represented when the SUID flag is set?,"When the SUID flag is set, the execute permission of the owner is given as 's' instead of 'x'. This 's' indicates that the Set User ID bit is active for the owner's execute permission."
List other common SUID programs that are owned by root.,"Other common SUID programs that are owned by root include `/bin/login` for user login, `/bin/at` for batch job submission, and `/bin/su` for changing user ID."
Analyse the primary potential dangers associated with SUID programs.,"The primary potential dangers associated with SUID programs stem from the fact that the user executing the program gains the program owner's privileges. This means the program should strictly adhere to the owner's intended actions. A significant danger is that an attacker could exploit a SUID program owned by root by tricking it into performing unintended actions, thereby allowing the attacker to act as the root user."
What are the key security considerations for managing SUID programs?,"The key security considerations for managing SUID programs include: \n1. All user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, must be processed with extreme care. \n2. Programs should only be granted SUID status if it is absolutely necessary. \n3. The integrity of SUID programs must be continuously monitored to prevent tampering or exploitation."
Why is careful processing of user input crucial for SUID programs?,"Careful processing of user input, including command line arguments and environment variables, is crucial for SUID programs because a user running a SUID program inherits the program owner's privileges. Malicious input could potentially trick the SUID program into performing unintended actions, allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges, such as acting as the root user."
Under what circumstances should a program be granted SUID status?,"A program should be granted SUID status only if it is really necessary. This is a critical security consideration because granting SUID status allows the user executing the program to inherit the program owner's privileges, which can be exploited if not carefully managed."
What is the importance of monitoring the integrity of SUID programs?,"Monitoring the integrity of SUID programs is important because these programs run with elevated privileges (those of their owner). Ensuring their integrity helps prevent attackers from modifying them to perform unintended actions, which could lead to unauthorized access or system compromise."
"What are the main purposes of implementing logging, monitoring, and auditing in a system?","The main purposes of implementing logging, monitoring, and auditing in a system are: \n1. **Intrusion detection:** To identify unauthorized access or system changes. \n2. **Forensics and investigation:** To provide historical data for incident response. \n3. **Accountability:** To track user actions and commands. \n4. **Performance monitoring:** To assist in debugging applications and diagnosing issues."

By collecting and analyzing performance-related data, system administrators and developers can identify bottlenecks, errors, and other operational problems."
"Analyse the key challenges associated with logging, monitoring, and auditing.","The key challenges associated with logging, monitoring, and auditing include: \n1. **High storage and processing requirements:** There is a need to precisely select and record only the most critical data to manage these demands. \n2. **Risk of log tampering:** Attackers may erase or modify logs, necessitating robust protection mechanisms like encryption and access control. \n3. **Compromise of user privacy:** It is crucial to follow compliance and retention policies to prevent unauthorized disclosure of user information."
"Why do logging, monitoring, and auditing activities often face high storage and processing requirements?","Logging, monitoring, and auditing activities often face high storage and processing requirements because they involve collecting and analyzing potentially vast amounts of data. To mitigate this, it is necessary to precisely select and record only the most critical data."
What security measures are recommended to protect logs from being erased or modified by attackers?,"To protect logs from being erased or modified by attackers, it is recommended to well protect the data through measures such as encryption and access control. These measures help ensure the integrity and authenticity of the log records."
"How can logging, monitoring, and auditing potentially compromise user privacy, and what is the recommended approach to address this?","Logging, monitoring, and auditing can potentially compromise user privacy by collecting and storing detailed information about user activities. The recommended approach to address this is to follow the compliance and retention policies, ensuring that data collection and storage practices adhere to privacy regulations and guidelines."
What types of data does the OS collect at different layers for monitoring purposes?,"The OS collects different types of data at different layers for monitoring purposes, including System call traces, Log files, File integrity checksums, Registry access information, Kernel and driver-level monitoring data, Resource usage statistics, and Network activities."
Define 'System call traces' as a type of monitored data.,'System call traces' describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. This type of monitored data provides insight into how programs interact with the operating system kernel.
What kind of information is captured in a 'Log file' for monitoring purposes?,"A 'Log file' captures information on user activity, including user login records, history of commands, and other system events. This data is crucial for auditing and troubleshooting."
Explain the function of 'File integrity checksums' in monitoring and security.,'File integrity checksums' function by periodically scanning critical files for changes and comparing cryptographic checksums for these files with a record of known good values. This helps detect unauthorized modifications to important system files.
"What does 'Registry access' monitoring entail, and to which operating system is it specific?",'Registry access' monitoring entails observing access to the system registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems and helps detect unauthorized modifications to system configurations.
Describe the insights provided by 'Kernel and driver-level monitoring'.,'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies. This data source is critical for detecting low-level system compromises or malfunctions that might not be visible at higher application layers.
How can 'Resource usage' data indicate malicious behaviors?,"'Resource usage' data, which includes CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. Unusual spikes or patterns in resource consumption might suggest the presence of malware or unauthorized processes."
What information is included in 'Network activities' as a type of monitored data?,"'Network activities' as a type of monitored data include established connections and received packets. This information is vital for detecting suspicious network communications, unauthorized data transfers, or network-based attacks."
Define an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and its primary purpose.,An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. Its primary purpose is to identify and alert about suspicious activities that may indicate a security breach.
Differentiate between network-based IDS and host-based IDS.,"IDS can be implemented at different layers. Network-based IDS monitors network traffic for intrusions, while host-based IDS monitors the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. The document primarily focuses on host-based IDS."
List and describe the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: \n1. **Sensors:** These are responsible for collecting data from the monitored environment. \n2. **Analyzers:** These components are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred, identifying possible evidence, and potentially providing guidance on actions to take as a result of the intrusion. \n3. **User interface:** This enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system."
Explain the function of the 'Analyzers' component within an IDS.,The 'Analyzers' component within an IDS is responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred. It also identifies the possible evidence related to the intrusion and may provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion.
