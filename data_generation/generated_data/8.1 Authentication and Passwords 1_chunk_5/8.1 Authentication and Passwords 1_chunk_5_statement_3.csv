Define OTP cards and explain their primary function.,"OTP cards, which stands for One-Time Password cards, are a type of security product that generates a new password each time a user logs in. Their primary function is to enhance security by ensuring that a password is only valid for a single login session."
What is the SecurID card and how does it work?,"The SecurID card, a product by RSA Security, is a device that functions as an OTP card. It displays a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user needs to log into a computer system, they enter the number shown on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
Explain the server's role in the SecurID card authentication process.,"The server plays a crucial role in the SecurID card authentication process. It possesses the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to verify the password that the user enters, ensuring that it matches the one generated by the card."
Describe variations of OTP systems.,"Besides the SecurID card, other variations of OTP systems exist. Some OTP systems generate passwords for users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. Additionally, while OTP systems traditionally required users to carry separate devices, they are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
How do some OTP systems generate passwords based on user input?,"In some OTP systems, passwords are generated for users exclusively when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This means the PIN acts as a trigger or a component in the password generation process for these specific OTP implementations."
What is the trend regarding the integration of OTP systems?,"Traditionally, OTP systems necessitated users carrying additional, separate devices. However, there is a trend towards integrating these OTP functionalities into devices that users already possess, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
Define smart cards and explain their tamper-resistant nature.,"Smart cards are a type of card that contains a microprocessor and other components, making them 'smart'. New generation smart cards are designed to be tamper-resistant. This means that if an unauthorized person attempts to open the card or access the information stored on it, the internal circuitry is designed to self-destruct, thereby protecting the data."
Describe the internal construction of a smart card.,"The 'smart' aspect of a smart card is due to its internal components, which include a microprocessor, memory, and other elements. These components are typically epoxied or glued together. This construction method makes it difficult to take the card apart without causing damage, thus preventing easy access to the internal workings."
Explain the authentication process involving a smart card and a reader.,"The authentication process with a smart card begins when the smart card issues a ""challenge"" to a reader. The user is then required to enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) into the reader. The reader computes a response to the challenge based on the entered PIN. If the smart card receives this correct response, the user is considered authenticated, and access to the secret information stored on the smart card is granted."
What is a key vulnerability when using smart cards for authentication?,"A significant vulnerability in using smart cards for authentication is that the smart card reader, which is where the user enters their PIN, must be trusted. If the reader is compromised, it can lead to security breaches."
Describe the threat posed by a rogue smart card reader.,"A rogue smart card reader, which is a reader installed by an attacker, can record a user's PIN. If the attacker subsequently gains possession of the smart card itself, they can use the recorded PIN to authenticate themselves to the smart card as if they were the legitimate user, thereby compromising the system."
Is the attack involving a rogue smart card reader feasible?,"Yes, an attack involving a rogue smart card reader is considered feasible. While it might sound like it requires a significant level of control on the part of the attacker, the described scenario of recording a PIN and then using a compromised smart card is achievable."
