A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (like a passphrase) into a fixed-length output, which serves as the actual password."
Where are Visual Drawing Patterns typically used?,"Visual drawing patterns are typically used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android operating systems."
Which operating system is known for using Picture Passwords?,Picture passwords were used in Windows 8.
Describe the concept of a Passphrase.,"A Passphrase is an alternative password form where users input sentences or long phrases that are easy for them to recall. The system then processes these phrases using a hash function to generate a fixed-size actual password. A hash function is a one-way mathematical process that transforms an input into a fixed-length output, ensuring that the original input cannot be easily reconstructed from the output."
What is the primary interface for Visual Drawing Patterns?,The primary interface for Visual Drawing Patterns is a touch interface.
How do Picture Passwords work?,Picture passwords work by requiring the user to select specific objects within pictures and patterns displayed on the screen for authentication.
Summarise the purpose and potential threats to a password file.,"An operating system maintains a password file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. The primary threat to this file is an attacker attempting to compromise its confidentiality or integrity. Confidentiality refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, while integrity refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data."
What are the main options for protecting a password file?,"The main options for protecting a password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, or a combination of both cryptographic protection and access control. Further measures can also be implemented to slow down dictionary attacks."
Explain cryptographic protection for password files.,"Cryptographic protection involves using encryption techniques to secure the password file. Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access, while decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form."
Describe access control as a method for protecting password files.,"Access control enforced by the operating system is a method for protecting password files. It involves restricting who can read, write, or execute the password file, thereby preventing unauthorized users or processes from accessing or modifying it. The operating system manages these permissions."
What is a dictionary attack and how can it be mitigated in password file protection?,"A dictionary attack is a method of attempting to break into a password-protected computer system or service by systematically trying every word in a dictionary as a password. When protecting a password file, a combination of cryptographic protection and access control can be used, possibly with further measures specifically designed to slow down such dictionary attacks, making them impractical."
What information does the operating system's password file contain?,The operating system's password file contains user names and their associated passwords.
What does it mean to compromise the confidentiality of a password file?,"To compromise the confidentiality of a password file means that an unauthorized party gains access to the sensitive information within it, specifically the user names and passwords. Confidentiality, in this context, refers to ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access."
What does it mean to compromise the integrity of a password file?,"To compromise the integrity of a password file means that an unauthorized party has altered or corrupted the data within it, such as changing user names or passwords. Integrity, in this context, refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, ensuring it has not been modified without authorization."
Can you summarise the combined approach to protecting password files?,"A combined approach to protecting password files involves utilizing both cryptographic protection and access control. This method may also include additional measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks, enhancing overall security. Cryptographic protection uses encryption to secure data, while access control restricts who can interact with the file."
Why is it important to protect the password file?,"It is important to protect the password file because it contains sensitive user names and passwords. An attacker could try to compromise its confidentiality, meaning gaining unauthorized access to the information, or its integrity, meaning altering the data, which could lead to unauthorized system access or other security breaches."
Summarise the importance of restricting write access to the password file.,"Restricting write access to the password file to only privileged users is crucial. If an attacker gains write access, they could change the passwords of other users, even if those passwords are protected by cryptographic means. Privileged users are those with elevated permissions, typically administrators, who have the authority to manage system resources."
Under what conditions could passwords theoretically be stored unencrypted?,"Passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted if read access to the password file is strictly restricted to only privileged users. This means that only authorized administrators or system processes would be able to view the file's contents, reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure. Unencrypted data is data that is not protected by cryptographic algorithms."
What happens if a password file contains data required by unprivileged users?,"If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, then the passwords within it must be 'encrypted'. However, even with this encryption, such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks. Unprivileged users are standard users with limited system permissions, while 'encrypted' here refers to a form of protection, though potentially vulnerable."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems secure the actual password file?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems secure the actual password file by hiding it in a location like \/etc\/shadow. This directory is not accessible to non-privileged users, thereby preventing unauthorized access to the sensitive password data. Non-privileged users are standard users without administrative rights."
"What is the risk if non-privileged users have access to the password file, even if passwords are 'encrypted'?","If a password file, even with 'encrypted' passwords, is accessible to unprivileged users, it can still be used in dictionary attacks. This means that an attacker could systematically try common words or phrases against the 'encrypted' passwords to deduce the actual passwords, despite the encryption. Unprivileged users are those without administrative rights."
Define 'privileged users' in the context of password file access.,"In the context of password file access, 'privileged users' are those who have elevated permissions, specifically write access, to the password file. This restriction is in place to prevent unauthorized individuals from altering other users' passwords, even if cryptographic protection is present."
Why is cryptographic protection alone not sufficient if an attacker gains write access to the password file?,"Cryptographic protection alone is not sufficient if an attacker gains write access to the password file because the attacker could simply change the passwords of other users. Even if the original passwords were cryptographically protected, the attacker could overwrite them with new, known passwords, thereby gaining unauthorized access."
What is the primary benefit of restricting read access to the password file to privileged users?,"The primary benefit of restricting read access to the password file to privileged users is that, in theory, passwords could then be stored unencrypted. This is because only trusted individuals or processes would be able to view the file's contents, minimizing the risk of unauthorized disclosure of plain-text passwords."
Where is the actual password file typically located in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix\/Linux systems, the actual password file is typically hidden in \/etc\/shadow."
What is the purpose of hiding the password file in \/etc\/shadow?,"The purpose of hiding the password file in \/etc\/shadow is to make it inaccessible to non-privileged users. This prevents unauthorized individuals from reading or tampering with the sensitive password information, enhancing the security of the system."
Summarise the process by which biometric authentication determines user acceptance.,"Biometric authentication determines user acceptance by measuring the similarity between reference features and current features. A user is accepted if this measured similarity is above a predefined threshold. Reference features are the stored biometric data of an authorized user, while current features are the biometric data presented during an authentication attempt."
Define and explain the implications of a 'False Positive' in biometric authentication.,A 'False Positive' in biometric authentication occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user. This constitutes a significant security problem because an unauthorized individual gains access to the system or resource. A wrong user is someone who is not the legitimate account holder.
Define and explain the implications of a 'False Negative' in biometric authentication.,"A 'False Negative' in biometric authentication occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. This creates embarrassment for the user and leads to an inefficient work environment, as the authorized individual is denied access. A legitimate user is the rightful account holder attempting to authenticate."
What is a 'predefined threshold' in biometric authentication?,"A 'predefined threshold' in biometric authentication is a specific level of similarity that must be met or exceeded between the current biometric features and the stored reference features for a user to be accepted. If the similarity score falls below this threshold, the user is rejected."
What are the two main types of failure rates in biometric authentication?,The two main types of failure rates in biometric authentication are False Positive and False Negative.
How does the system measure similarity in biometric authentication?,The system measures similarity in biometric authentication by comparing the current features presented by the user with the stored reference features. This comparison quantifies how alike the two sets of features are.
What is the consequence of a False Positive?,"The consequence of a False Positive is a security problem, as it means a wrong user has been accepted by the system."
What is the consequence of a False Negative?,The consequence of a False Negative is that it creates embarrassment for the legitimate user and leads to an inefficient work environment because the authorized user is rejected.
When is a user accepted in biometric authentication?,A user is accepted in biometric authentication if the measured similarity between their current features and the reference features is above a predefined threshold.
What is the 'new issue' discussed regarding failure rates?,"The 'new issue' discussed regarding failure rates refers to the occurrence of False Positives and False Negatives in authentication systems, particularly in biometrics."
Summarise the nature of fingerprints and biometric traits regarding their secrecy.,"Fingerprints and biometric traits, while generally unique, are described as 'no secrets'. This means that despite their uniqueness, they are not inherently private or secure, as demonstrated by instances where they can be lifted or replicated."
Provide examples of how hackers have compromised fingerprint systems.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s. Similar attacks were also applicable to the Samsung S5 phone, indicating a vulnerability in commercial fingerprint recognition systems."
Explain the concept of 'Rubber Fingers' and their impact on fingerprint recognition systems.,'Rubber fingers' refer to fabricated replicas of fingerprints that have successfully defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems in the past. This highlights a significant vulnerability where physical impersonation can bypass biometric security.
What is the impact of 'Rubber Fingers' when security personnel are present?,"If authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel, the issue of 'rubber fingers' becomes a minor one. Security personnel can observe and intervene, making it harder for an attacker to use a forged fingerprint undetected."
What additional precautions are needed when authenticating remote users with fingerprint systems?,"When authenticating remote users, additional precautions must be taken to counteract the fraud associated with 'rubber fingers'. This implies that remote authentication lacks the physical oversight of security personnel, necessitating other security measures to verify identity."
Why is secure storage of biometric data important?,"Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement from the angle of personal privacy protection. Biometric data, being unique and tied to an individual, requires robust protection to prevent misuse or unauthorized access, which could have significant privacy implications."
Are fingerprints considered secrets?,"No, fingerprints are generally unique but are explicitly stated to be 'no secrets', implying they are not inherently private or secure against replication or lifting."
What specific phone models were mentioned in relation to fingerprint lifting attacks?,The specific phone models mentioned in relation to fingerprint lifting attacks were the iPhone 5s and the Samsung S5 phone.
What is the main challenge posed by 'Rubber Fingers'?,"The main challenge posed by 'Rubber Fingers' is their ability to defeat many commercial fingerprint recognition systems, allowing unauthorized access through physical impersonation."
What is the primary concern regarding biometric data from a privacy perspective?,"The primary concern regarding biometric data from a privacy perspective is the need for its secure storage. This is crucial for protecting personal privacy, as biometric data is unique to an individual and its compromise could lead to significant privacy breaches."
