Compare Passphrase with Visual drawing patterns as alternative forms of password.,"A Passphrase involves a user entering sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, and the system applies a hash function to compute the (fixed-size) actual passwords. In contrast, Visual drawing patterns are used on touch interfaces, such as in Android, where a user draws a specific pattern."
What are the differences between Picture passwords and One-time passwords?,"Picture passwords require the user to select objects in pictures and patterns, as seen in Windows 8. One-time passwords, on the other hand, are temporary passwords valid for a single login session or transaction."
Compare cryptographic protection with access control as methods for protecting the password file.,"Cryptographic protection involves using encryption or hashing to secure the password file, making its contents unreadable without the correct key or difficult to reverse engineer. Access control, enforced by the operating system, restricts who can read, write, or execute the password file, thereby limiting unauthorized access."
What is the difference between a False Positive and a False Negative in the context of authentication failure rates?,"A False Positive occurs when the system accepts a wrong user, which constitutes a security problem. Conversely, a False Negative happens when the system rejects a legitimate user, leading to embarrassment and an inefficient work environment. In both cases, the system measures similarity between reference features and current features, accepting a user if the match is above a predefined threshold."
Compare the general vulnerability of fingerprints with the specific threat of rubber fingers.,"In general, fingerprints and biometric traits, while unique, are ""no secrets"" and can be lifted, as demonstrated by hackers lifting fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s and Samsung S5. Rubber fingers represent a specific type of fraud where artificial replicas of fingerprints are used. These have defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems in the past. While a minor issue if authentication occurs in the presence of security personnel, additional precautions are necessary when authenticating remote users to counteract this type of fraud."
Explain the importance of restricting write access versus read access to the password file.,"Restricting write access to the password file means that only privileged users can modify it. This is crucial because an attacker could gain access to other users' data by simply changing their password if write access is not properly controlled, even if the file is cryptographically protected. Restricting read access to privileged users means that only authorized users can view the contents of the password file. If read access is sufficiently restricted, passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted. However, if the password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted,"" though such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks. Modern Unix/Linux systems address this by hiding the actual password file in /etc/shadow, making it inaccessible to non-privileged users."
Compare Passphrase and Picture passwords as alternative authentication methods.,"A Passphrase involves a user entering sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, which the system then processes using a hash function to compute fixed-size actual passwords. Picture passwords, on the other hand, require users to select specific objects within pictures and patterns, a method used in systems like Windows 8."
What are the differences between Visual drawing patterns and Picture passwords?,"Visual drawing patterns are authentication methods used on touch interfaces, such as in Android, where a user draws a specific pattern. Picture passwords involve selecting objects in pictures and patterns, a method utilized in Windows 8."
Compare Passphrase with One-time passwords.,"A Passphrase is an authentication method where a user inputs sentences or long phrases that are easy to recall, and the system uses a hash function to derive fixed-size actual passwords. One-time passwords are temporary passwords that are valid for a single use or a limited period."
What are the differences between Visual drawing patterns and One-time passwords?,"Visual drawing patterns are an authentication method primarily used on touch interfaces, such as in Android, where a user authenticates by drawing a specific pattern. One-time passwords are temporary passwords designed for a single use or a limited duration."
Compare Picture passwords and Passphrase.,"Picture passwords are an authentication method where users select objects in pictures and patterns, as exemplified in Windows 8. A Passphrase, conversely, involves users entering sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, with the system applying a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size passwords."
Compare cryptographic protection alone with a combination of cryptographic protection and access control for password file security.,"Cryptographic protection involves securing the password file through encryption or hashing. A combination of cryptographic protection and access control provides a more robust defense. This combined approach not only encrypts or hashes the password data but also enforces operating system-level restrictions on who can access the file. Additionally, the combined approach may include further measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks, enhancing overall security."
What are the differences between access control enforced by the operating system and a combination of cryptographic protection and access control for protecting the password file?,"Access control enforced by the operating system restricts who can interact with the password file (e.g., read, write permissions). A combination of cryptographic protection and access control integrates this operating system-level access restriction with cryptographic measures, such as encryption or hashing, to protect the file's contents. The combined approach also potentially includes additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks, offering a more comprehensive security strategy."
Compare the concepts of confidentiality and integrity in the context of a password file.,"Confidentiality, in the context of a password file, refers to protecting the file's contents from unauthorized disclosure. An attacker compromising confidentiality would be able to read usernames and passwords. Integrity, on the other hand, refers to protecting the password file from unauthorized modification or alteration. An attacker compromising integrity could change passwords or user data within the file. Both are critical aspects that an attacker might try to compromise."
Compare the access control considerations for password files containing data for privileged users versus unprivileged users.,"For password files, only privileged users must have write access to prevent attackers from changing other users' passwords. If read access is restricted solely to privileged users, passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted. However, if the password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted,"" and modern Unix/Linux systems hide the actual password file in /etc/shadow, making it inaccessible to non-privileged users."
How does a modern Unix/Linux system differentiate password file access for privileged versus non-privileged users?,"In a modern Unix/Linux system, the actual password file is hidden in /etc/shadow. This file is specifically designed to be not accessible to non-privileged users. This restriction ensures that even if unprivileged users need some password-related data, the sensitive actual password information remains protected from them, while privileged users retain the necessary access."
Compare the consequences of a False Positive versus a False Negative in authentication.,"A False Positive, where a wrong user is accepted, creates a security problem because unauthorized individuals gain access. A False Negative, where a legitimate user is rejected, leads to embarrassment for the user and an inefficient work environment due as authorized individuals are denied access."
"Compare the idea of fingerprints being unique with the statement that they are ""no secrets.""","Fingerprints and biometric traits are generally considered unique to an individual. However, despite their uniqueness, they are described as ""no secrets"" because they can be lifted or replicated. For example, hackers demonstrated in September 2013 how to lift fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s, with similar attacks applying to Samsung S5 phones, indicating that their uniqueness does not guarantee their secrecy or invulnerability to fraud."
Compare the threat of rubber fingers when security personnel are present versus when authenticating remote users.,"The issue of rubber fingers, which have defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems, is considered a minor problem if authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel. This implies that human oversight can mitigate the risk. However, when authenticating remote users, additional precautions must be taken to counteract this type of fraud, as the direct presence of security personnel is absent, increasing vulnerability."
Compare how a Passphrase is processed by the system with how a password file might be generally protected cryptographically.,"For a Passphrase, the system applies a hash function to compute the fixed-size actual passwords from the user's input sentences or long phrases. Hashing is a one-way process that creates a fixed-size output from variable-size input. In contrast, cryptographic protection for a password file can involve either hashing or encryption. Encryption is a two-way process where data is transformed into ciphertext and can be reverted to plaintext with a key, while hashing is primarily used for integrity checks and storing password representations. The document specifically mentions ""cryptographic protection"" for the password file, which could encompass both, but for passphrases, it explicitly states a ""hash function."""
Compare the implementation of visual authentication in Android versus Windows 8.,"Android utilizes Visual drawing patterns, which are implemented on touch interfaces where users draw a specific pattern for authentication. Windows 8, on the other hand, uses Picture passwords, where users select objects in pictures and patterns for authentication."
Compare cryptographic protection of a password file with measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks.,"Cryptographic protection involves using encryption or hashing to secure the password file's contents, making them unreadable or difficult to reverse without authorization. Measures to slow down dictionary attacks are additional safeguards, often used in combination with cryptographic protection and access control. These measures are specifically designed to increase the time and computational effort required for an attacker to guess passwords using a dictionary of common words or phrases, thereby making such attacks less feasible."
What is the difference between compromising the confidentiality and compromising the integrity of a password file?,Compromising the confidentiality of a password file means an attacker gains unauthorized access to read the usernames and passwords stored within it. Compromising the integrity of a password file means an attacker gains unauthorized ability to modify or alter the usernames and passwords or other data within the file. Both are critical threats to the password file.
Compare Passphrase authentication with authentication using biometric traits.,"Passphrase authentication involves a user entering sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, with the system applying a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size passwords. Biometric traits, such as fingerprints, are physical or behavioral characteristics used for authentication. While generally unique, biometric traits are ""no secrets"" and can be lifted or forged, as demonstrated by attacks on fingerprint systems."
Compare the general concept of protecting a password file with the secure storage of biometric data.,"Protecting the password file involves safeguarding a file maintained by the operating system that contains usernames and passwords. This protection can include cryptographic measures, access control, or a combination of both, possibly with additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks, to prevent compromise of confidentiality or integrity. Secure storage of biometric data, such as fingerprints, is an important requirement from the angle of personal privacy protection, ensuring that sensitive biometric information is protected from unauthorized access or misuse."
Compare the access rights of privileged users for writing to the password file with the access rights of unprivileged users to password file data.,"Only privileged users must have write access to the password file to prevent attackers from changing other users' passwords. Conversely, unprivileged users should not have direct access to the actual password file. If password file data is required by unprivileged users, it must be ""encrypted,"" and modern Unix/Linux systems hide the actual password file in /etc/shadow to make it inaccessible to non-privileged users."
Compare the user's role in remembering a Passphrase with the system's role in processing it.,"For a Passphrase, the user's role is to enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system's role is to apply a hash function to this input to compute the fixed-size actual passwords, which are then stored or used for verification."
"Compare the concept of a ""predefined threshold"" in biometric authentication with the general idea of password strength.","In biometric authentication, a ""predefined threshold"" is a specific level of similarity between reference features and current features that must be met for a user to be accepted. If the match is above this threshold, the user is authenticated. Password strength, while not explicitly defined in the document, generally refers to the resistance of a password to guessing or brute-force attacks, often influenced by length, complexity, and randomness. The document focuses on the acceptance criteria for biometrics rather than the inherent strength of a password itself."
Compare the uniqueness of fingerprints with their vulnerability to being lifted.,"Fingerprints and biometric traits are generally unique to an individual. However, this uniqueness does not equate to invulnerability. Hackers have demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s and Samsung S5, indicating that despite their unique nature, they are susceptible to being compromised and replicated."
Compare the protection measures for ensuring the confidentiality of a password file versus its integrity.,"Protection measures for ensuring the confidentiality of a password file aim to prevent unauthorized reading of its contents, such as usernames and passwords. This can involve cryptographic protection. Protection measures for ensuring the integrity of a password file aim to prevent unauthorized modification or alteration of its contents. Both cryptographic protection and access control enforced by the operating system contribute to both confidentiality and integrity, with access control being particularly important for preventing unauthorized write access."
Compare Passphrase as an alternative form of password with traditional alphanumeric passwords.,"A Passphrase is an alternative form of password where the user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the fixed-size actual passwords. Traditional alphanumeric passwords, while not explicitly detailed, typically consist of a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, often with specific length and complexity requirements, and are generally shorter than passphrases. The key distinction is the length and memorability strategy."
Compare Visual drawing patterns as an authentication method with the general concept of touch interface usage.,"Visual drawing patterns are a specific authentication method that relies on a user drawing a pattern on a touch interface. The touch interface is the medium through which this authentication occurs, as seen in systems like Android. The pattern itself is the authentication credential, while the touch interface is the hardware component enabling its input."
Compare Picture passwords as implemented in Windows 8 with the general concept of selecting objects.,"Picture passwords, as used in Windows 8, are an authentication method where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns. The general concept of selecting objects refers to the action of choosing particular items from a visual display. In the context of Picture passwords, this general action is specifically applied as a security mechanism where the sequence and choice of objects serve as the password."
Compare One-time passwords with reusable passwords.,"One-time passwords are temporary passwords that are valid for a single login session or transaction. This means they cannot be reused. Reusable passwords, while not explicitly defined, are the common form of password that can be used multiple times for authentication until they are changed by the user or system."
Compare the role of the operating system in maintaining a password file with the user's role in generating passwords.,"The operating system maintains a file that stores user names and passwords, which is crucial for system security and user authentication. The user's role, on the other hand, involves generating or selecting their passwords, such as passphrases, visual drawing patterns, picture passwords, or one-time passwords, which are then processed and stored (or their hashed representations) within the password file by the system."
Compare cryptographic protection with dictionary attacks in the context of password file security.,"Cryptographic protection is a defense mechanism that uses encryption or hashing to secure the password file, making its contents unreadable or difficult to reverse without authorization. Dictionary attacks are a type of offensive measure where an attacker attempts to gain access by systematically trying common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords from a dictionary list. While cryptographic protection helps, additional measures may be needed to specifically slow down dictionary attacks, especially if the ""encrypted"" password file contains data accessible to unprivileged users."
Compare the implications of restricting write access versus restricting read access to the password file.,"Restricting write access to the password file means that only privileged users can modify it. This is critical because unauthorized write access could allow an attacker to change user passwords, thereby gaining access to other users' data. Restricting read access means that only privileged users can view the contents of the password file. If read access is sufficiently restricted, passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted. However, if unprivileged users need access to password-related data, passwords must be ""encrypted,"" even though such files can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks."
"Compare the ""encryption"" of password file data for unprivileged users with actual cryptographic encryption.","When the document states that if a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted,"" it implies a form of protection, likely hashing, that makes the passwords unreadable to unprivileged users. However, it also notes that ""such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks,"" suggesting that this ""encryption"" might refer to hashing or a reversible encryption that is still vulnerable. Actual cryptographic encryption, in a broader sense, would involve a robust, reversible process that makes data unintelligible without a key, and if properly implemented, would significantly resist dictionary attacks. The context suggests the term ""encrypted"" here might be used loosely to mean ""transformed"" or ""hashed."""
Compare the nature of the problem caused by a False Positive versus a False Negative in authentication.,"A False Positive in authentication is fundamentally a security problem because it results in an unauthorized individual being granted access, compromising the system's security. A False Negative, on the other hand, is primarily a user experience and efficiency problem, as it rejects a legitimate user, causing embarrassment and hindering productivity within the work environment."
Compare authentic fingerprints as biometric traits with rubber fingers.,"Authentic fingerprints are natural biometric traits that are generally unique to an individual and are used for identification and authentication. Rubber fingers, however, are fraudulent replicas of fingerprints. They represent a method of attack that has successfully defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems, highlighting the vulnerability of biometric systems to physical forgery."
Compare the secure storage of biometric data with the general concept of personal privacy protection.,"Secure storage of biometric data is a specific requirement for protecting sensitive personal information, such as fingerprints, from unauthorized access or misuse. This is an important requirement from the angle of personal privacy protection, which is a broader concept encompassing the protection of all types of personal data and the right of individuals to control their personal information."
Compare the type of input required for a Passphrase versus Visual drawing patterns.,"A Passphrase requires textual input, specifically sentences or long phrases that are easy for the user to remember. Visual drawing patterns, conversely, require gestural input on a touch interface, where the user draws a specific pattern."
Compare the user interaction for Picture passwords versus Visual drawing patterns.,Picture passwords involve user interaction by selecting objects in pictures and patterns. Visual drawing patterns involve user interaction by drawing a pattern on a touch interface.
Compare cryptographic protection with operating system enforcement in the context of password file security.,"Cryptographic protection involves using mathematical algorithms like hashing or encryption to secure the data within the password file itself, making it unintelligible without the proper key or difficult to reverse. Operating system enforcement, specifically access control, dictates who can access the password file and what actions they can perform (e.g., read, write), thereby controlling access at the system level rather than securing the data's content directly."
Compare dictionary attacks with general brute-force attacks in the context of password file security.,"Dictionary attacks are a type of attack where an attacker attempts to guess passwords by trying a predefined list of common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords. The document mentions ""measures to slow down dictionary attacks."" General brute-force attacks, while not explicitly defined, involve systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. Dictionary attacks are a subset of brute-force attacks, focusing on more probable guesses first."
Compare the specific method of hiding the password file in /etc/shadow in Unix/Linux with general access control principles.,"The specific method of modern Unix/Linux systems hiding the actual password file in /etc/shadow is an implementation of access control. It ensures that the file is not accessible to non-privileged users, thereby restricting read access to sensitive password data. General access control principles encompass a broader set of rules and mechanisms enforced by the operating system to regulate who or what can view or use resources, including files, based on permissions and user privileges."
Compare the outcome of accepting a wrong user with rejecting a legitimate user in an authentication system.,"Accepting a wrong user, which is a False Positive, results in a security breach where an unauthorized individual gains access to the system. Rejecting a legitimate user, which is a False Negative, results in an inconvenience for the authorized user, causing embarrassment and leading to an inefficient work environment due to denied access."
Compare the vulnerability of iPhone 5s fingerprints to lifting with that of Samsung S5 fingerprints.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s. The document states that similar attacks also apply to the Samsung S5 phone, indicating that both devices shared a comparable vulnerability to fingerprint lifting at that time."
Compare the security implications of rubber fingers in authentication when security personnel are present versus during remote authentication.,"The issue of rubber fingers is considered a minor problem if authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel, suggesting that human supervision can detect or deter such fraud. However, when authenticating remote users, additional precautions must be taken to counteract this type of fraud, as the lack of physical presence of security personnel increases the risk of successful attacks using rubber fingers."
Compare the primary cognitive process involved in using a Passphrase versus Picture passwords.,"Using a Passphrase primarily involves memory recall of sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. Picture passwords, on the other hand, primarily involve visual recognition and selection of specific objects within pictures and patterns."
