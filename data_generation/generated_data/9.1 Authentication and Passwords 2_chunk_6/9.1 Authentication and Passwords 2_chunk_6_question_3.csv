What are the alternative forms of password mentioned in the document?,"The document mentions four alternative forms of password: Passphrase, Visual drawing patterns, Picture passwords, and One-time passwords."
Define a passphrase as an alternative form of password.,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual passwords, which are fixed-size."
How does a system compute actual passwords from a passphrase?,"When a user enters a passphrase, which consists of sentences or long phrases, the system applies a hash function to compute the actual passwords. These actual passwords are of a fixed size."
What are visual drawing patterns in the context of alternative passwords?,Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password used on touch interfaces. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern.
Where are visual drawing patterns typically used for authentication?,"Visual drawing patterns are typically used on touch interfaces, for example, in Android operating systems, for user authentication."
Explain what picture passwords are and how they are used.,Picture passwords are an alternative form of password where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns for authentication. This method was used in Windows 8.
Which operating system is mentioned as using picture passwords?,"Windows 8 is mentioned as the operating system that used picture passwords, where users select objects in pictures and patterns for authentication."
What is a one-time password?,A one-time password is an alternative form of password that is valid for only a single login session or transaction.
Describe the mechanism behind a passphrase.,"The mechanism behind a passphrase involves a user inputting a memorable sentence or long phrase. Subsequently, the system processes this input using a hash function to generate a fixed-size actual password for authentication."
Provide an example of where visual drawing patterns are used for authentication.,"An example of where visual drawing patterns are used for authentication is on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android operating systems."
What is the purpose of a password file?,The operating system maintains a password file to store user names and their corresponding passwords. This file is essential for user authentication and system access control.
What potential risks does an attacker pose to a password file?,"An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the passwords, while compromising integrity means altering the password data."
List the options for protecting a password file.,"The options for protecting a password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, or a combination of both cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
Explain cryptographic protection for a password file.,"Cryptographic protection for a password file involves using encryption or hashing techniques to secure the data within the file. This makes the passwords unreadable or difficult to reverse-engineer without the proper decryption key or computational effort, even if an attacker gains access to the file."
How does access control enforced by the operating system protect a password file?,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects a password file by restricting who can read, write, or execute the file. This ensures that only authorized users or processes, typically privileged users, can interact with the sensitive password data."
Describe a combined approach to protecting a password file.,"A combined approach to protecting a password file involves utilizing both cryptographic protection and access control. This dual layer of security enhances the file's resilience against attacks, and can be further strengthened with measures designed to slow down dictionary attacks."
What additional measures can be taken with combined protection to enhance security?,"With combined cryptographic protection and access control, further measures can be implemented to slow down dictionary attacks. These measures make it more difficult and time-consuming for attackers to guess passwords by trying a large number of common words or phrases."
What is the primary concern regarding the confidentiality and integrity of a password file?,"The primary concern regarding a password file is that an attacker could compromise its confidentiality, meaning unauthorized access to the passwords, or its integrity, meaning unauthorized modification of the password data. Both can lead to severe security breaches."
What is a dictionary attack in the context of password file protection?,"A dictionary attack, in the context of password file protection, is an attempt by an attacker to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying a large number of common words, phrases, or pre-computed hashes (often from a 'dictionary') against the stored password data to find a match."
Why is protecting the password file crucial?,"Protecting the password file is crucial because it contains user names and passwords, making it a prime target for attackers. Compromising this file could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the system, undermining overall security and confidentiality."
Who should have write access to the password file?,Only privileged users must have write access to the password file. Restricting write access prevents unauthorized modification of password data.
What is the risk if non-privileged users have write access to the password file?,"If non-privileged users have write access to the password file, an attacker could gain access to the data of other users simply by changing their password. This risk exists even if the password file is protected by cryptographic means, as the attacker could overwrite the protected data."
Can passwords be stored unencrypted if read access is restricted to privileged users?,"Yes, if read access to the password file is strictly restricted to privileged users, then passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted. This is because only trusted entities would be able to view the file's contents."
What happens if a password file contains data required by unprivileged users?,"If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, the passwords within it must be ""encrypted."" However, even with encryption, such a file can still be vulnerable and used in dictionary attacks if the encryption is not robust or if the file itself is accessible."
What is a dictionary attack in the context of encrypted password files?,"In the context of encrypted password files, a dictionary attack involves an attacker attempting to decrypt or crack passwords by trying a large list of common words or phrases, even if the passwords are ""encrypted."" This can still be effective if the encryption or hashing method is weak or if the attacker has access to the encrypted hashes."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems handle the actual password file for security?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems enhance security by hiding the actual password file in a location like `/etc/shadow`. This file is specifically configured to be inaccessible to non-privileged users, thereby protecting sensitive password information."
What is the significance of `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems?,"The significance of `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems is that it serves as the secure location where the actual password file is hidden. It is designed to be inaccessible to non-privileged users, preventing them from viewing or modifying sensitive password data."
Why is it important to restrict write access to the password file to privileged users only?,"It is important to restrict write access to the password file to privileged users only because otherwise, an attacker could change other users' passwords, even if the file is cryptographically protected. This would grant the attacker unauthorized access to those user accounts."
What is the primary security measure for password files that contain data for unprivileged users?,"The primary security measure for password files that contain data required by unprivileged users is that the passwords must be ""encrypted."" This helps protect the sensitive information, although such files can still be susceptible to dictionary attacks."
"Explain the concept of ""privileged users"" in the context of password file access.","In the context of password file access, ""privileged users"" refer to specific users or system accounts that have elevated permissions. These permissions allow them to perform sensitive operations, such as having write access to the password file, which is typically restricted to prevent unauthorized modifications."
How is a user accepted in a system that measures similarity between features?,"In a system that measures similarity between reference features and current features, a user is accepted if the match between these features is above a predefined threshold. This threshold determines the acceptable level of similarity for authentication."
"What is a ""predefined threshold"" in user acceptance?","A ""predefined threshold"" in user acceptance refers to a specific value or limit that must be met or exceeded for a user to be authenticated. If the measured similarity between a user's current features and their reference features is above this threshold, the user is accepted."
Define a False Positive in the context of user authentication.,"A False Positive in the context of user authentication occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user. This means an unauthorized individual is granted access, posing a significant security problem."
What is the consequence of a False Positive in an authentication system?,"The consequence of a False Positive in an authentication system is a security problem, as it means the system accepts a wrong, unauthorized user, thereby granting them access to resources they should not have."
Define a False Negative in the context of user authentication.,"A False Negative in the context of user authentication occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. This means an authorized individual is denied access, which creates embarrassment and an inefficient work environment."
What are the consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system?,"The consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system are that it rejects a legitimate user, leading to embarrassment for the user and creating an inefficient work environment due to denied access."
What are the two main issues related to failure rates in authentication systems?,"The two main issues related to failure rates in authentication systems are False Positives and False Negatives. A False Positive accepts a wrong user, creating a security problem, while a False Negative rejects a legitimate user, causing embarrassment and inefficiency."
How is user acceptance determined based on reference and current features?,"User acceptance is determined by measuring the similarity between reference features and current features. If this measured similarity is above a predefined threshold, the user is accepted by the system."
Are fingerprints and biometric traits truly unique and secret?,"While fingerprints and biometric traits may be unique in general, they are not considered secrets. This implies that they can potentially be replicated or acquired by unauthorized parties."
What evidence suggests that fingerprints are not entirely secret?,"Evidence suggesting fingerprints are not entirely secret includes instances where hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s in September 2013, with similar attacks also applicable to phones like the Samsung S5."
Describe the hacker attack on iPhone 5s fingerprints in September 2013.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s.
