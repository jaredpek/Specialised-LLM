What potential risks does an attacker pose to the password file?,An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file.
List the options for protecting the password file.,"The options for protecting the password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, and a combination of cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
Define 'cryptographic protection' in the context of password file security.,"Cryptographic protection is one of the options for securing the password file, involving the use of encryption or other cryptographic techniques to safeguard the data within the file."
Explain 'access control enforced by the operating system' as a protection measure for password files.,"Access control enforced by the operating system is a protection measure for password files where the operating system regulates who can access the file and what operations they can perform on it, such as reading or writing."
What is a 'dictionary attack' and how can it be mitigated in password file protection?,"A dictionary attack is a method an attacker might use to compromise passwords. It can be mitigated in password file protection by implementing a combination of cryptographic protection and access control, along with further measures specifically designed to slow down such attacks."
Why is it important to protect the password file?,"It is important to protect the password file because it contains sensitive user names and passwords, and an attacker could compromise its confidentiality or integrity."
"Can a combination of protection methods be used for password files? If so, what does it involve?","Yes, a combination of protection methods can be used for password files. This involves combining cryptographic protection and access control, potentially with additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
What two aspects of the password file could an attacker compromise?,An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file.
What is the fundamental purpose of the password file maintained by the operating system?,The fundamental purpose of the password file maintained by the operating system is to store user names and passwords.
Who should have write access to the password file according to access control settings?,"According to access control settings, only privileged users must have write access to the password file."
What is the risk if non-privileged users have write access to the password file?,"If non-privileged users have write access to the password file, an attacker could gain access to the data of other users simply by changing their password, even if the file is protected by cryptographic means."
Under what condition could passwords theoretically be stored unencrypted?,Passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted if read access to the password file is restricted solely to privileged users.
"If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, what protection is necessary for passwords, and what is a potential vulnerability?","If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted"". However, even with encryption, such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems address the accessibility of the actual password file for non-privileged users?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems address the accessibility of the actual password file for non-privileged users by hiding it in /etc/shadow, which is not accessible to non-privileged users."
Why is restricting write access to the password file to privileged users crucial?,"Restricting write access to the password file to privileged users is crucial because otherwise, an attacker could gain access to other users' data by changing their passwords, even if cryptographic protection is in place."
What is the implication of a password file being 'encrypted' if it's still accessible to unprivileged users?,"The implication of a password file being ""encrypted"" if it's still accessible to unprivileged users is that despite the encryption, the file can still be vulnerable and used in dictionary attacks."
Where is the actual password file hidden in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, the actual password file is hidden in /etc/shadow."
What is the primary security benefit of restricting read access to the password file to privileged users?,"The primary security benefit of restricting read access to the password file to privileged users is that, in theory, passwords could then be stored unencrypted without immediate compromise."
"Explain the vulnerability that arises if a password file, even if encrypted, is accessible to unprivileged users.","If a password file, even if encrypted, contains data required by unprivileged users, it remains vulnerable because such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks, despite the encryption."
Describe the two steps involved in user acceptance based on features.,"The two steps involved in user acceptance based on features are: first, measuring the similarity between reference features and current features; and second, accepting the user if the match is above a predefined threshold."
Define 'False Positive' in the context of user authentication failure rates.,"In the context of user authentication failure rates, a False Positive occurs when the system accepts a wrong user. This constitutes a security problem."
Define 'False Negative' in the context of user authentication failure rates.,"In the context of user authentication failure rates, a False Negative occurs when the system rejects a legitimate user. This creates embarrassment and an inefficient work environment."
What are the consequences of a 'False Positive' in an authentication system?,"The consequence of a 'False Positive' in an authentication system is that a wrong user is accepted, which creates a security problem."
What are the consequences of a 'False Negative' in an authentication system?,"The consequences of a 'False Negative' in an authentication system are that a legitimate user is rejected, which creates embarrassment and an inefficient work environment."
How is user acceptance determined in systems that measure feature similarity?,"User acceptance in systems that measure feature similarity is determined by comparing current features against reference features. If the similarity between them is above a predefined threshold, the user is accepted."
What is the 'predefined threshold' in user acceptance systems?,"The 'predefined threshold' in user acceptance systems is a specific level of similarity between reference features and current features that, if exceeded, results in the user being accepted."
What kind of problem does a False Positive represent?,A False Positive represents a security problem because it involves accepting a wrong user.
What kind of issues does a False Negative create?,A False Negative creates issues of embarrassment and an inefficient work environment because it involves rejecting a legitimate user.
