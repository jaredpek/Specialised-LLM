What are the alternative forms of passwords mentioned in the document?,"The document mentions four alternative forms of passwords:\n1.  **Passphrase:** Users enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size passwords. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size, often called a hash value or hash code.\n2.  **Visual drawing patterns:** These are used on touch interfaces, such as in Android devices.\n3.  **Picture passwords:** Users select objects within pictures and patterns. This method is used in Windows 8.\n4.  **One-time passwords:** These are passwords that are valid for only one login session or transaction."
How does a passphrase work as an alternative form of password?,"A passphrase works by allowing the user to enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to recall. The system then processes this input using a hash function to compute the actual password, which is of a fixed size. A **hash function** is a cryptographic algorithm that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string (the 'hash value' or 'digest')."
Where are visual drawing patterns typically used as a password alternative?,"Visual drawing patterns are typically used on touch interfaces, for example, in Android operating systems, as an alternative form of password."
Explain what picture passwords are and where they are utilized.,Picture passwords involve the user selecting specific objects within pictures and patterns to authenticate. This method is utilized in Windows 8.
What is the purpose of a one-time password?,"A one-time password is an alternative form of password designed to be valid for only a single login session or transaction, enhancing security by preventing replay attacks."
What is the primary function of the password file in an operating system?,The primary function of the password file in an operating system is to maintain a record of user names and their corresponding passwords.
What risks does a password file face from an attacker?,"An attacker could attempt to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. **Confidentiality** refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, while **integrity** refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, preventing unauthorized modification."
What are the main options for protecting a password file?,"The main options for protecting a password file include:\n*   **Cryptographic protection:** This involves using encryption to secure the password data. **Encryption** is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.\n*   **Access control enforced by the operating system:** This limits who can read, write, or execute the password file. **Access control** is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment.\n*   A combination of cryptographic protection and access control, potentially with additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks. A **dictionary attack** is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password."
How does cryptographic protection help secure a password file?,"Cryptographic protection helps secure a password file by encrypting the password data, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals. **Encryption** is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access."
What role does access control play in protecting the password file?,"Access control, enforced by the operating system, plays a crucial role in protecting the password file by regulating which users or processes have permission to access, read, or modify the file. This prevents unauthorized access and potential compromise."
Why is a combination of cryptographic protection and access control recommended for password file security?,"A combination of cryptographic protection and access control is recommended for password file security because it provides a layered defense. Cryptographic protection encrypts the data, while access control restricts who can even attempt to access the encrypted file. This combined approach, possibly with measures to slow dictionary attacks, offers robust protection against various threats."
What is a dictionary attack in the context of password security?,"In the context of password security, a **dictionary attack** is a method where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying every word in a dictionary as a password. This method can be slowed down by implementing additional security measures."
What is the importance of privileged users having write access to the password file?,"Only privileged users must have write access to the password file. This is important because if non-privileged users had write access, an attacker could gain access to the data of other users simply by changing their passwords, even if the file itself is protected by cryptographic means. **Privileged users** are those with elevated permissions or administrative rights within a system."
What happens if non-privileged users have write access to the password file?,"If non-privileged users have write access to the password file, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the data of other users. They could simply change another user's password, thereby compromising their account, even if the password file is protected by cryptographic means."
Under what condition could passwords theoretically be stored unencrypted?,"Passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted if read access to the password file is strictly restricted to only privileged users. However, this is generally not recommended due to other potential vulnerabilities."
"Why must passwords be ""encrypted"" if the password file contains data required by unprivileged users?","If the password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted"" to prevent direct exposure. However, even with this ""encryption,"" such a file can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks, meaning the encryption might not be strong enough to prevent all forms of brute-force guessing."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users by hiding it in a specific location, typically `/etc/shadow`. This file is configured to be inaccessible to non-privileged users, thereby enhancing security."
What is `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems and its security significance?,"In Unix/Linux systems, `/etc/shadow` is a file where the actual password hashes are stored. Its security significance lies in the fact that it is hidden and inaccessible to non-privileged users, preventing them from directly reading password data and thus mitigating risks like dictionary attacks."
Describe the general process for user acceptance based on feature similarity.,"The general process for user acceptance based on feature similarity involves two steps: first, measuring the similarity between reference features and current features. Second, the user is accepted if the measured match is above a predefined threshold. **Reference features** are stored biometric or credential data for comparison, while **current features** are the data provided by the user during an authentication attempt."
"What is a ""predefined threshold"" in the context of user acceptance based on feature similarity?","A ""predefined threshold"" in the context of user acceptance based on feature similarity is a specific value or level that the measured similarity between reference features and current features must exceed for a user to be accepted. If the similarity score is below this threshold, the user is rejected."
Define a False Positive in the context of user authentication failure rates.,"In the context of user authentication failure rates, a **False Positive** occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user. This represents a significant security problem as an unauthorized individual gains access."
Define a False Negative in the context of user authentication failure rates.,"In the context of user authentication failure rates, a **False Negative** occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. This leads to embarrassment for the user and creates an inefficient work environment."
What are the consequences of a False Positive in an authentication system?,"The consequence of a False Positive in an authentication system is a security problem, as it means an incorrect or unauthorized user is accepted by the system, potentially granting them access to sensitive information or resources."
What are the consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system?,The consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system include creating embarrassment for the legitimate user who is wrongly rejected and contributing to an inefficient work environment due to access issues.
Are fingerprints and biometric traits truly unique and secret?,"While fingerprints and biometric traits may generally be unique, the document states that they are ""no secrets."" This implies that despite their uniqueness, they are not inherently secure from being copied or forged."
Provide an example of how fingerprints have been compromised.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s. Similar attacks were also shown to apply to the Samsung S5 phone, indicating that biometric data can be compromised."
"What are ""rubber fingers"" in the context of fingerprint recognition?","""Rubber fingers"" refer to a method of forging fingerprints, which has successfully defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems in the past. This highlights a vulnerability in biometric authentication."
"When is the issue of ""rubber fingers"" considered minor for authentication?","The issue of ""rubber fingers"" is considered minor for authentication if the authentication process takes place in the physical presence of security personnel, as they can visually verify the user and potentially detect the use of forged biometrics."
"What precautions are needed when authenticating remote users against ""rubber finger"" fraud?","When authenticating remote users, additional precautions must be taken to counteract the type of fraud associated with ""rubber fingers."" This implies the need for multi-factor authentication or other advanced verification methods beyond just fingerprint recognition."
Why is secure storage of biometric data important?,"Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement primarily from the angle of personal privacy protection. Protecting this data prevents its unauthorized access, misuse, or compromise, which could have significant privacy implications for individuals."
What is a hash function and its role in passphrases?,"A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (in the case of passphrases, the user's long phrase) and converts it into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value or digest. Its role in passphrases is to compute the actual fixed-size password from the user's easily remembered sentence or phrase."
How does the operating system protect the confidentiality of user passwords?,"The operating system protects the confidentiality of user passwords by maintaining them in a password file and offering options like cryptographic protection and access control. Cryptographic protection encrypts the data, while access control restricts who can read the file, especially for sensitive parts like `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux."
What is the difference between confidentiality and integrity in the context of the password file?,"In the context of the password file, **confidentiality** refers to ensuring that the password data is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals. **Integrity** refers to ensuring that the password data has not been altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties. An attacker could compromise either or both."
Explain how access control enforced by the operating system works to protect the password file.,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by setting permissions that dictate which users or processes can perform specific actions (like read, write, or execute) on the file. For instance, only privileged users may have write access, and in systems like Unix/Linux, the actual password file (`/etc/shadow`) is made inaccessible to non-privileged users."
"What is the significance of the ""fixed-size"" actual passwords computed from passphrases?","The significance of ""fixed-size"" actual passwords computed from passphrases is that regardless of the length of the user's input phrase, the output password used by the system will always be a consistent length. This is a characteristic of hash functions, which are used to process the passphrase, making it suitable for storage and comparison."
How can dictionary attacks be mitigated when protecting a password file?,"Dictionary attacks can be mitigated when protecting a password file by implementing further measures in addition to cryptographic protection and access control. These measures are designed to slow down such attacks, making them computationally more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker."
Why is it a security problem if an attacker can change other users' passwords?,"It is a security problem if an attacker can change other users' passwords because it grants them unauthorized access to those users' accounts and data. This bypasses any existing cryptographic protection on the password file itself, as the attacker is essentially creating new valid credentials."
"What does it mean for biometric traits to have ""no secrets""?","For biometric traits to have ""no secrets"" means that despite their potential uniqueness to an individual, they are not inherently private or difficult to obtain. Examples like hackers lifting fingerprints from devices demonstrate that these traits can be copied or reproduced, making them vulnerable to forgery."
"How does the presence of security personnel affect the risk of ""rubber finger"" fraud?","The presence of security personnel significantly reduces the risk of ""rubber finger"" fraud because they can visually inspect the user and the authentication process. This human oversight can detect the use of forged biometric inputs that automated systems might miss."
What is the primary concern regarding the storage of biometric data?,"The primary concern regarding the storage of biometric data is personal privacy protection. If biometric data is not stored securely, it could be compromised, leading to identity theft or other privacy violations, as biometric data is often immutable and linked directly to an individual."
"Can a password file containing ""encrypted"" passwords still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks?","Yes, a password file containing ""encrypted"" passwords can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks, especially if the encryption method is weak or if the ""encryption"" refers to hashing. Attackers can pre-compute hashes of common dictionary words and compare them to the stored (hashed) passwords."
"What is the role of a ""reference feature"" in user acceptance?","A ""reference feature"" in user acceptance is the stored, known characteristic or data point (e.g., a biometric template or password hash) of a legitimate user. It serves as the baseline against which the ""current features"" provided during an authentication attempt are compared to determine a match."
"What is the role of ""current features"" in user acceptance?","""Current features"" in user acceptance are the characteristics or data points provided by a user during an authentication attempt. These features are compared against the stored ""reference features"" to determine if there is a sufficient match for the user to be accepted."
Why is it important to restrict read access to the password file for non-privileged users?,"It is important to restrict read access to the password file for non-privileged users because if they can read the file, they might be able to extract password hashes or even plain-text passwords (if stored unencrypted, which is not recommended). This information could then be used for dictionary attacks or other forms of unauthorized access."
What specific operating system is mentioned for using picture passwords?,"Windows 8 is the specific operating system mentioned for using picture passwords, where users select objects in pictures and patterns for authentication."
What specific operating system is mentioned for using visual drawing patterns?,Android is the specific operating system mentioned for using visual drawing patterns on touch interfaces as an alternative form of password.
"What is the general concept of ""authentication"" as implied by the document's context?","The general concept of **authentication**, as implied by the document's context, refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. This is achieved by comparing provided credentials (like passwords, passphrases, biometric data) against stored reference data to determine if there is a sufficient match for acceptance."
"How does the concept of ""predefined threshold"" relate to both False Positives and False Negatives?","The concept of a ""predefined threshold"" directly relates to both False Positives and False Negatives. If the threshold is set too low, it increases the likelihood of a False Positive (accepting a wrong user). If the threshold is set too high, it increases the likelihood of a False Negative (rejecting a legitimate user). Balancing this threshold is crucial for security and usability."
"What is the primary goal of ""protecting the password file""?","The primary goal of ""protecting the password file"" is to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of user names and passwords stored within it. This prevents unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure of sensitive authentication information, thereby securing user accounts and the system as a whole."
How does the use of a hash function for passphrases contribute to security?,"The use of a hash function for passphrases contributes to security by transforming the user's input into a fixed-size, one-way hash. This means that the actual passphrase is not stored directly, making it harder for attackers to retrieve the original phrase even if they gain access to the hashed password. A **one-way hash function** is computationally infeasible to reverse, meaning it's extremely difficult to derive the original input from the hash value."
