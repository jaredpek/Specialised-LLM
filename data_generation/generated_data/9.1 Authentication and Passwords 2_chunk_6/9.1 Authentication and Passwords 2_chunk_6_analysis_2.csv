Describe the concept of a passphrase as an alternative form of password.,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual passwords, which are of a fixed size. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size, often called a hash value or hash code. This process is one-way, meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function to get the original passphrase."
Explain how visual drawing patterns are used as an alternative password mechanism.,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative password mechanism primarily used on touch interfaces. This method involves a user drawing a specific pattern on a screen, which then serves as their authentication credential. An example of its use is found in Android operating systems. A **touch interface** is a display screen that allows users to interact with a device by touching areas on the screen."
What are picture passwords and in which operating system are they commonly used?,"Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns to log in. This method is commonly used in Windows 8. The user defines a sequence of taps, circles, or lines on a chosen image to create their password. An **operating system** is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs."
Identify the four alternative forms of passwords mentioned.,"The four alternative forms of passwords mentioned are Passphrase, Visual drawing patterns, Picture passwords, and One-time passwords. A **Passphrase** involves users entering sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, with the system using a hash function to compute fixed-size actual passwords. **Visual drawing patterns** are used on touch interfaces, such as in Android. **Picture passwords** require users to select objects in pictures and patterns, as seen in Windows 8. **One-time passwords** are credentials valid for only one login session or transaction."
Discuss the primary function of the operating system regarding user authentication data.,"The operating system maintains a file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. This **password file** is a critical component for user authentication, allowing the system to verify a user's identity based on the credentials they provide. **User authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a system or resource."
What risks does an attacker pose to the password file?,"An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. **Confidentiality** refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning an attacker could steal the passwords. **Integrity** refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, meaning an attacker could alter the passwords or user accounts."
Enumerate the options available for protecting the password file.,"Options for protecting the password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, or a combination of both cryptographic protection and access control. The combined approach may also incorporate further measures to slow down dictionary attacks. **Cryptographic protection** involves using encryption to secure the data, making it unreadable without the correct key. **Access control** refers to mechanisms that restrict who can access or modify the file."
Explain cryptographic protection as a method for securing the password file.,"Cryptographic protection is a method for securing the password file by encrypting its contents. This means that the passwords stored within the file are transformed into an unreadable format using an encryption algorithm and a key. Without the correct decryption key, the information remains confidential, even if an unauthorized party gains access to the file. **Encryption** is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it."
How does access control enforced by the operating system contribute to password file protection?,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by restricting which users or processes can read, write, or execute the file. This mechanism ensures that only authorized entities, typically privileged users or system processes, can interact with the password file, thereby preventing unauthorized access or modification. **Access control** is a security technique that regulates who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment."
Describe the combined approach to password file protection and its additional benefits.,"The combined approach to password file protection involves using both cryptographic protection and access control. This method offers enhanced security by encrypting the file's contents while also restricting who can access the file itself. Additionally, this approach can include further measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks. A **dictionary attack** is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password."
What is the significance of restricting write access to the password file to only privileged users?,"Restricting write access to the password file to only privileged users is crucial because, otherwise, an attacker could gain access to the data of other users simply by changing their password. This vulnerability exists even if the password file is protected by cryptographic means. **Privileged users** are those with elevated permissions or administrative rights within an operating system, allowing them to perform critical system functions. **Write access** refers to the permission to modify or alter the contents of a file."
"Under what condition could passwords theoretically be stored unencrypted, and what is the prerequisite for this?","Passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted if read access to the password file is strictly restricted to privileged users. This prerequisite ensures that only authorized system administrators or processes can view the contents of the file, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized disclosure, even without encryption. **Unencrypted** means the data is in its original, readable form, without any cryptographic transformation. **Read access** refers to the permission to view or retrieve the contents of a file."
"When a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, what security measure is necessary for passwords, and what is a persistent risk?","When a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted"" to protect them. However, even with this encryption, such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks. This implies that the 'encryption' might refer to hashing rather than reversible encryption, or that the encryption key could be compromised, allowing for offline brute-force attempts like dictionary attacks. **Unprivileged users** are standard users with limited permissions, typically restricted from performing system-level operations."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems address the security concern of password files being accessible to unprivileged users?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems address the security concern of password files being accessible to unprivileged users by hiding the actual password file in `/etc/shadow`. This specific file is not accessible to non-privileged users, meaning only the root user or processes with elevated privileges can read or modify it. This mechanism prevents unauthorized users from directly accessing hashed password information, thereby enhancing system security. The `/etc/shadow` file stores encrypted user passwords and other security-related information."
Define 'write access' in the context of password file security.,"In the context of password file security, 'write access' refers to the permission for a user or process to modify the contents of the password file. This includes actions such as changing existing passwords, adding new user accounts, or deleting accounts. Restricting write access is critical to prevent unauthorized alteration of user credentials. **Password file security** encompasses measures taken to protect the file containing user authentication data from unauthorized access or modification."
What is a dictionary attack and how does it relate to password file protection?,"A dictionary attack is a method of attempting to break into a password-protected system by trying every word in a pre-compiled list or 'dictionary' as a password. It relates to password file protection because even if passwords are 'encrypted' (often hashed) in a file accessible to unprivileged users, this file can still be used in dictionary attacks. Measures to slow down dictionary attacks are often combined with cryptographic protection and access control to enhance security. A **pre-compiled list** or dictionary contains common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords."
Describe the two main steps involved in user acceptance based on feature similarity.,"User acceptance based on feature similarity involves two main steps. First, the system measures the similarity between reference features and current features. Second, the user is accepted if the measured match is above a predefined threshold. **Reference features** are the stored biometric or credential data of an authorized user, while **current features** are the data provided by the user attempting to authenticate. **User acceptance** in this context refers to the system's decision to grant access to a user after successful authentication."
Define 'predefined threshold' in the context of user acceptance.,"In the context of user acceptance, a 'predefined threshold' is a specific value or level that the similarity score between reference features and current features must exceed for a user to be accepted. If the similarity score meets or surpasses this threshold, the system considers the user authenticated; otherwise, authentication fails. This threshold is set to balance security and usability. A **similarity score** is a numerical value indicating how closely two sets of features match."
What is a False Positive in authentication systems and what is its consequence?,"A False Positive in authentication systems occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user. This means an unauthorized individual is granted access. The consequence of a False Positive is a significant security problem, as it directly compromises the system's integrity and confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access. A **wrong user** refers to an individual who is not authorized to access the system."
What is a False Negative in authentication systems and what are its consequences?,"A False Negative in authentication systems occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. This means an authorized individual is denied access. The consequences of a False Negative include creating embarrassment for the legitimate user and leading to an inefficient work environment, as authorized personnel are unable to perform their tasks. A **legitimate user** is an individual who is authorized to access the system."
Analyze the trade-off between False Positives and False Negatives in authentication.,"The trade-off between False Positives and False Negatives in authentication systems involves balancing security against usability and efficiency. A **False Positive** (accepting a wrong user) creates a security problem, compromising system integrity. A **False Negative** (rejecting a legitimate user) causes embarrassment and an inefficient work environment. Adjusting the predefined threshold for user acceptance directly impacts this trade-off: a higher threshold reduces False Positives but increases False Negatives, while a lower threshold increases False Positives but reduces False Negatives. This balance is critical for system design."
Discuss the general characteristic of fingerprints and biometric traits regarding their secrecy.,"In general, fingerprints and biometric traits may be unique to an individual, but they are not secrets. This means that while each person's biometric data might be distinct, the data itself can be obtained or replicated by others, making it vulnerable to compromise. The lack of inherent secrecy poses a challenge for their use in authentication systems, as compromised biometrics cannot be easily changed like a password. **Biometric traits** are unique physical or behavioral characteristics used for identification."
Provide an example of how hackers have compromised fingerprints from mobile devices.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s. Similar attacks were also shown to apply to Samsung S5 phones. This illustrates that despite the perceived uniqueness of fingerprints, methods exist for unauthorized individuals to acquire and potentially use them to bypass biometric authentication systems. **Biometric authentication** is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify their identity."
Explain the concept of 'Rubber Fingers' in the context of fingerprint recognition systems.,"'Rubber Fingers' refers to the use of artificial or replicated fingerprints, often made from materials like rubber or gelatin, to spoof or defeat commercial fingerprint recognition systems. These fabricated fingerprints can mimic a legitimate user's print, allowing an unauthorized individual to gain access. This method has successfully bypassed many such systems in the past. **Spoofing** in biometrics refers to presenting a fake biometric sample to a sensor to impersonate a legitimate user."
Under what condition is the issue of 'Rubber Fingers' considered minor?,"The issue of 'Rubber Fingers' is considered minor if authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel. When security personnel are present, they can visually inspect the user and the authentication process, making it more difficult for an attacker to use a fabricated fingerprint without being detected. This human oversight adds an additional layer of security. **Security personnel** are individuals trained to protect people, property, and information."
What additional precautions are necessary when authenticating remote users to counteract 'Rubber Fingers' fraud?,"When authenticating remote users, additional precautions must be taken to counteract the type of fraud associated with 'Rubber Fingers'. Since security personnel are not physically present to observe the authentication process, remote systems need robust mechanisms to detect spoofed fingerprints or to incorporate multi-factor authentication to verify the user's identity through other means. **Remote users** are individuals attempting to access a system or service from a location outside the immediate physical control of the system's administrators. **Multi-factor authentication** requires two or more verification methods to grant access."
Why is secure storage of biometric data an important requirement?,"Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement primarily from the angle of personal privacy protection. If biometric data, such as fingerprints, is compromised, it cannot be easily changed like a password, leading to permanent privacy risks for the individual. Therefore, robust security measures are essential to protect this sensitive personal information from unauthorized access or misuse. **Personal privacy protection** refers to safeguarding an individual's personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure."
Compare and contrast Passphrases with traditional passwords based on the provided information.,"Passphrases differ from traditional passwords in their structure and memorability. Passphrases involve users entering sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, whereas traditional passwords are typically shorter strings of characters. While both ultimately lead to a fixed-size actual password computed by a hash function, the user experience and potential for complexity are different. Passphrases leverage natural language, making them easier for humans to recall, potentially leading to stronger, less guessable credentials than short, complex character strings often associated with traditional passwords. A **traditional password** is typically a string of characters used for authentication."
Discuss the role of a hash function in the context of passphrases.,"In the context of passphrases, a hash function is applied by the system to compute the actual passwords, which are of a fixed size, from the user's entered sentences or long phrases. This means that the passphrase itself is not stored directly. Instead, its hashed representation is stored and used for verification. A **hash function** is a one-way mathematical algorithm that transforms an input (the passphrase) into a fixed-size string of characters (the hash value), making it computationally infeasible to reverse the process and retrieve the original passphrase from the hash."
What is the primary benefit of using one-time passwords?,"The primary benefit of using one-time passwords is that they are valid for only a single login session or transaction. This significantly enhances security because even if an attacker intercepts a one-time password, it becomes useless after its first use, preventing replay attacks. A **one-time password (OTP)** is an automatically generated numeric or alphanumeric string of characters that authenticates the user for a single transaction or login session. A **replay attack** is a form of network attack in which a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed."
How does the operating system's role in maintaining a password file relate to system security?,"The operating system's role in maintaining a password file is fundamental to system security because this file contains the credentials (usernames and passwords) necessary for user authentication. If this file's confidentiality or integrity is compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts or the entire system. Therefore, robust protection mechanisms for this file are paramount to ensure secure user authentication and overall system security. **System security** refers to the protection of computer systems and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction."
Explain the concept of 'confidentiality' in relation to the password file.,"In relation to the password file, 'confidentiality' refers to the principle that the information contained within the file, specifically user passwords, should only be accessible to authorized entities. Compromising confidentiality means that an unauthorized individual has gained access to the passwords, potentially leading to identity theft or unauthorized system access. Protecting confidentiality is a key goal of security measures like cryptographic protection. **Identity theft** is the fraudulent appropriation and use of someone's identifying data or credentials."
Explain the concept of 'integrity' in relation to the password file.,"In relation to the password file, 'integrity' refers to the principle that the information contained within the file, specifically user passwords and usernames, should be accurate and complete, and should not be subject to unauthorized modification. Compromising integrity means that an unauthorized individual has altered the passwords or user accounts, which could lead to denial of service, unauthorized access, or other security breaches. Protecting integrity is a key goal of security measures like access control. **Denial of service** is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users."
What specific vulnerability does changing other users' passwords present if write access to the password file is not restricted?,"If write access to the password file is not restricted to privileged users, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to change other users' passwords. This allows the attacker to gain access to those users' data and accounts, even if the original passwords were protected by cryptographic means. The ability to arbitrarily change passwords undermines the entire authentication system and user security. **Vulnerability** refers to a weakness that could be exploited by a threat actor."
"Why is it important to slow down dictionary attacks, especially when combining cryptographic protection and access control?","It is important to slow down dictionary attacks, even when combining cryptographic protection and access control, because these attacks can still be effective against hashed or 'encrypted' passwords if an attacker obtains the password file. By slowing down the attack, the system makes it computationally more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to guess passwords, thereby increasing the security of user accounts and providing more time for detection and mitigation. **Hashed passwords** are passwords transformed into a fixed-size string of characters using a hash function, making them difficult to reverse."
Describe the security implications if a password file containing data for unprivileged users is only 'encrypted' but not properly secured against dictionary attacks.,"If a password file containing data for unprivileged users is only 'encrypted' (likely hashed) but not properly secured against dictionary attacks, it still poses a significant security risk. An attacker who gains access to this file can perform offline dictionary attacks, systematically trying common words and phrases against the hashed passwords. Even though the passwords are not stored in plaintext, the attacker can still deduce them if the hashing algorithm is weak or if the passwords themselves are simple and found in a dictionary. This undermines the protection offered by the 'encryption'. **Offline dictionary attacks** occur when an attacker has obtained a copy of the hashed password file and attempts to crack passwords without direct interaction with the authentication system."
What is the primary purpose of the `/etc/shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"The primary purpose of the `/etc/shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems is to securely store actual password hashes, making them inaccessible to non-privileged users. This separation of password hashes from the `/etc/passwd` file (which contains user account information but not password hashes) enhances security by preventing unprivileged users from reading potentially vulnerable password data, even if they can access other user information. **Password hashes** are the one-way encrypted representations of passwords."
How does measuring similarity between reference and current features contribute to authentication?,"Measuring similarity between reference features and current features is the core mechanism for verifying a user's identity in certain authentication systems, particularly biometric ones. The system compares the newly presented features (current features) with the previously stored, authorized features (reference features). A high degree of similarity indicates a match, suggesting the user is legitimate. This comparison forms the basis for deciding whether to accept or reject the user. **Reference features** are the stored template of an authorized user's biometric or credential data, while **current features** are the data captured during the authentication attempt."
"Explain why fingerprints, despite being unique, are considered to have 'no secrets'.","Fingerprints, despite being unique to an individual, are considered to have 'no secrets' because they are external and can be acquired or replicated without the owner's explicit consent or knowledge. Unlike a password that is kept private, fingerprints are left on surfaces and can be lifted, as demonstrated by hackers lifting prints from mobile phones. This inherent accessibility means they can be compromised, and once compromised, they cannot be easily changed, posing a persistent security risk. **Compromised** in this context means that the security of the data has been breached, making it accessible to unauthorized parties."
What is the implication of hackers being able to lift fingerprints from mobile devices like the iPhone 5s and Samsung S5?,"The implication of hackers being able to lift fingerprints from mobile devices like the iPhone 5s and Samsung S5 is that biometric authentication, specifically fingerprint recognition, is vulnerable to spoofing. This demonstrates that even advanced commercial systems can be defeated by sophisticated attacks, highlighting that physical biometrics are not foolproof security measures and can be replicated for unauthorized access. It underscores the need for multi-factor authentication or enhanced liveness detection in such systems. **Liveness detection** is a technology that verifies if the biometric sample being captured is from a living person rather than a fake."
How do 'Rubber Fingers' pose a threat to commercial fingerprint recognition systems?,"'Rubber Fingers' pose a threat to commercial fingerprint recognition systems by providing a physical means to bypass them. These fabricated fingerprints can trick the sensors into recognizing them as legitimate, allowing an unauthorized individual to gain access. This method has been effective against many systems, demonstrating a significant vulnerability where the system cannot distinguish between a live, genuine finger and a high-quality replica. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat."
What is the primary concern addressed by secure storage of biometric data?,"The primary concern addressed by secure storage of biometric data is personal privacy protection. Biometric data, such as fingerprints, is inherently linked to an individual's identity and cannot be easily changed if compromised. Therefore, ensuring its secure storage is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or identity theft, thereby safeguarding an individual's long-term privacy. **Biometric data** refers to unique biological characteristics of an individual, such as fingerprints, used for identification."
Describe the characteristics of a 'fixed-size' actual password as computed by a hash function for a passphrase.,"A 'fixed-size' actual password, as computed by a hash function for a passphrase, means that regardless of the length or complexity of the original passphrase (which can be a long sentence), the output generated by the hash function will always have a predetermined, consistent length. This fixed size is a characteristic of cryptographic hash functions, ensuring that the stored representation of the password is uniform and does not reveal information about the original passphrase's length. A **cryptographic hash function** is a hash function that is considered practically impossible to invert, meaning it's extremely difficult to compute the input from the output."
What is the role of a touch interface in visual drawing patterns for authentication?,"The touch interface plays a crucial role in visual drawing patterns for authentication as it is the medium through which the user interacts with the system to provide their credential. Users draw their specific pattern directly on the touch-sensitive screen, and the system records this input for verification. Without a touch interface, this method of authentication would not be feasible. A **touch interface** is a display screen that allows users to interact with a device by touching areas on the screen."
How does the selection of objects in pictures and patterns function as a password mechanism?,"The selection of objects in pictures and patterns functions as a password mechanism by requiring the user to identify and interact with specific elements within a visual image in a predefined sequence. Instead of typing characters, the user might tap on certain objects, draw lines between them, or trace a pattern. This sequence of interactions serves as the unique credential for authentication, as exemplified in Windows 8. The system verifies the correctness of the selected objects and their order against a stored reference. A **credential** is a piece of information used to verify a user's identity."
What is the fundamental difference between cryptographic protection and access control for password file security?,"The fundamental difference between cryptographic protection and access control for password file security lies in their primary mechanisms. **Cryptographic protection** focuses on transforming the data itself (passwords) into an unreadable format through encryption, making it unintelligible even if accessed. **Access control**, on the other hand, focuses on restricting who can access the file in the first place, regardless of its content's format. Cryptographic protection primarily secures the data's confidentiality, while access control primarily secures the file's availability and integrity by regulating permissions. **Availability** refers to ensuring that authorized users can access information and systems when needed."
"Explain why an attacker could still compromise user data by changing passwords even if the password file is cryptographically protected, if write access is not restricted.","An attacker could still compromise user data by changing passwords even if the password file is cryptographically protected, if write access is not restricted, because cryptographic protection primarily secures the *confidentiality* of the stored passwords. If an attacker has write access, they can overwrite the cryptographically protected (hashed) password entry with a new hash corresponding to a password of their choosing. This effectively changes the user's password, allowing the attacker to log in as that user, bypassing the original cryptographic protection of the old password. The integrity of the file is compromised, even if its confidentiality was maintained. **Compromise** means to expose to danger or risk."
What is the primary goal of setting a 'predefined threshold' in authentication systems?,"The primary goal of setting a 'predefined threshold' in authentication systems is to establish a clear decision point for user acceptance, balancing security and usability. This threshold determines the minimum level of similarity required between current and reference features for a user to be authenticated. It aims to minimize both False Positives (accepting wrong users) and False Negatives (rejecting legitimate users) to achieve an optimal balance for the specific application's security and operational requirements. **Usability** refers to the ease with which users can interact with a system."
How does the presence of security personnel mitigate the risk of 'Rubber Fingers'?,"The presence of security personnel mitigates the risk of 'Rubber Fingers' by introducing human observation and verification into the authentication process. Security personnel can visually inspect the user attempting to authenticate, ensuring that a genuine finger is being used and not a fabricated replica. This human element acts as a deterrent and a detection mechanism against physical spoofing attempts that automated systems might miss, making it a minor issue under such supervised conditions. A **deterrent** is something that discourages or prevents an action."
"Why is it problematic that compromised biometric data, unlike passwords, cannot be easily changed?","It is problematic that compromised biometric data, unlike passwords, cannot be easily changed because biometric traits are inherent and permanent characteristics of an individual. If a password is stolen, it can be reset or changed, effectively neutralizing the threat. However, if a fingerprint or other biometric data is compromised, the individual cannot simply 'change' their fingerprint. This means that a compromised biometric credential could potentially be used indefinitely for unauthorized access, posing a long-term and irreversible security and privacy risk for the individual. A **biometric credential** is a piece of biometric data used for authentication."
