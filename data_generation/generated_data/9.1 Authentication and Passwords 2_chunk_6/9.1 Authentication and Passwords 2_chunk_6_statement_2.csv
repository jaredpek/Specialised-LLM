"Define a ""Passphrase"" as an alternative form of password.","A Passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual passwords, which are fixed-size. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size, known as a hash value or hash."
Explain how a system processes a user-entered passphrase to derive the actual password.,"When a user enters a passphrase, which consists of sentences or long phrases, the system applies a hash function to this input. The hash function then computes the actual password, which is of a fixed size. A hash function is a one-way mathematical algorithm that transforms an input (like a passphrase) into a fixed-size output (the actual password), making it computationally infeasible to reverse the process and derive the original passphrase from the hash."
"What are ""Visual drawing patterns"" in the context of alternative passwords?","Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password used on touch interfaces. An example of their use is in Android operating systems, where users draw a specific pattern on a grid of dots to unlock a device."
"Describe ""Picture passwords"" and provide an example of their use.","Picture passwords are an alternative form of password where users select objects in pictures and patterns to authenticate. This method was used, for example, in Windows 8."
List the alternative forms of passwords mentioned.,"The alternative forms of passwords mentioned are: Passphrases, Visual drawing patterns, Picture passwords, and One-time passwords."
"What is a ""One-time password""?",A One-time password (OTP) is an alternative form of password that is valid for only one login session or transaction.
"In which operating system are ""Picture passwords"" used?",Picture passwords are used in Windows 8.
"Where are ""Visual drawing patterns"" typically used?","Visual drawing patterns are typically used on touch interfaces, such as in Android operating systems."
How do passphrases differ from traditional passwords in terms of user input?,"Passphrases differ from traditional passwords in that users enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, rather than typically shorter, more complex character strings. The system then processes these longer inputs using a hash function to compute a fixed-size actual password."
What is the role of a hash function in the context of passphrases?,"In the context of passphrases, a hash function's role is to compute the fixed-size actual password from the user-entered sentences or long phrases. This process transforms the variable-length passphrase into a fixed-length output, which is then used for authentication. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size, known as a hash value or hash."
What is the purpose of a password file in an operating system?,An operating system maintains a password file to store user names and their corresponding passwords. This file is crucial for user authentication and system security.
What are the potential threats to a password file?,"An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. Compromising confidentiality means unauthorized access to the passwords, while compromising integrity means unauthorized modification or deletion of the password data."
List the options for protecting a password file.,"The options for protecting a password file include: cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, and a combination of cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
"Define ""cryptographic protection"" in the context of password files.","Cryptographic protection, in the context of password files, involves using encryption or hashing techniques to secure the passwords stored within the file. Encryption transforms the data into an unreadable format, requiring a key to decrypt it, while hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string, making it difficult to reverse. This protects the confidentiality of the passwords even if the file is accessed by unauthorized individuals."
"How does ""access control enforced by the operating system"" protect a password file?","Access control enforced by the operating system protects a password file by restricting who can read, write, or execute the file. This means that only authorized users or processes, typically privileged users, are granted the necessary permissions to interact with the password file, thereby preventing unauthorized access or modification."
"What is a ""dictionary attack"" and how can it be mitigated in password file protection?","A dictionary attack is a method of attempting to break into a password-protected computer system or server by trying out a large number of common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords, typically from a pre-compiled list (a \""dictionary\""). In password file protection, dictionary attacks can be mitigated by implementing further measures in combination with cryptographic protection and access control, such as rate limiting login attempts, account lockout policies, or using strong password hashing algorithms that are computationally expensive."
Why is a combination of cryptographic protection and access control recommended for password file protection?,"A combination of cryptographic protection and access control is recommended for password file protection because it provides multiple layers of security. Cryptographic protection secures the data itself, making it unreadable without the proper key, while access control restricts who can even attempt to access the file. This layered approach enhances overall security, especially when combined with measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
"What does it mean to ""compromise the confidentiality"" of a password file?","To compromise the confidentiality of a password file means that unauthorized individuals gain access to the sensitive information contained within it, specifically user names and passwords. This breach allows attackers to view or steal the password data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts."
"What does it mean to ""compromise the integrity"" of a password file?","To compromise the integrity of a password file means that unauthorized individuals have modified, altered, or deleted the data within it. This could involve changing user passwords, adding new unauthorized users, or corrupting the file, leading to system instability or unauthorized access."
Describe the role of the operating system in maintaining user authentication data.,The operating system plays a crucial role in maintaining user authentication data by keeping a dedicated file that stores user names and their corresponding passwords. This password file is essential for verifying user identities during login and other authentication processes.
Why is it important that only privileged users have write access to the password file?,"It is important that only privileged users have write access to the password file because if an attacker gains write access, they could change the passwords of other users. This would allow them to access other users' data, even if those passwords were protected by cryptographic means, effectively bypassing security measures."
What is the implication if read access to the password file is restricted only to privileged users?,"If read access to the password file is restricted only to privileged users, then passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted. This is because unprivileged users, who might otherwise attempt to read the file, would be prevented from doing so by the operating system's access control mechanisms."
"Why must passwords be ""encrypted"" if the password file contains data required by unprivileged users?","Passwords must be \""encrypted\"" if the password file contains data required by unprivileged users because even if the file is accessible to them, the actual password data needs to be protected. If the passwords are not \""encrypted\"" (typically hashed), such a file could still be used in dictionary attacks by unprivileged users who can read it, even if they cannot write to it."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users by hiding it in a specific location, /etc/shadow, which is not accessible to non-privileged users. This ensures that even if unprivileged users can access other system files, they cannot read the sensitive password hashes."
What is /etc/shadow in Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, /etc/shadow is the file where the actual password hashes are stored. It is specifically designed to be inaccessible to non-privileged users, thereby enhancing the security of user passwords by preventing unauthorized reading of sensitive authentication data."
Explain the security risk if unprivileged users have write access to the password file.,"If unprivileged users have write access to the password file, it poses a significant security risk. An attacker, potentially operating as an unprivileged user, could exploit this access to modify other users' passwords. This would grant the attacker unauthorized access to those users' accounts and data, regardless of any cryptographic protection applied to the passwords themselves."
"Can a password file containing ""encrypted"" passwords still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks?","Yes, a password file containing \""encrypted\"" (more accurately, hashed) passwords can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks, especially if the file is accessible to unprivileged users. Attackers can obtain the hashed passwords and then attempt to match them against a dictionary of pre-computed hashes for common passwords, even without being able to decrypt them."
What is the primary reason for restricting write access to the password file to privileged users?,"The primary reason for restricting write access to the password file to privileged users is to prevent attackers from changing other users' passwords. If an attacker could modify the password file, they could gain unauthorized access to other user accounts, even if the passwords were cryptographically protected."
Describe a scenario where cryptographic protection alone is insufficient for a password file.,"Cryptographic protection alone is insufficient for a password file if unprivileged users have write access to it. In such a scenario, an attacker could change other users' passwords, even if the original passwords were cryptographically protected. The attacker would not need to decrypt the original password but simply overwrite it with a new, known password."
How does the /etc/shadow file contribute to the security of passwords in Unix/Linux?,"The /etc/shadow file contributes to the security of passwords in Unix/Linux by isolating the actual password hashes in a location that is not accessible to non-privileged users. This prevents unprivileged users from reading the password hashes, thereby mitigating the risk of dictionary attacks or other offline password cracking attempts by unauthorized individuals."
How is a user accepted in a system that measures similarity between features?,A user is accepted if the measured similarity between their reference features and current features is above a predefined threshold. This threshold acts as a benchmark for determining a sufficient match.
"Define ""False Positive"" in the context of user authentication.",A False Positive in user authentication occurs when the system accepts a wrong user. This constitutes a security problem because an unauthorized individual gains access to the system.
"Define ""False Negative"" in the context of user authentication.",A False Negative in user authentication occurs when the system rejects a legitimate user. This creates embarrassment for the user and contributes to an inefficient work environment.
"What are the consequences of a ""False Positive"" in an authentication system?","The consequence of a False Positive in an authentication system is a security problem, as it means a wrong or unauthorized user is accepted into the system. This can lead to unauthorized access to data or resources."
"What are the consequences of a ""False Negative"" in an authentication system?",The consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system are that a legitimate user is rejected. This can cause embarrassment for the user and lead to an inefficient work environment due to access issues.
Explain the process of user acceptance based on feature similarity.,"The process of user acceptance based on feature similarity involves two main steps: first, measuring the similarity between the user's current features (e.g., biometric data) and their stored reference features. Second, the user is accepted if this measured similarity is above a predefined threshold. A predefined threshold is a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded for a condition to be considered true or an action to be taken."
"What is the ""new issue"" highlighted in relation to failure rates?","The ""new issue"" highlighted in relation to failure rates refers to the trade-off between False Positives and False Negatives in authentication systems. Balancing these two types of errors is crucial for both security and usability."
"How does a ""predefined threshold"" relate to user acceptance?","A predefined threshold relates to user acceptance by serving as the criterion for a successful match. If the measured similarity between a user's current features and their reference features is above this threshold, the user is accepted. If it falls below, the user is rejected. A predefined threshold is a specific value or level that must be met or exceeded for a condition to be considered true or an action to be taken."
Why is a False Positive considered a security problem?,"A False Positive is considered a security problem because it results in the acceptance of a wrong or unauthorized user. This means that an individual who should not have access is granted entry, potentially compromising the system's security, data, and resources."
Why does a False Negative create an inefficient work environment?,"A False Negative creates an inefficient work environment because it rejects a legitimate user, preventing them from accessing necessary systems or resources. This interruption can lead to delays, frustration, and lost productivity, as the user must then go through additional steps to regain access."
Are fingerprints and biometric traits generally unique and secret?,"Fingerprints and biometric traits are generally unique, but they are not secrets. This means while an individual's biometric data might be distinct, it can potentially be acquired or replicated by others."
Provide an example of how hackers have demonstrated the non-secret nature of fingerprints.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated the non-secret nature of fingerprints by showing how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s. Similar attacks were also applicable to the Samsung S5 phone, indicating that biometric data, even if unique, can be compromised."
"What are ""Rubber Fingers"" in the context of fingerprint recognition?","\""Rubber Fingers\"" refer to fabricated or replicated fingerprints, often made from materials like rubber, that have been used to defeat many commercial fingerprint recognition systems in the past. They are a form of spoofing attack."
"When is the issue of ""Rubber Fingers"" considered minor for authentication?","The issue of \""Rubber Fingers\"" is considered minor if authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel. In such a scenario, human oversight can often detect and prevent the use of forged biometric samples."
"What precautions are necessary when authenticating remote users to counteract ""Rubber Fingers"" fraud?","When authenticating remote users, additional precautions have to be taken to counteract the type of fraud involving \""Rubber Fingers.\"" These precautions are necessary because the absence of physical security personnel makes it easier for attackers to use forged biometric samples without detection."
Why is secure storage of biometric data important?,"Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement from the angle of personal privacy protection. If biometric data is not stored securely, it could be compromised, leading to privacy breaches and potential misuse of an individual's unique biological identifiers."
"How have ""Rubber Fingers"" impacted commercial fingerprint recognition systems?","\""Rubber Fingers\"" have impacted commercial fingerprint recognition systems by successfully defeating many of them in the past. This highlights a vulnerability where fabricated biometric samples can bypass authentication mechanisms."
What is the primary concern regarding the security of biometric traits despite their uniqueness?,"The primary concern regarding the security of biometric traits, despite their uniqueness, is that they are \""no secrets.\"" This means that while they are distinct to an individual, they can be acquired or replicated, as demonstrated by hackers lifting fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s."
"In what situation does the presence of security personnel mitigate the risk of ""Rubber Fingers""?","The presence of security personnel mitigates the risk of \""Rubber Fingers\"" when authentication takes place because they can visually inspect the user and the authentication process, potentially identifying and preventing the use of forged biometric samples."
What is the main implication of hackers being able to lift fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s?,"The main implication of hackers being able to lift fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s is that even advanced biometric authentication systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. It underscores that fingerprints, while unique, are not inherently secret and can be replicated, necessitating robust countermeasures and secure storage."
