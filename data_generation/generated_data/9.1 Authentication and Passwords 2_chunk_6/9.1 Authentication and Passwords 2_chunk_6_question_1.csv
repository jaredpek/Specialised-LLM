What is a passphrase as an alternative form of password?,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual password, which is of a fixed size."
How does a system process a passphrase to compute an actual password?,"When a user enters a passphrase, which is a sentence or a long phrase, the system applies a hash function to this input. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (like a passphrase) into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value or digest. This fixed-size hash value then serves as the actual password for authentication."
What are visual drawing patterns in the context of alternative passwords?,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password that are typically used on touch interfaces. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on the screen, which the system recognizes as their password."
Where are visual drawing patterns commonly used for authentication?,"Visual drawing patterns are commonly used for authentication on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android operating systems."
What are picture passwords?,Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects or patterns within a given picture to log in.

In which operating system are picture passwords utilized?,Picture passwords are utilized in Windows 8.
What is the concept of one-time passwords?,"One-time passwords (OTPs) are an alternative form of password that are valid for only a single login session or transaction, typically for a short period. The document lists them as an alternative form of password without further detail on their generation or usage."
What is the primary function of a password file?,The primary function of a password file is to be maintained by the operating system to store user names and their corresponding passwords.
What are the potential threats to a password file?,"An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the passwords, while compromising integrity means altering the passwords or user data without authorization."
What are the main options for protecting a password file?,"The main options for protecting a password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, or a combination of both cryptographic protection and access control. Further measures can also be implemented to slow down dictionary attacks."
Explain cryptographic protection for a password file.,"Cryptographic protection for a password file involves using encryption techniques to secure the data within the file. Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the file, the passwords would be unreadable without the correct decryption key."
How does access control protect a password file?,"Access control protects a password file by enforcing rules that dictate which users or processes are allowed to access the file and what operations (like read, write, execute) they can perform. This is typically managed by the operating system to restrict unauthorized access."
Describe a combined approach to password file protection.,"A combined approach to password file protection involves using both cryptographic protection and access control. Cryptographic protection encrypts the contents of the file, while access control restricts who can even attempt to access the encrypted file. This combination provides multiple layers of security."
What additional measures can be taken with combined protection to enhance security?,"With combined cryptographic protection and access control, further measures can be implemented to slow down dictionary attacks. A dictionary attack is a method of attempting to break into a password-protected computer system or service by systematically trying every word in a dictionary as a password. These additional measures make it harder and more time-consuming for attackers to guess passwords."
What is a dictionary attack in the context of password file protection?,"A dictionary attack, in the context of password file protection, is an attempt by an attacker to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying common words, phrases, or pre-computed hashes (often from a dictionary or a list of common passwords) against the stored password hashes in the file. Measures are often taken to slow down such attacks."
Who should have write access to the password file?,"Only privileged users must have write access to the password file. Privileged users are those with elevated permissions, typically system administrators, who are authorized to modify system-critical files."
Why is it important to restrict write access to the password file to privileged users?,"It is important to restrict write access to the password file to privileged users because if an attacker gains write access, they could change the passwords of other users. This would allow them to access other users' data, even if the password file itself is protected by cryptographic means, as they would be modifying the protected data directly."
What is the implication if read access to passwords is restricted only to privileged users?,"If read access to passwords is restricted only to privileged users, then in theory, passwords could be stored unencrypted. This is because only authorized personnel would be able to view them, reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure from direct file access."
"When must passwords be ""encrypted"" in a password file?","Passwords must be \""encrypted\"" in a password file if the file contains data that is required by unprivileged users. This is a security measure to protect the passwords from being directly read by users who do not have privileged access, even though such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks."
"What is the risk associated with ""encrypted"" password files if they contain data required by unprivileged users?","Even if passwords in a file are \""encrypted\"" and the file contains data required by unprivileged users, there is still a risk: such a file can be used in dictionary attacks. This implies that the \""encryption\"" might refer to hashing, which is a one-way function, and attackers can pre-compute hashes of common passwords to compare against the stored hashes."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users by hiding it in a specific location, typically /etc/shadow. This file is configured such that it is not accessible to non-privileged users, thereby preventing them from reading or modifying password information."
What is the significance of the /etc/shadow file in Unix/Linux systems?,"The /etc/shadow file in Unix/Linux systems is significant because it is where the actual password file is hidden. Its inaccessibility to non-privileged users is a key security measure, preventing unauthorized access to password data and mitigating risks like dictionary attacks or direct password theft."
How is a user accepted in a system based on features?,"A user is accepted in a system if the match between their current features and reference features is above a predefined threshold. The system first measures the similarity between these features, and if this similarity score exceeds the threshold, the user is granted access."
What is a predefined threshold in the context of user acceptance?,"A predefined threshold in the context of user acceptance is a specific value or limit set by the system. If the measured similarity between a user's current features and their stored reference features exceeds this threshold, the user is accepted; otherwise, they are rejected."
Define a False Positive in authentication systems.,A False Positive in authentication systems occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user. This represents a significant security problem because an unauthorized individual gains access.
What is the security implication of a False Positive?,"The security implication of a False Positive is that it leads to the acceptance of a wrong, unauthorized user. This constitutes a security problem as it bypasses the authentication mechanism and grants access to someone who should not have it."
Define a False Negative in authentication systems.,A False Negative in authentication systems occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. This means an authorized individual is denied access.
What are the consequences of a False Negative for a legitimate user?,"The consequences of a False Negative for a legitimate user are that it creates embarrassment and leads to an inefficient work environment. The legitimate user is denied access, causing frustration and hindering productivity."
How are user features compared to reference features for authentication?,"For authentication, the system measures the similarity between the user's current features and their stored reference features. If this measured similarity is above a predefined threshold, the user is accepted."
Are fingerprints and biometric traits truly secret?,"No, fingerprints and biometric traits are generally not secrets, even though they may be unique. This implies that while they are distinct to an individual, they can potentially be acquired or replicated by others."
Describe the nature of fingerprints and biometric traits regarding uniqueness.,"Fingerprints and biometric traits are generally unique to an individual. However, despite their uniqueness, they are not considered secrets, meaning they can be obtained or reproduced, posing a security challenge."

What precautions are necessary when authenticating remote users to counteract rubber finger fraud?,"When authenticating remote users, additional precautions have to be taken to counteract the type of fraud involving rubber fingers. This implies that without physical presence and oversight, remote biometric authentication is more vulnerable and requires enhanced security measures."
Why is secure storage of biometric data important?,"Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement from the angle of personal privacy protection. Protecting this data ensures that sensitive personal information, such as fingerprints, is not compromised or misused."
From what perspective is secure storage of biometric data a requirement?,Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement from the perspective of personal privacy protection. This emphasizes the need to safeguard sensitive personal information stored as biometric identifiers.
What is the primary characteristic of a passphrase that makes it easy for users to remember?,"The primary characteristic of a passphrase that makes it easy for users to remember is that it consists of sentences or long phrases. These are generally more natural and memorable than complex, arbitrary strings of characters typically found in traditional passwords."
How do visual drawing patterns differ from traditional alphanumeric passwords?,"Visual drawing patterns differ from traditional alphanumeric passwords in their input method and interface. While alphanumeric passwords require typing characters, visual drawing patterns involve drawing a specific gesture or shape on a touch interface, making them a more graphical and interactive authentication method."
What specific types of attacks are further measures in combined password file protection designed to slow down?,Further measures in combined password file protection are specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks. A dictionary attack involves systematically trying common words or phrases as passwords to gain unauthorized access.
"What would happen if an attacker gained write access to a password file, even if it's cryptographically protected?","If an attacker gained write access to a password file, even if it's cryptographically protected, they could change the passwords of other users. This would allow them to gain access to the data of those users, bypassing the cryptographic protection by altering the stored credentials directly."
"Why can a password file containing ""encrypted"" passwords still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks if unprivileged users need access?","A password file containing \""encrypted\"" passwords can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks if unprivileged users need access because the \""encryption\"" likely refers to hashing, which is a one-way function. Attackers can pre-compute hashes of common dictionary words and compare them against the stored hashes in the file, even if they cannot decrypt the original passwords. The need for unprivileged users to access some data in the file might expose these hashes."
What is the general process for determining user acceptance based on features?,"The general process for determining user acceptance based on features involves two steps: first, measuring the similarity between the user's current features and their reference features; and second, accepting the user if this measured similarity is above a predefined threshold."
What is the primary concern when a system produces a False Positive?,"The primary concern when a system produces a False Positive is a security problem, as it means the system incorrectly accepts a wrong, unauthorized user, granting them access they should not have."
What specific event in September 2013 highlighted the vulnerability of fingerprints?,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated how to lift fingerprints from an \""iPhone 5s\"", which specifically highlighted the vulnerability of fingerprints as a biometric authentication method."
"What is the main challenge with authenticating remote users when considering ""rubber finger"" fraud?","The main challenge with authenticating remote users when considering \""rubber finger\"" fraud is the need for additional precautions. Without the physical presence of security personnel, it is harder to detect and counteract this type of fraud, making remote authentication more vulnerable."
What is the overall goal of protecting the password file?,"The overall goal of protecting the password file is to prevent attackers from compromising its confidentiality or integrity. This ensures that user names and passwords stored within the file remain secure and unaltered, safeguarding user accounts and data."
