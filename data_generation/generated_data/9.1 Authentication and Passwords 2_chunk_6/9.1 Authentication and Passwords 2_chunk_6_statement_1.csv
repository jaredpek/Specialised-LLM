List the alternative forms of passwords mentioned in the document.,"The document mentions four alternative forms of passwords:\n1.  **Passphrase**: Users enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size passwords.\n2.  **Visual drawing patterns**: These are used on touch interfaces, for example, in Android operating systems.\n3.  **Picture passwords**: Users select objects in pictures and patterns to authenticate. This method is used in Windows 8.\n4.  **One-time passwords**: These are passwords that are valid for only one login session or transaction."
Explain what a passphrase is and how it functions as an alternative password form.,"A **passphrase** is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy for them to remember. The system then takes this input and applies a **hash function** to compute the actual password, which is of a fixed size. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size, often called a ""hash value"" or ""hash."" This process transforms the user's memorable phrase into a secure, fixed-length password for authentication."
Describe visual drawing patterns as an alternative password method.,Visual drawing patterns are an alternative password method primarily used on touch interfaces. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on the screen. An example of where this method is employed is the Android operating system.
What are picture passwords and in which operating system are they used?,Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects within pictures and patterns to gain access. This method was notably used in Windows 8.
Define one-time passwords.,"One-time passwords are an alternative form of password that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are designed to be used once and then become invalid, enhancing security by preventing replay attacks."
What is the primary concern regarding the password file maintained by an operating system?,"The primary concern regarding the password file, which an operating system maintains with user names and passwords, is that an attacker could try to compromise its confidentiality or integrity. **Confidentiality** refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, while **integrity** refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data."
List the options for protecting the password file.,"The options for protecting the password file are:\n1.  **Cryptographic protection**: This involves using encryption and other cryptographic techniques to secure the password data.\n2.  **Access control enforced by the operating system**: This means setting permissions and restrictions on who can access or modify the password file, managed by the operating system.\n3.  **Combination of cryptographic protection and access control**: This approach combines both cryptographic measures and operating system-enforced access controls, possibly with further measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks."
Explain cryptographic protection in the context of password file security.,"Cryptographic protection, in the context of password file security, refers to the use of encryption and other cryptographic techniques to secure the data within the password file. This helps to protect the confidentiality of the passwords, making them unreadable to unauthorized individuals even if they gain access to the file."
How does access control enforced by the operating system contribute to password file protection?,"Access control enforced by the operating system contributes to password file protection by setting permissions and restrictions that dictate which users or processes can access or modify the password file. This mechanism ensures that only authorized entities, typically privileged users, can interact with the file, thereby preventing unauthorized access and potential compromise of its contents."
What is a dictionary attack and how can it be mitigated when protecting password files?,"A **dictionary attack** is a method of attempting to break into a password-protected computer system or service by systematically trying every word in a dictionary as a password. When protecting password files, dictionary attacks can be mitigated by using a combination of cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures specifically designed to slow down such attacks. These additional measures might include rate limiting failed login attempts or adding computational complexity to password verification."
What is the primary rule for write access to the password file according to access control settings?,"According to access control settings, the primary rule for write access to the password file is that only **privileged users** must have write access. A **privileged user** is an account with elevated permissions, typically an administrator or root user, capable of making system-wide changes."
Why is it crucial that only privileged users have write access to the password file?,"It is crucial that only privileged users have write access to the password file because, otherwise, an attacker could gain access to the data of other users simply by changing their password. This vulnerability exists even if the password file itself is protected by cryptographic means, as changing the password would bypass the need to decrypt the original password."
"Under what condition could passwords theoretically be stored unencrypted, regarding read access?","Passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted if read access to the password file is strictly restricted to only privileged users. In such a scenario, the assumption is that only trusted system administrators would be able to view the file's contents, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure."
"If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, what measure must be taken, and what is a potential vulnerability?","If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be ""encrypted."" However, even with this measure, such a file can still be used in **dictionary attacks**. This implies that while the passwords are obfuscated, the encryption method might be susceptible to brute-force attempts using common words or phrases."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems protect the actual password file from non-privileged users by hiding it in a specific location: `/etc/shadow`. This file is configured such that it is not accessible to non-privileged users, thereby restricting read access to sensitive password information."
Describe the two steps involved in user acceptance based on feature similarity.,"The two steps involved in user acceptance based on feature similarity are:\n1.  **Measure similarity**: The system first measures the similarity between the reference features (stored during enrollment) and the current features (provided during authentication).\n2.  **Acceptance based on threshold**: The user is accepted if the measured similarity between the reference and current features is above a predefined threshold. A **predefined threshold** is a specific value set in advance, which acts as a boundary or limit for comparison."
Define a 'False Positive' in the context of user authentication failure rates.,"In the context of user authentication failure rates, a **False Positive** occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user. This represents a significant security problem because an unauthorized individual gains access to the system."
Define a 'False Negative' in the context of user authentication failure rates.,"In the context of user authentication failure rates, a **False Negative** occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. This creates embarrassment for the user and contributes to an inefficient work environment, as authorized individuals are denied access."
What are the consequences of a False Positive in an authentication system?,"The consequence of a False Positive in an authentication system is a **security problem**. This occurs when the system accepts a wrong user, meaning an unauthorized individual gains access, potentially compromising data or system integrity."
What are the consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system?,"The consequences of a False Negative in an authentication system are that it creates embarrassment for the legitimate user who is rejected and leads to an inefficient work environment, as authorized individuals are unable to access necessary resources."
Are fingerprints and biometric traits truly unique and secret?,"Fingerprints and biometric traits, while generally unique, are stated to be ""no secrets."" This implies that while they might be distinct to an individual, they are not inherently private or uncompromisable."

Protecting this data ensures that sensitive personal information, such as fingerprints, is not exposed or misused, safeguarding an individual's privacy."
What is a hash function as it relates to passphrases?,"In relation to passphrases, a **hash function** is a computational algorithm that the system applies to the user's entered sentence or long phrase. Its purpose is to compute a fixed-size actual password from the variable-length passphrase, transforming the input into a standardized, secure format for authentication."
How does the operating system's role in maintaining a password file relate to security risks?,"The operating system's role in maintaining a file with user names and passwords directly relates to security risks because this file is a prime target for attackers. An attacker could attempt to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of this file, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of user accounts."
What is the purpose of combining cryptographic protection and access control for password files?,"The purpose of combining cryptographic protection and access control for password files is to create a more robust security posture. Cryptographic protection secures the data itself, while access control restricts who can interact with the file. This combination, possibly with further measures, aims to enhance security and specifically slow down dictionary attacks, making it harder for attackers to compromise passwords."
"Why would an attacker want to change another user's password, even if it's cryptographically protected?","An attacker would want to change another user's password, even if it's cryptographically protected, to gain unauthorized access to that user's data. If the attacker has write access to the password file, they can simply alter the password, bypassing the cryptographic protection of the original password and effectively taking over the account."
What is the significance of the `/etc/shadow` file in Unix/Linux systems for password security?,"The significance of the `/etc/shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems for password security is that it hides the actual password file. By making this file inaccessible to non-privileged users, it prevents unauthorized individuals from reading sensitive password data, even if they gain some level of access to the system."
How does a predefined threshold function in biometric authentication?,"In biometric authentication, a **predefined threshold** functions as a critical decision point. After measuring the similarity between a user's current biometric features and their stored reference features, the system compares this similarity score against the threshold. If the score is above this predefined value, the user is accepted; otherwise, they are rejected."
What is the core principle behind biometric authentication as described in the document?,"The core principle behind biometric authentication, as described in the document, involves measuring the similarity between a user's current biometric features and their previously stored reference features. If this measured similarity exceeds a predefined threshold, the user is accepted."
What is the main challenge that 'rubber fingers' present to commercial fingerprint recognition systems?,"The main challenge that 'rubber fingers' present to commercial fingerprint recognition systems is their ability to defeat many of these systems. This means that these artificial replicas can be successfully used to bypass the authentication process, leading to unauthorized access."
Why is personal privacy protection relevant to the storage of biometric data?,"Personal privacy protection is highly relevant to the storage of biometric data because biometric data, such as fingerprints, are unique identifiers tied directly to an individual. Secure storage is essential to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure of this sensitive personal information, which could lead to identity theft or other privacy violations."
What is the general characteristic of fingerprints and biometric traits regarding their uniqueness?,"The general characteristic of fingerprints and biometric traits regarding their uniqueness is that they ""may be unique."" However, the document also clarifies that despite their potential uniqueness, they are ""no secrets,"" implying they are not inherently private or immune to compromise."
What does 'compromise the confidentiality or integrity' mean in the context of a password file?,"To 'compromise the confidentiality or integrity' of a password file means to either gain unauthorized access to the sensitive information within it (confidentiality) or to alter or corrupt the data in an unauthorized manner (integrity). **Confidentiality** ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access, while **integrity** ensures that information is accurate and complete and has not been tampered with."
How can measures to slow down dictionary attacks be incorporated into password file protection?,"Measures to slow down dictionary attacks can be incorporated into password file protection as part of a combined strategy involving cryptographic protection and access control. These measures are additional safeguards designed to increase the time and computational effort an attacker needs to try multiple passwords, making dictionary attacks less feasible or more detectable."
What is the implication of fingerprints being 'no secrets'?,"The implication of fingerprints being 'no secrets' is that despite their uniqueness, they are not inherently private or uncompromisable. This means that methods exist, or can be developed, to obtain and replicate fingerprints, as demonstrated by hackers lifting fingerprints from devices like the iPhone 5s and Samsung S5."
What is the role of security personnel in mitigating 'rubber finger' fraud?,"The role of security personnel in mitigating 'rubber finger' fraud is to provide human oversight during authentication. Their presence can help detect and prevent the use of forged biometric samples, making the issue of 'rubber fingers' a minor concern in such supervised authentication scenarios."
Why are additional precautions necessary for remote users when dealing with 'rubber finger' fraud?,"Additional precautions are necessary for remote users when dealing with 'rubber finger' fraud because remote authentication environments typically lack the physical presence of security personnel. Without this human oversight, it becomes easier for attackers to use forged biometric samples, necessitating stronger digital or procedural safeguards to counteract this type of fraud."
What is the general purpose of alternative forms of passwords?,"The general purpose of alternative forms of passwords is to provide different methods for user authentication beyond traditional alphanumeric passwords. These alternatives, such as passphrases, visual drawing patterns, picture passwords, and one-time passwords, aim to offer potentially easier-to-remember or more secure authentication experiences."
How does the concept of 'write access' relate to the security of the password file?,"The concept of 'write access' is directly related to the security of the password file because unauthorized write access allows an attacker to modify the file's contents. Specifically, if an attacker gains write access, they could change other users' passwords, thereby compromising their accounts, even if the original passwords were cryptographically protected."
"What is the potential risk if read access to the password file is not restricted to privileged users, even if passwords are 'encrypted'?","If read access to the password file is not restricted to privileged users, even if passwords are ""encrypted,"" the potential risk is that the file can still be used in **dictionary attacks**. This means that an attacker could obtain the ""encrypted"" password data and then systematically try to decrypt it using common words or phrases, eventually compromising user accounts."
What is the difference between a False Positive and a False Negative in authentication?,"The difference between a **False Positive** and a **False Negative** in authentication lies in the outcome of an incorrect decision. A **False Positive** occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong user, leading to a security problem. In contrast, a **False Negative** occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user, causing embarrassment and an inefficient work environment."
How does the system compute actual passwords from passphrases?,"The system computes actual passwords from passphrases by applying a **hash function** to the sentences or long phrases entered by the user. This hash function transforms the variable-length passphrase into a fixed-size output, which serves as the actual password for authentication."
What is the role of the operating system in enforcing access control for the password file?,"The operating system plays a crucial role in enforcing access control for the password file by managing permissions and restrictions. It determines which users or processes are authorized to read, write, or execute operations on the password file, thereby protecting its confidentiality and integrity from unauthorized access."
Why is it important to define a 'predefined threshold' in biometric authentication?,"It is important to define a 'predefined threshold' in biometric authentication because it establishes the minimum level of similarity required between reference features and current features for a user to be accepted. This threshold acts as a critical decision boundary, balancing security (avoiding False Positives) and usability (avoiding False Negatives)."
What kind of attacks are specifically mentioned as being slowed down by certain password file protection measures?,"The kind of attacks specifically mentioned as being slowed down by certain password file protection measures are **dictionary attacks**. This is achieved through a combination of cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures designed to increase the difficulty and time required for such attacks."
What is the primary goal of protecting the password file?,The primary goal of protecting the password file is to prevent an attacker from compromising its confidentiality or integrity. This ensures that user names and passwords stored within the file remain secure from unauthorized disclosure or alteration.
