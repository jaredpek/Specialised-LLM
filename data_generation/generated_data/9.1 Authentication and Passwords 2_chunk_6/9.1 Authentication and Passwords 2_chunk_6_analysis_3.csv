"Analyse the concept of a 'Passphrase' as an alternative form of password, including its mechanism.","A Passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual passwords, which are of a fixed size. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string, which is the 'hash value' or 'digest'. This process is typically one-way, meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function to get the original input."
Describe 'Visual drawing patterns' as an alternative password method and provide an example of its usage.,Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password primarily used on touch interfaces. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on the screen. An example of where this method is used is the Android operating system.
"Explain 'Picture passwords' as an alternative authentication method, including its operational principle and a common platform where it's used.",Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns to log in. This method requires the user to remember a sequence of selections on a chosen image. It was notably used in Windows 8.
What is a 'One-time password' in the context of alternative password forms?,"A One-time password (OTP) is an alternative form of password that is valid for only one login session or transaction. This means that once used, the password cannot be used again, enhancing security by preventing replay attacks."
"What is the primary function of the operating system regarding user authentication data, and what is the main threat to this data?","The operating system maintains a file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. The main threat to this file is an attacker attempting to compromise its confidentiality or integrity. **Confidentiality** refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, while **integrity** refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data, preventing unauthorized modification."
Identify and describe the three main options for protecting a password file.,"The three main options for protecting a password file are: \n1.  **Cryptographic protection:** This involves using encryption algorithms to secure the password data, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key. \n2.  **Access control enforced by the operating system:** This involves setting permissions and restrictions on who can access the password file and what operations they can perform (e.g., read, write). \n3.  **Combination of cryptographic protection and access control:** This approach leverages both encryption and access control mechanisms for enhanced security. It may also include further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
Explain the role of cryptographic protection in securing password files.,"Cryptographic protection is an option for securing password files by encrypting the data within them. **Cryptographic protection** involves using encryption algorithms to transform the password data into an unreadable format (ciphertext), which can only be converted back to its original readable form (plaintext) with a specific key. This prevents unauthorized parties from accessing the actual passwords even if they gain access to the file."
How does access control enforced by the operating system contribute to password file protection?,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by regulating which users or processes can access the file and what operations they are permitted to perform. **Access control** is a security mechanism that determines and enforces who is allowed to access resources and what actions they can perform on those resources. By restricting access, the operating system prevents unauthorized entities from reading, modifying, or deleting the password file."
Discuss the benefits of combining cryptographic protection and access control for password file security.,"Combining cryptographic protection and access control offers a robust defense for password files. Cryptographic protection encrypts the data, making it unreadable without a key, while access control restricts who can even attempt to access the encrypted file. This dual layer of security makes it significantly harder for attackers. Furthermore, this combined approach can include additional measures specifically designed to slow down **dictionary attacks**, which are attempts to break into a password-protected computer system by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password."
"What is the critical access control setting for the password file concerning write permissions, and why is it important?","Only privileged users must have write access to the password file. This is critical because if write access is not restricted to **privileged users** (users with elevated permissions, typically administrators), an attacker could gain access to the data of other users simply by changing their password. This vulnerability exists even if the password file itself is protected by cryptographic means, as the attacker could overwrite the encrypted password with a new, known encrypted password."
"Under what specific condition could passwords theoretically be stored unencrypted, according to access control principles?","Passwords could theoretically be stored unencrypted if read access to the password file is strictly restricted to privileged users. In this scenario, only authorized administrators would be able to view the file's contents, minimizing the risk of unauthorized disclosure. However, this is generally not recommended due to other potential vulnerabilities."
"If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, what security measure must be taken, and what is a persistent vulnerability?","If a password file contains data required by unprivileged users, the passwords must be ""encrypted."" However, even with this encryption, such a file can still be used in **dictionary attacks**. This implies that the 'encryption' might refer to hashing or a reversible encryption scheme that, if compromised, still allows for brute-force attempts against the hashed or encrypted values using common words or phrases."
How do modern Unix/Linux systems enhance the security of the actual password file?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems enhance the security of the actual password file by hiding it in a specific location, typically `/etc/shadow`. This file is configured to be inaccessible to non-privileged users, meaning only system administrators or processes with elevated permissions can read or modify its contents. This restriction significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and dictionary attacks by regular users."
Describe the two main steps involved in determining user acceptance based on feature similarity in an authentication system.,"The two main steps involved in determining user acceptance based on feature similarity are: \n1.  **Measure similarity between reference features and current features:** The system compares the features provided by the user during an authentication attempt (current features) against a stored set of authorized features (reference features). \n2.  **User is accepted if match is above a predefined threshold:** If the measured similarity score exceeds a specific, predetermined level, the user is accepted as legitimate. This **predefined threshold** is a critical parameter that balances security and usability."
Define 'False Positive' in the context of authentication failure rates and explain its consequence.,"A **False Positive** in authentication occurs when the system incorrectly accepts a wrong or unauthorized user. The consequence of a False Positive is a significant security problem, as it grants access to an entity that should have been denied, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or system compromise."
Define 'False Negative' in the context of authentication failure rates and explain its consequence.,"A **False Negative** in authentication occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. The consequence of a False Negative is that it creates embarrassment for the legitimate user and leads to an inefficient work environment, as the authorized user is prevented from accessing necessary resources."
What is the general characteristic of fingerprints and biometric traits regarding their secrecy?,"In general, fingerprints and biometric traits may be unique to an individual, but they are considered to be ""no secrets."" This means that while they can identify a person, they are not inherently private or difficult to obtain by malicious actors, making them vulnerable to various forms of spoofing or theft."
Provide an example of a real-world vulnerability demonstrated by hackers concerning fingerprints from mobile devices.,"In September 2013, hackers demonstrated a real-world vulnerability by showing how to lift fingerprints from an iPhone 5s. Similar attacks were also applicable to the Samsung S5 phone, highlighting that even advanced biometric systems can be compromised by sophisticated methods of fingerprint acquisition."
Explain the issue of 'Rubber Fingers' in the context of fingerprint recognition systems.,"The issue of 'Rubber Fingers' refers to the use of fake or replicated fingerprints, often made from materials like rubber or gelatin, to bypass biometric authentication systems. These 'rubber fingers' have successfully defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems in the past, demonstrating a significant vulnerability."
"When is the issue of 'Rubber Fingers' considered a minor problem, and when does it require additional precautions?","The issue of 'Rubber Fingers' is considered a minor problem if authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel, as they can visually verify the user and detect attempts at fraud. However, when authenticating remote users, additional precautions have to be taken to counteract this type of fraud, as there is no physical oversight to verify the user's identity."
Why is secure storage of biometric data considered an important requirement?,"Secure storage of biometric data is an important requirement primarily from the angle of personal privacy protection. If biometric data, such as fingerprints, is compromised or accessed without authorization, it can lead to significant privacy breaches, as these unique identifiers cannot be easily changed like passwords."
What specific type of attack can be slowed down by combining cryptographic protection and access control for password files?,"The combination of cryptographic protection and access control, along with further measures, can be used to slow down **dictionary attacks**. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer system by systematically trying every word in an exhaustive list (dictionary) of possible passwords."
"Discuss the implications of an attacker gaining write access to a password file, even if it's protected by cryptographic means.","If an attacker gains write access to a password file, even if it is protected by cryptographic means, they could still compromise the data of other users. This is because the attacker could change other users' passwords to values they know, effectively taking over those accounts. The cryptographic protection would prevent them from reading the *original* passwords, but not from overwriting them with new, attacker-chosen ones."
What is the primary purpose of hiding the actual password file in `/etc/shadow` in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"The primary purpose of hiding the actual password file in `/etc/shadow` in modern Unix/Linux systems is to enhance security by making it inaccessible to non-privileged users. This prevents unauthorized users from even attempting to read or perform dictionary attacks directly on the stored password hashes, thereby protecting the confidentiality of user authentication data."
Compare and contrast 'False Positive' and 'False Negative' authentication outcomes.,"A **False Positive** occurs when an authentication system incorrectly accepts an unauthorized user, leading to a security problem. In contrast, a **False Negative** occurs when the system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user, resulting in embarrassment and an inefficient work environment. Both are undesirable outcomes, but a False Positive poses a direct security risk, while a False Negative primarily impacts usability and productivity."
How do 'Passphrases' differ from traditional fixed-size actual passwords in their input and processing?,"Passphrases differ from traditional fixed-size actual passwords in their input, as users enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. In terms of processing, the system applies a **hash function** to these longer inputs to compute the fixed-size actual passwords that are stored and used for authentication. Traditional passwords are typically shorter and directly stored or hashed without an intermediate 'phrase' input."
What is the significance of a 'predefined threshold' in the context of user authentication based on feature similarity?,"A 'predefined threshold' is a crucial parameter in user authentication based on feature similarity. It is a specific value that the measured similarity between reference features and current features must exceed for a user to be accepted. This threshold determines the sensitivity of the authentication system, balancing the rates of False Positives and False Negatives. A higher threshold increases security but may lead to more False Negatives, while a lower threshold improves convenience but may increase False Positives."
Discuss the privacy implications associated with the general characteristic of fingerprints being 'no secrets'.,"The characteristic of fingerprints being 'no secrets' has significant privacy implications. It means that despite their uniqueness, fingerprints can be acquired without an individual's explicit consent or knowledge from various surfaces. This vulnerability, demonstrated by incidents like hackers lifting prints from iPhones, implies that biometric data, once compromised, cannot be easily changed, unlike a password. This raises concerns about long-term identity theft and unauthorized tracking if such data is not securely managed."
What measures are necessary to counteract 'Rubber Fingers' fraud when authenticating remote users?,"When authenticating remote users, additional precautions are necessary to counteract 'Rubber Fingers' fraud. Since there is no physical presence of security personnel to verify the user, these precautions might include multi-factor authentication, liveness detection technologies (to ensure the biometric sample comes from a living person), or other challenge-response mechanisms that are difficult for a forged fingerprint to satisfy."
"Why is the integrity of the password file crucial, and what could an attacker do if it's compromised?","The integrity of the password file is crucial because it ensures that the data (usernames and passwords) has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. If an attacker compromises the integrity of the password file, they could modify existing passwords, add new unauthorized user accounts, or delete legitimate accounts, thereby gaining unauthorized access or disrupting system operations. **Integrity** refers to the assurance that information is accurate and complete, and has not been tampered with."
Explain how 'Visual drawing patterns' and 'Picture passwords' are similar in their interaction method but differ in their specific input.,"'Visual drawing patterns' and 'Picture passwords' are similar in that both rely on a visual, interactive method for authentication, typically on a touch interface. However, they differ in their specific input: 'Visual drawing patterns' involve drawing a continuous pattern or gesture, while 'Picture passwords' require selecting specific objects or points within a static image in a particular sequence."
What is the primary security advantage of using 'One-time passwords'?,"The primary security advantage of using 'One-time passwords' (OTPs) is that they are valid for only a single login session or transaction. This significantly reduces the risk of replay attacks, where an attacker intercepts a password and attempts to reuse it later. Even if an OTP is intercepted, it becomes useless after its first use, making it a more secure alternative than static passwords."
How does the operating system's role in maintaining a password file relate to the need for its protection?,"The operating system's role in maintaining a file with user names and passwords directly necessitates its protection. Since this file contains sensitive authentication credentials, it becomes a prime target for attackers. Therefore, the OS must implement robust protection mechanisms to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of this critical data against potential compromise."
What is the consequence of a system accepting a wrong user due to a 'False Positive'?,"The consequence of a system accepting a wrong user due to a 'False Positive' is a significant security problem. This unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, system compromise, or malicious activities being performed under the guise of a legitimate user, undermining the entire security posture of the system."
Why is it important for the password file to be inaccessible to non-privileged users in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"It is important for the password file (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) to be inaccessible to non-privileged users in modern Unix/Linux systems to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the attack surface. If non-privileged users could access this file, they might be able to extract hashed passwords and attempt offline dictionary or brute-force attacks, even if the passwords are 'encrypted'."
"Discuss the security implications of fingerprints being susceptible to lifting, as demonstrated by the iPhone 5s incident.","The susceptibility of fingerprints to lifting, as demonstrated by the iPhone 5s incident, implies that physical access to a device or even surfaces touched by a user can lead to the compromise of biometric authentication. This means that fingerprints, unlike passwords, cannot be easily changed once compromised, making such attacks a long-term security risk for individuals whose biometric data has been acquired."
What is the primary concern regarding personal privacy protection when it comes to biometric data?,"The primary concern regarding personal privacy protection when it comes to biometric data is the need for its secure storage. Biometric data, being unique and immutable identifiers, if compromised or leaked, can lead to irreversible privacy breaches and potential identity theft, as individuals cannot simply 'change' their fingerprints or other biometric traits."
"How does the concept of 'no secrets' apply to biometric traits like fingerprints, and what does it imply for their security?","The concept of 'no secrets' applied to biometric traits like fingerprints means that while they are unique, they are not inherently private or difficult for malicious actors to obtain. This implies that relying solely on fingerprints for security is risky, as they can be lifted or replicated. Therefore, additional security measures, such as liveness detection or multi-factor authentication, are crucial to ensure robust security."
What is a 'privileged user' in the context of access control settings for a password file?,"A **privileged user** in the context of access control settings for a password file refers to a user account that has elevated permissions or administrative rights within the operating system. These users are granted special access, such as write access to critical system files like the password file, which is typically denied to regular, non-privileged users."
"Why is it generally not advisable to store passwords unencrypted, even if read access is restricted to privileged users?","Even if read access is restricted to privileged users, it is generally not advisable to store passwords unencrypted due to potential vulnerabilities. A privileged user's account could be compromised, or the system itself could be exploited, leading to unauthorized access to the unencrypted passwords. This would expose all user credentials directly, creating a severe security breach."
What is a 'dictionary attack' and how does it relate to password file security?,"A **dictionary attack** is a method of attempting to break into a password-protected computer system by systematically trying every word in a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, or previously leaked passwords (a 'dictionary'). It relates to password file security because even 'encrypted' password files, if accessible, can be subjected to dictionary attacks against the hashed or encrypted password values to reveal the original passwords."
How does the use of a hash function in 'Passphrases' contribute to security?,"The use of a hash function in 'Passphrases' contributes to security by transforming the user's easy-to-remember long phrase into a fixed-size actual password. This means the original passphrase is never stored directly, and the one-way nature of a **hash function** makes it computationally infeasible to reverse the process to retrieve the original passphrase from the stored hash. This protects the passphrase even if the hashed password file is compromised."
What are the primary differences between 'Visual drawing patterns' and 'One-time passwords' as authentication methods?,"'Visual drawing patterns' and 'One-time passwords' differ significantly. 'Visual drawing patterns' are a form of biometric or behavioral authentication used on touch interfaces, relying on a user's remembered pattern. In contrast, 'One-time passwords' are alphanumeric codes valid for a single use, typically generated by an external device or application, and do not rely on visual interaction or patterns for input."
Explain how the 'fixed-size actual passwords' are generated from a passphrase.,"The 'fixed-size actual passwords' are generated from a passphrase by applying a **hash function**. The user's input, which is a sentence or long phrase, is fed into this hash function. The hash function then processes this input and produces a unique, fixed-length string of characters, regardless of the length of the original passphrase. This fixed-size output is the actual password used for authentication and storage."
What is the main advantage of 'Picture passwords' over traditional text-based passwords for users?,"The main advantage of 'Picture passwords' over traditional text-based passwords for users is that they can be easier to remember. Instead of recalling a complex string of characters, users select objects in pictures and patterns, which can be more intuitive and memorable, potentially leading to stronger 'passwords' that are less prone to being forgotten or written down."
Why is it important to have 'further measures to slow down dictionary attacks' when protecting password files?,"It is important to have 'further measures to slow down dictionary attacks' because even with cryptographic protection and access control, password hashes can still be vulnerable if an attacker obtains them. Measures like salting, key stretching (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt), and rate limiting login attempts make it computationally more expensive and time-consuming for attackers to test a large number of potential passwords against the stored hashes, thereby increasing the security of the system."
What is the consequence of a 'False Negative' for a legitimate user and the work environment?,"The consequence of a 'False Negative' for a legitimate user is that they are incorrectly rejected by the authentication system, leading to embarrassment. For the work environment, it creates inefficiency because the authorized user is prevented from accessing necessary resources or systems, disrupting their workflow and potentially causing delays."
"How do hackers typically 'lift' fingerprints, as demonstrated in the iPhone 5s incident?","Hackers typically 'lift' fingerprints by obtaining latent prints left on surfaces, such as a smartphone screen. They then use various techniques, often involving photography and specialized software, to enhance and reproduce these prints into a usable form, such as a 'rubber finger' or a digital image, which can then be used to bypass biometric authentication systems."
What is the primary difference between 'privileged users' and 'non-privileged users' in the context of password file access?,"The primary difference between 'privileged users' and 'non-privileged users' in the context of password file access lies in their assigned permissions. **Privileged users** (e.g., administrators) have elevated rights, allowing them to perform sensitive operations like writing to or reading the password file. **Non-privileged users** (e.g., regular users) have restricted rights, preventing them from accessing or modifying critical system files like the password file, thereby enhancing system security."
Discuss the security implications of 'Rubber Fingers' having defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems.,"The fact that 'Rubber Fingers' have defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems implies a significant vulnerability in these systems' ability to distinguish between a live, legitimate finger and a sophisticated replica. This highlights the need for advanced liveness detection technologies and multi-factor authentication to bolster the security of biometric systems, especially in environments where physical access to the sensor is possible."
What kind of data does the operating system's password file typically contain?,The operating system's password file typically contains user names and their corresponding passwords. These passwords are usually stored in a hashed or encrypted form rather than in plaintext to enhance security.
How does restricting write access to the password file prevent an attacker from compromising other users' data?,"Restricting write access to the password file to only privileged users prevents an attacker from compromising other users' data by denying them the ability to modify the file. If an attacker cannot write to the password file, they cannot change other users' passwords, even if they manage to bypass cryptographic protection, thus safeguarding the integrity of user accounts."
What is the general principle behind user acceptance in an authentication system based on feature similarity?,"The general principle behind user acceptance in an authentication system based on feature similarity is a comparison process. The system measures the degree of resemblance between the features presented by the user during authentication and the stored reference features. If this measured similarity surpasses a predetermined threshold, the user is accepted as legitimate."
Why is the confidentiality of the password file important?,"The confidentiality of the password file is important because it contains sensitive user authentication credentials. Protecting its confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals cannot access or view the stored passwords (or their hashes), preventing potential identity theft, unauthorized account access, and other security breaches. **Confidentiality** is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes."
What is the primary difference in usage context between 'Visual drawing patterns' and 'Picture passwords'?,"The primary difference in usage context between 'Visual drawing patterns' and 'Picture passwords' is that 'Visual drawing patterns' are typically used on touch interfaces, as exemplified by Android, where a user draws a pattern. 'Picture passwords', on the other hand, involve selecting objects in static pictures and patterns, as seen in Windows 8, which can be used with various input methods beyond just touch."
How does the concept of 'no secrets' for fingerprints impact the design of secure authentication systems?,"The concept of 'no secrets' for fingerprints significantly impacts the design of secure authentication systems by necessitating that fingerprints should not be the sole factor for authentication. Systems must incorporate additional layers of security, such as liveness detection, multi-factor authentication, or robust anti-spoofing measures, to compensate for the inherent vulnerability of fingerprints being reproducible or acquirable."
What is the main purpose of 'access control enforced by the operating system' in protecting the password file?,"The main purpose of 'access control enforced by the operating system' in protecting the password file is to regulate and restrict who can access the file and what operations they can perform on it. This mechanism ensures that only authorized users or processes, typically privileged ones, can interact with the sensitive password data, thereby preventing unauthorized reading, modification, or deletion."
Explain the term 'reference features' in the context of user authentication.,"In the context of user authentication, 'reference features' refer to the authenticated, stored biometric or behavioral data of a legitimate user. These features are captured during enrollment and serve as the baseline against which current features, provided during an authentication attempt, are compared to verify the user's identity."
What is the risk if a password file containing data for unprivileged users is not 'encrypted'?,"If a password file containing data required by unprivileged users is not 'encrypted', the risk is that the actual passwords could be directly exposed if the file's access controls are bypassed or if an attacker gains read access. This would allow attackers to immediately compromise user accounts without needing to perform dictionary attacks or brute-force attempts against hashed values."
How does the inaccessibility of `/etc/shadow` to non-privileged users contribute to slowing down dictionary attacks?,"The inaccessibility of `/etc/shadow` to non-privileged users contributes to slowing down dictionary attacks by preventing attackers from obtaining the hashed passwords in the first place. Without direct access to the hash file, an attacker cannot perform offline dictionary attacks, which are typically much faster than online attacks that are subject to rate limiting and account lockout policies."
What is the primary difference between 'Passphrase' and 'One-time passwords'?,"The primary difference between 'Passphrase' and 'One-time passwords' lies in their nature and usage. A 'Passphrase' is a static, user-remembered long phrase that is hashed to produce a fixed-size password for repeated use. A 'One-time password' is a dynamic, typically short, alphanumeric code that is valid for only a single authentication attempt and cannot be reused, offering enhanced protection against replay attacks."
Why is 'secure storage of biometric data' crucial for personal privacy?,"'Secure storage of biometric data' is crucial for personal privacy because biometric identifiers are unique and permanent to an individual. Unlike passwords, they cannot be easily changed if compromised. If biometric data is not stored securely, its unauthorized access or leakage could lead to irreversible identity theft, tracking, or other privacy violations that are difficult to mitigate."
