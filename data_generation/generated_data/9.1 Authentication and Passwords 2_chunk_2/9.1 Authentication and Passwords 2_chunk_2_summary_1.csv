Provide a comprehensive summary of how password hashes are stored in different operating systems.,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a password file. In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"". In Unix systems, this was traditionally in ""/etc/passwd"", but in modern Unix/Linux systems, it is stored in the `shadow` file, specifically at ""/etc/shadow"". The `SAM file` is a database file in Windows that stores local user account information, including hashed passwords. The `/etc/passwd` file in Unix-like systems traditionally stored user account information, including password hashes, though modern systems moved hashes to `/etc/shadow` for security. The `shadow file` (`/etc/shadow`) is a file in Unix-like operating systems that stores secure user account information, including encrypted passwords, to enhance security by making password hashes inaccessible to non-privileged users."
Summarise the temporary storage locations for passwords at the application level and the associated risks.,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or a web page (it is explicitly advised not to save passwords in cache!). `Buffers` are temporary data storage areas used to hold data while it is being transferred from one place to another. `Caches` are hardware or software components that store data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. The management of these temporary storage locations is typically beyond the control of the user, which means a password might be retained for a longer duration than the user intends or is aware of, increasing the risk of exposure."
Can you summarise the key differences in password hash storage between Windows and Unix/Linux systems?,"In Windows systems, password hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"". Conversely, in Unix systems, password hashes were historically stored in ""/etc/passwd"", but in modern Unix/Linux systems, they are stored in the more secure `shadow file`, found at ""/etc/shadow"". The `SAM file` is a database in Windows that holds local user account data, including hashed passwords. The `shadow file` is a critical system file in Unix-like operating systems that stores encrypted user passwords and other security-related information, restricting access to only privileged users."
Explain the concept of temporary password storage at the application level.,"At the application level, passwords can be held temporarily in various intermediate storage locations. These include `buffers`, which are temporary memory areas for data transfer; `caches`, which are components that store data for faster retrieval; and even within a `web page` itself, such as in browser cache or form data. It is strongly advised not to save passwords in web page caches. A significant concern is that the user typically has no control over the management of these storage locations, meaning passwords could persist longer than anticipated, increasing potential security risks."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a claimant providing a password, which is then hashed by the verifier system using a `hash function`. The verifier system, which does not store the actual passwords but only their hashes, compares the newly computed hash (`h(password)`) with the stored hash (`h(password_A)`) associated with the claimant's account in its `password table`. If the two hashes match, the system accepts the password; otherwise, it rejects it. A `hash function` is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a hash value or digest, in a way that is computationally difficult to reverse. A `password table` is a database or file within a system that stores user account identifiers alongside their corresponding hashed passwords."
What is the role of the verifier in hashed password verification?,"The verifier's role in hashed password verification is to authenticate a claimant without storing their actual password. The verifier (system B) maintains a `password table` that contains only the hashes of users' passwords, not the plaintext passwords themselves. When a claimant (A) provides a password, the verifier applies a `hash function` to this input password. It then compares the resulting hash with the stored hash (`h(password_A)`) associated with claimant A in its password table. Based on this comparison, the verifier either accepts or rejects the authentication attempt. A `hash function` is a one-way cryptographic function that transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, making it suitable for secure password storage. A `password table` is a data structure used by the system to store user credentials, specifically the hashed versions of passwords, for verification purposes."
Why does a verifier store password hashes instead of actual passwords?,"A verifier stores password hashes instead of actual passwords primarily for security reasons. By storing only the `hashes` of passwords, even if the password table is compromised, the attacker does not gain access to the plaintext passwords. Instead, they only have the hashes, which are difficult to reverse engineer back into the original passwords due to the one-way nature of `hash functions`. This significantly reduces the risk of password exposure. A `hash` is a fixed-size string of characters generated by a hash function, representing the original data. A `hash function` is a cryptographic algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size value, designed to be irreversible."
Summarise the main categories of attacks on passwords.,"Attacks on passwords can be broadly categorized into `Offline Guessing Attacks` and `Phishing and Spoofing`. Offline Guessing Attacks involve an attacker obtaining hashed passwords and attempting to guess the original passwords without direct interaction with the live system. These attacks can be further classified into `Exhaustive attacks` (also known as brute force attacks) and `Intelligent attacks`, such as `Dictionary attacks`. `Phishing` is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. `Spoofing` involves an attacker disguising themselves as a legitimate user, device, or client on a network to gain unauthorized access to systems or data."
Explain the difference between exhaustive attacks and dictionary attacks in the context of password guessing.,"In the context of password guessing, `exhaustive attacks` and `dictionary attacks` are both types of intelligent attacks. An `exhaustive attack`, also known as a brute force attack, involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method is comprehensive but can be very time-consuming. A `dictionary attack`, on the other hand, attempts to guess passwords by trying a predefined list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords (a 'dictionary'). This approach is generally faster than an exhaustive attack if the password is a common word or phrase, but it is less comprehensive as it only tests known patterns."
What are 'Phishing' and 'Spoofing' in the context of password attacks?,"`Phishing` and `Spoofing` are two common methods of attacking passwords. `Phishing` is a deceptive technique where attackers attempt to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by impersonating a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. This often involves tricking users into clicking malicious links or entering credentials on fake websites. `Spoofing` refers to the act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. This can involve email spoofing, IP spoofing, or website spoofing, all aimed at deceiving recipients or systems into believing the communication is legitimate, often to facilitate the theft of credentials."
Provide a detailed explanation of an offline guessing attack on passwords.,"An `offline guessing attack` is a type of password attack where an attacker first obtains the hashed passwords from a system and then attempts to guess the original plaintext passwords without needing to interact with the live system. The process typically involves the attacker taking a `plain text` password, applying a `hash function` to it, and then comparing the resulting `hashed text` with the stolen hashed passwords. If a match is found, the attacker has successfully guessed the password. This is considered a plausible threat due to several factors: numerous incidents of `stolen (hashed) passwords` resulting from server hacks or traffic sniffing, and the common practice of users reusing the `same passwords across different accounts`. The compromise of a password for one account can therefore affect other accounts, making this attack highly effective. A `hash function` is a one-way mathematical algorithm that transforms an input into a fixed-size string of characters, making it difficult to reverse. `Plain text` refers to data in its original, unencrypted form. `Hashed text` is the output of a hash function, representing the original data in a fixed-size, usually alphanumeric, string."
Summarise why offline guessing attacks are considered a plausible threat.,"Offline guessing attacks are considered a plausible threat due to several critical factors. Firstly, there are many incidents where `stolen (hashed) passwords` are obtained by attackers, often as a consequence of `hacks on servers` or `sniffing traffic`. `Traffic sniffing` is the act of monitoring and intercepting data packets traveling over a computer network. Secondly, users frequently employ the `same passwords across different accounts`. This means that if an attacker successfully compromises a password for one account through an offline guessing attack, it can lead to the compromise of other accounts belonging to the same user, amplifying the impact of the attack. `Hashed passwords` are the output of a hash function applied to a plaintext password, stored instead of the original password for security."
Describe the steps an attacker takes in an offline guessing attack.,"In an `offline guessing attack`, an attacker first obtains a list of `hashed passwords` from a compromised system. Then, for each potential password guess (a `plain text` password), the attacker performs the following steps: they apply a `hash function` to the guessed plain text password to generate a corresponding `hashed text`. This newly generated hashed text is then compared against the stolen hashed passwords. If a match is found, the attacker has successfully identified the original password. This process is repeated for many guesses until a significant number of passwords are cracked. A `hash function` is a cryptographic algorithm that converts an input into a fixed-size string of characters, designed to be one-way. `Plain text` is unencrypted, readable data. `Hashed passwords` are the result of applying a hash function to a password."
What are the consequences of users reusing the same passwords across different accounts in the context of offline guessing attacks?,"The consequence of users reusing the `same passwords across different accounts` is a significant amplification of risk in the context of `offline guessing attacks`. If an attacker successfully obtains `hashed passwords` from one system and cracks a password through an offline guessing attack, that same password can then be used to gain unauthorized access to other accounts belonging to the user on different services or platforms. This means that the compromise of a single password effectively compromises multiple accounts, making the user much more vulnerable. An `offline guessing attack` is where an attacker attempts to guess plaintext passwords from stolen hashed passwords without interacting with the live system. `Hashed passwords` are the output of a hash function, stored instead of the original password."
Recap the storage location of password hashes in Unix/Linux systems as mentioned in the document.,"In Unix systems, password hashes were traditionally stored in the ""/etc/passwd"" file. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, for enhanced security, password hashes are now stored in the `shadow file`, which is located at ""/etc/shadow"". The `shadow file` is a critical system file that stores encrypted user passwords and other security-related information, with restricted access to only privileged users to prevent unauthorized viewing of password hashes."
Summarise the key findings regarding the causes of the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The SingHealth cyber attack was attributed to a combination of `human lapses` by employees and `vulnerabilities with the IT system`. The report concluded that the breach into the public healthcare group's database was preventable, despite the attacker's skill. Key weaknesses included the SCM database operating on an open network linked to Citrix servers, a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access to the SCM database and Citrix servers, inadequately secured Citrix servers where `2-factor authentication (2FA)` was not exclusively enforced for administrator access, and the presence of `weak administrator account passwords`. `Human lapses` refer to errors or negligence by individuals. `Vulnerabilities` are weaknesses in a system that can be exploited by attackers. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity."
Explain the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the SingHealth network and SCM system that contributed to the cyber attack.,"Several vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the SingHealth network and SCM system contributed significantly to the attacker's success. Firstly, the `SCM database` (owned by SingHealth) was configured to function on an `open network` that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), creating a critical vulnerability. Secondly, there was a `lack of monitoring` of the SCM database for unusual queries and access, with no controls to detect or block bulk queries, and the Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis of vulnerabilities. Thirdly, the `Citrix servers were not adequately secured` against unauthorized access, specifically, `2-factor authentication (2FA)` was not enforced as the exclusive means for administrator login, allowing access through other routes. Lastly, `weak administrator account passwords` were identified as another exploitable weakness, which, despite being discovered during testing, remained unaddressed due to `mismanaged and inadequate remediation` by IHiS. An `open network` is a network segment that is easily accessible and lacks sufficient security controls. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security measure requiring two distinct forms of identification before access is granted."
What role did the SCM database and Citrix servers play in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The `SCM database` and `Citrix servers` played crucial roles in the SingHealth cyber attack. The SCM database, which contained sensitive data, was configured to operate on an `open network` directly linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH). This created a critical vulnerability that the attacker exploited. Furthermore, there was a `lack of monitoring` for unusual queries and access to the SCM database, meaning bulk data queries went undetected. The `Citrix servers` themselves were inadequately secured; `2-factor authentication (2FA)` was not exclusively enforced for administrator access, allowing the attacker to bypass this security measure and access the server through alternative routes. This combination of an exposed database and poorly secured access points on the Citrix servers allowed the attacker to obtain the data. An `open network` refers to a network segment with insufficient security, making it easily accessible. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security method that requires two types of credentials for verification."
Discuss the impact of weak administrator account passwords and inadequate remediation in the SingHealth incident.,"In the SingHealth incident, `weak administrator account passwords` were identified as a significant vulnerability that likely contributed to the attacker's success. This weakness was discovered during a test, but the subsequent `remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate`. As a result, a number of vulnerabilities, including the issue of weak passwords, remained unaddressed at the time of the cyber attack. This failure to properly remediate known weaknesses meant that a critical entry point for attackers was left open, allowing them to exploit these easily guessable credentials to gain unauthorized access. `Remediation` refers to the process of correcting or fixing a vulnerability or security flaw."
How did the lack of monitoring contribute to the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The `lack of monitoring` played a significant role in the SingHealth cyber attack by failing to detect and prevent malicious activity. Specifically, there was no existing control to detect or block `bulk queries` being made to the `SCM database`. This allowed the attacker to extract large amounts of data without triggering any alerts. Additionally, the `Citrix servers` of SGH were not monitored for `real-time analysis` and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. This absence of proactive monitoring meant that suspicious activities, potential exploits, and system weaknesses went unnoticed, providing the attacker with ample time and opportunity to carry out the breach undetected. `Bulk queries` are database requests designed to retrieve a large volume of data. `Real-time analysis` involves processing and analyzing data as it is generated or received, providing immediate insights."
Summarise the details of the Adobe data breach mentioned in the document.,"The Adobe data breach, which occurred in October 2013, impacted at least `38 million users`. This incident exposed user account information and led to a flurry of password reset emails. Additionally, a massive `source code leak` at Adobe broadened to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products. The breach highlighted the risks associated with storing user data and proprietary software code. `Source code` refers to the human-readable instructions written by programmers that define how a software program works."
What information was leaked in the LinkedIn password incident?,"In the LinkedIn password incident, more than `6.4 million LinkedIn passwords` were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. While some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords as a precautionary measure. This incident underscored the importance of strong password practices and the risks associated with large-scale data breaches. `Encrypted` means that data has been converted into a code to prevent unauthorized access, though even encrypted data can be vulnerable if the encryption method is weak or keys are compromised."
Describe the scale of the Russia gang hack mentioned in the document.,"The Russia gang hack was a massive cyberattack that compromised `1.2 billion usernames and passwords`. This incident highlights the immense scale and potential impact of organized cybercrime, where a single group can amass an enormous volume of credentials. Such large-scale breaches pose a significant threat to global online security, as compromised credentials can be used for various malicious activities across numerous platforms."
What was the Pastebin incident about regarding credentials?,"The Pastebin incident involved more than `300,000 credentials`, including usernames and passwords, being posted on the clipboard website Pastebin.com in the year 2013. This information was revealed through an analysis by a Swiss security firm. `Pastebin.com` is a website where users can store plain text, often used by developers for sharing code snippets, but also unfortunately by attackers to dump stolen data. The incident demonstrates how compromised credentials can be publicly exposed and distributed."
Summarise the vulnerability found in the Starbucks mobile app.,"A vulnerability was discovered in the Starbucks mobile app that could put coffee drinkers' information at risk. Specifically, the app was found to store `user information and passwords in clear text`. This means that sensitive data, including usernames, email addresses, and passwords, was not encrypted and was directly readable, making it highly susceptible to unauthorized access if the device or app's data storage was compromised. `Clear text` refers to data that is not encrypted and is therefore readable by anyone who can access it."
Provide a summary of the various password-related incidents discussed in the document.,"The document highlights several significant password-related incidents. The `Adobe breach` impacted at least 38 million users, exposing account information and leading to a source code leak. The `LinkedIn leak` saw over 6.4 million passwords exposed, prompting users to change their credentials. A `Russia gang hack` was responsible for compromising an astounding 1.2 billion usernames and passwords. Separately, more than `300,000 credentials` were publicly posted on `Pastebin.com`. Finally, the `Starbucks mobile app` was found to store user information and passwords in `clear text`, leaving sensitive data unencrypted and vulnerable. These incidents collectively underscore the pervasive threat of password compromise and the critical need for robust security measures. `Clear text` refers to data that is unencrypted and easily readable."
Provide a comprehensive summary of a brute force attack on passwords.,"A `brute force guessing attack` against passwords is a method where an attacker attempts to `guess a password` by systematically `enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes` in sequence. For each generated password candidate, the attacker computes its hash and then checks if it matches the target hash (the stolen hash of the actual password). If a match is found, the password is cracked. A key measure against brute force attacks is to `increase the space of possible passwords`. This can be achieved by using `longer passwords` and allowing for a `greater variety of symbols`, including alphabets, numerals, and signs. Implementing a strong `password policy` is an important means to increase the difficulties of such attacks. A `hash` is a fixed-size string of characters generated by a hash function. A `password policy` is a set of rules designed to enhance password security by enforcing complexity, length, and expiration requirements."
Explain how to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack.,"To increase the difficulty of a `brute force attack`, the primary strategy is to `increase the space of possible passwords`. This means making the set of all potential passwords much larger, thereby requiring more time and computational resources for an attacker to enumerate every combination. Practical ways to achieve this include using `longer passwords` and incorporating a `greater variety of symbols` in passwords, such as alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs. The implementation of a robust `password policy` is an important means to enforce these practices, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess passwords through exhaustive enumeration. A `brute force attack` is a trial-and-error method used to guess information, such as a password, by trying many combinations."
What is the role of a password policy in mitigating brute force attacks?,"A `password policy` plays a crucial role in mitigating `brute force attacks` by increasing the inherent difficulty of guessing passwords. It achieves this by enforcing rules that expand the `space of possible passwords`. Such policies typically mandate requirements like minimum password length, the inclusion of a mix of character types (e.g., uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols), and sometimes periodic password changes. By making passwords longer and more complex, a password policy significantly increases the number of combinations an attacker must try in a brute force attack, thereby making the attack computationally infeasible or prohibitively time-consuming. A `password policy` is a set of rules designed to improve computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly."
Describe the mechanism by which a brute force attack attempts to guess a password.,"A `brute force attack` attempts to guess a password by systematically `enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes` in a sequential manner. The attacker generates a candidate password, then applies a `hash function` to it to produce a corresponding hash. This newly generated hash is then compared against the target hash, which was typically stolen from a compromised system. If the generated hash matches the target hash, the attacker has successfully identified the original password. This process is repeated exhaustively until a match is found or all possibilities are exhausted. A `hash function` is a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, making it difficult to reverse."
Explain what password entropy measures and how it is represented.,"Password entropy, as measured by `2^k`, quantifies the `bitsize of the password space` for various character combinations. It represents the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords (`c^n`), where `n` is the number of characters in the password and `c` is the number of choices per character (i.e., the size of the character set). A higher entropy value (larger `k`) indicates a larger password space, making the password more resistant to guessing attacks. The table provided illustrates this by showing how the bitsize of the password space increases with password length (`n`) and the variety of characters (`c`) used. `Bitsize` refers to the number of bits required to represent a certain amount of information or a range of values. `Password space` is the total number of unique passwords that could possibly be created given a certain length and character set."
How does password length and character variety affect password entropy?,"Password length (`n`) and character variety (`c`, or choices per character) significantly affect `password entropy`, which is measured by `2^k`. As the password length (`n`) increases, the `bitsize of the password space` grows, making the password exponentially more complex. Similarly, increasing the `character variety` (`c`), by including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols, also expands the password space. For example, a 5-character password using only lowercase letters has a bitsize of 23.5, while a 10-character password using keyboard characters has a bitsize of 65.7. Both factors contribute to a larger `k` value, indicating higher entropy and greater resistance to brute force attacks. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password, indicating how difficult it is to guess."
What is the current cracking speed of software password crackers according to the document?,"At present, software password crackers are capable of cracking passwords at a rate of up to `16 million passwords per second per PC`. This high cracking speed underscores the critical importance of using strong, high-entropy passwords to resist brute force attacks. Even with modern computing power, a sufficiently complex password can still take an impractically long time to crack. `Password crackers` are software tools designed to recover passwords from data that has been stored or transmitted by a computer system, often by guessing or using cryptographic techniques."
Explain the meaning of 'c' and 'n' in the context of password entropy calculation (c^n).,"In the context of password entropy calculation, where the number of possible passwords is `c^n`, `c` represents the `number of choices per character`, which is essentially the size of the character set available for creating the password. For example, if only lowercase letters are used, `c` would be 26. If lowercase alphanumeric characters are used, `c` would be 36 (26 letters + 10 digits). `n` represents the `number of characters` in the password, or the password's length. Together, `c^n` calculates the total number of unique passwords possible given a specific character set and length. `Password entropy` is a measure of the randomness or unpredictability of a password."
How can one calculate the time it would take to brute-force a password given its entropy and cracking speed?,"To calculate the time it would take to brute-force a password, one would need to know the `total number of possible passwords` (derived from its entropy, `2^k`) and the `cracking speed` of the software password cracker. The total number of possible passwords is `c^n`, where `c` is the number of choices per character and `n` is the password length. The document states that software password crackers can crack up to `16 million passwords per second per PC`. Therefore, the calculation would involve dividing the total number of possible passwords by the cracking speed to estimate the time required. For example, if there are `2^k` possible passwords, and the cracking speed is `S` passwords/second, the time would be `(2^k) / S` seconds. `Brute-force` refers to a trial-and-error method used to guess information by trying many combinations. `Entropy` in this context quantifies the randomness of a password."
Summarise the overall security implications of storing passwords in temporary locations like buffers or caches.,"Storing passwords temporarily in locations such as `buffers`, `caches`, or even `web pages` at the application level carries significant security implications. The primary concern is that the `management of these storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user`. This lack of user control means that a password may be retained for a longer duration than intended or expected, increasing its exposure window. If an attacker gains access to the system or application memory, these temporarily stored plaintext passwords could be easily compromised, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts. `Buffers` are temporary data storage areas, and `caches` are components that store data for faster retrieval."
"What are the primary methods attackers use to compromise passwords, as outlined in the document?","The document outlines several primary methods attackers use to compromise passwords. These include `Offline Guessing Attacks`, which involve obtaining hashed passwords and then attempting to guess the original passwords through `exhaustive attacks` (brute force) or `intelligent attacks` (like dictionary attacks). Another significant category is `Phishing and Spoofing`, where attackers deceive users into revealing their credentials. Additionally, vulnerabilities such as `weak administrator account passwords` and storing passwords in `clear text` (as seen in the Starbucks app incident) are exploited. Finally, large-scale `data breaches` resulting from server hacks or traffic sniffing lead to the theft of hashed passwords, enabling offline attacks. `Hashed passwords` are the result of a one-way cryptographic function applied to a password. `Clear text` refers to unencrypted, readable data."
Discuss the importance of strong password policies in preventing various types of password attacks.,"Strong `password policies` are crucial in preventing various types of password attacks, particularly `brute force attacks` and `offline guessing attacks`. By enforcing requirements such as minimum length, complexity (e.g., requiring a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and discouraging reuse, password policies significantly increase the `password entropy`. This makes it computationally much harder and time-consuming for attackers to guess passwords, even with high-speed cracking software. While policies don't directly prevent `phishing` or `spoofing`, they ensure that if credentials are stolen, they are harder to exploit if the policy encourages unique and complex passwords for each service. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
How do server hacks and traffic sniffing contribute to password-related incidents?,"Server hacks and `traffic sniffing` are significant contributors to password-related incidents, primarily by enabling `offline guessing attacks`. When servers are hacked, attackers can often obtain `stolen (hashed) passwords` directly from the system's password files, such as the `SAM file` in Windows or the `shadow file` in Unix/Linux. `Traffic sniffing` involves intercepting data packets as they travel across a network, which can sometimes expose password hashes or even plaintext passwords if they are transmitted insecurely. Once these hashed passwords are acquired, attackers can then attempt to crack them offline without further interaction with the target system, leading to widespread account compromises, especially if users reuse passwords. `Traffic sniffing` is the act of monitoring network traffic to capture data. `Hashed passwords` are the output of a hash function, stored instead of the original password."
"What are the risks associated with storing passwords in clear text, as exemplified by the Starbucks app incident?","Storing passwords in `clear text` poses an extremely high security risk, as exemplified by the Starbucks app incident. `Clear text` refers to data that is unencrypted and therefore directly readable by anyone who gains access to it. If an application or system stores passwords in clear text, any compromise of that application's data storage, whether through a hack, malware, or even physical access to a device, immediately exposes the user's plaintext passwords. This makes it trivial for attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, as no cracking or decryption is required. It bypasses all security benefits of hashing and encryption, leaving user credentials completely vulnerable. `Clear text` is data that is not encrypted and is easily readable."
Summarise the general advice given to users following large-scale password leaks like the LinkedIn incident.,"Following large-scale password leaks, such as the LinkedIn incident where millions of passwords were exposed, the general advice given to users is to `change their passwords`. This recommendation is crucial because even if some login details were encrypted, the risk of compromise remains high, especially if the encryption is weak or if users have reused those passwords on other services. Changing passwords immediately helps to mitigate the risk of attackers using the leaked credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts. It also implicitly encourages the use of unique and strong passwords for different services. `Encrypted` means data has been converted into a code to prevent unauthorized access."
How does the concept of 'bitsize of password space' relate to password security?,"The `bitsize of password space`, measured by `2^k`, directly relates to password security by quantifying the total number of unique passwords that can be generated given a specific length and character set. A larger bitsize (higher `k` value) indicates a greater number of possible password combinations, which in turn means higher `password entropy`. This makes the password more resistant to `brute force attacks`, as an attacker would need to try an exponentially larger number of combinations to guess the correct password. Therefore, increasing the bitsize of the password space, through longer and more varied passwords, is a fundamental strategy for enhancing password security. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
What are the two main types of offline guessing attacks?,"The two main types of `offline guessing attacks` are `Exhaustive attacks` and `Intelligent attacks`. `Exhaustive attacks`, also known as brute force attacks, involve systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. `Intelligent attacks` are more refined and include methods like `Dictionary attacks`, where attackers use pre-compiled lists of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords to try and guess the target password. Both types require the attacker to first obtain hashed passwords from a compromised system. An `offline guessing attack` is an attempt to crack passwords from stolen hashes without interacting with the live system."
"Describe the security implications of an SCM database operating on an open network, as seen in the SingHealth attack.","The security implication of an `SCM database` operating on an `open network`, as seen in the SingHealth attack, is the creation of a `critical vulnerability` that attackers can readily exploit. An `open network` implies a lack of sufficient security controls, making the database easily accessible to unauthorized entities. In the SingHealth case, this database was linked to Citrix servers, providing a direct pathway for attackers. This configuration significantly lowers the barrier to entry for attackers, allowing them to potentially access, query, and exfiltrate sensitive data without facing robust network segmentation or access controls. `SCM database` refers to a database used for supply chain management or similar critical system data. A `critical vulnerability` is a severe weakness that can be easily exploited to cause significant harm."
"How does the enforcement of 2-factor authentication (2FA) impact system security, referencing the SingHealth incident?","The enforcement of `2-factor authentication (2FA)` significantly enhances system security by requiring two distinct forms of verification before granting access. In the SingHealth incident, the `Citrix servers were not adequately secured` because `2FA was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in as an administrator`. This allowed the attacker to bypass 2FA and access the server through other routes that did not require this additional layer of security. If 2FA had been strictly enforced, even if an attacker obtained administrator credentials, they would still need a second factor (e.g., a token, biometric, or code from a mobile device) to gain access, thereby preventing unauthorized entry. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity."
What is the primary goal of hashed password verification?,"The primary goal of `hashed password verification` is to securely authenticate a user without ever storing or handling their actual plaintext password. Instead, the system stores only the `hash` of the password. When a user attempts to log in, their provided password is hashed, and this newly computed hash is compared against the stored hash. This process ensures that even if the password database is compromised, the actual passwords remain unknown to attackers, significantly enhancing security. A `hash` is a fixed-size string of characters generated by a hash function, designed to be one-way and irreversible."
Summarise the concept of 'shadow file' in modern Unix/Linux systems for password storage.,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, the `shadow file`, located at ""/etc/shadow"", is used for secure password storage. This file stores `password hashes` and other security-related user account information. Its purpose is to enhance security by separating the password hashes from the ""/etc/passwd"" file, which traditionally contained both user account information and password hashes. By restricting access to the `shadow file` to only privileged users, it prevents non-privileged users or attackers from easily accessing and attempting to crack password hashes, thereby protecting user credentials. `Password hashes` are the result of applying a hash function to a password."
Why is it important not to save passwords in a web page cache?,"It is critically important not to save passwords in a `web page cache` because doing so exposes them to potential compromise. A `web page cache` is a temporary storage area used by web browsers to store elements of visited web pages for faster loading on subsequent visits. If passwords are saved in this cache, they can be accessed by anyone who gains unauthorized access to the computer or browser, or by malicious software. Since the management of these temporary storage locations is often beyond the user's direct control, passwords could persist longer than intended, increasing the risk of exposure and unauthorized access to accounts. `Cache` refers to a temporary storage area that stores frequently accessed data for quicker retrieval."
How does the reuse of passwords across different accounts exacerbate the impact of data breaches?,"The reuse of passwords across different accounts significantly exacerbates the impact of `data breaches` because it creates a cascading vulnerability. If an attacker obtains a user's password from one compromised service (e.g., through a `server hack` or `traffic sniffing`), they can then use that same password to gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts on other, unrelated services. This phenomenon is often exploited in `offline guessing attacks`. A single successful breach can thus lead to multiple account compromises, multiplying the damage and making the user's overall online presence much less secure. `Data breaches` are security incidents where sensitive, protected, or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an individual unauthorized to do so."
What is the primary difference between storing passwords in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow in Unix/Linux systems?,"The primary difference between storing passwords in ""/etc/passwd"" and ""/etc/shadow"" in Unix/Linux systems lies in their security implications and access controls. Historically, ""/etc/passwd"" stored both user account information and `password hashes`. However, this made password hashes accessible to any user who could read the ""/etc/passwd"" file, making them vulnerable to `offline guessing attacks`. In modern Unix/Linux systems, `password hashes` are moved to the `/etc/shadow` file. The `shadow file` has much stricter permissions, typically readable only by the root user, thereby preventing non-privileged users or attackers from easily accessing the hashed passwords. This separation significantly enhances security by making it harder for attackers to obtain the hashes needed for offline cracking. `Password hashes` are the result of a one-way cryptographic function applied to a password."
Can you summarise the key considerations behind password storage in operating systems?,"Key considerations behind password storage in operating systems revolve around security and access control. Password hashes, not plaintext passwords, are stored in dedicated password files. In Windows, this is the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file (%windir%\system32\config\SAM). In modern Unix/Linux, it's the `shadow file` (/etc/shadow), which replaced the less secure /etc/passwd for hash storage. Additionally, passwords may be temporarily held in application-level storage like buffers, caches, or web pages, which poses a risk as user control over these locations is limited, potentially keeping passwords exposed longer than intended. The use of `password hashes` is a fundamental security practice to prevent direct exposure of passwords even if storage files are compromised. The `shadow file` provides enhanced security by restricting access to password hashes to privileged users only."
Summarise the concept of a 'password file' in operating systems.,"In operating systems, a `password file` is a designated location where password hashes are stored. This file serves as a critical component for user authentication. For instance, in Windows systems, this is the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file (%windir%\system32\config\SAM). In modern Unix/Linux systems, it is the `shadow file` (/etc/shadow). The purpose of storing `password hashes` in these files, rather than plaintext passwords, is to enhance security. Even if an attacker gains access to the password file, they only obtain hashes, which are computationally difficult to reverse into original passwords. A `password hash` is the output of a one-way cryptographic function applied to a password."
What is the significance of the SAM file in Windows systems for password storage?,"The `SAM file` (Security Accounts Manager file), located at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"", is highly significant in Windows systems for password storage. It is a database file that stores local user account information, including the `hashed passwords` of users. This file is crucial for the operating system's authentication process. By storing hashes instead of plaintext passwords, Windows aims to protect user credentials even if the SAM file itself is compromised. Access to this file is typically restricted to prevent unauthorized reading of password hashes. A `hashed password` is the result of applying a one-way cryptographic function to a user's password."
Explain the concept of 'Claimant A' and 'Verifier (system) B' in hashed password verification.,"In hashed password verification, `Claimant A` refers to the user attempting to authenticate, who provides a password. `Verifier (system) B` refers to the system responsible for authenticating Claimant A. The verifier system does not store Claimant A's actual password but rather its hash in a `password table`. When Claimant A submits a password, Verifier B hashes it and compares the result to the stored hash. This separation of roles ensures that the plaintext password is never stored or directly handled by the system, enhancing security. A `password table` is a database or file within a system that stores user account identifiers alongside their corresponding hashed passwords."
What is the primary security notice regarding verifiers in hashed password verification?,"The primary security notice regarding verifiers in hashed password verification is that the verifier `does (should) not store the passwords, only their hashes`. This is a fundamental principle of secure password management. By storing only the `hashes` of passwords, even if the verifier's `password table` is compromised, the actual plaintext passwords remain protected. This significantly reduces the risk of password exposure and unauthorized access, as attackers would only obtain irreversible hash values. A `hash` is a fixed-size string of characters generated by a hash function, designed to be one-way and irreversible."
How do 'Exhaustive attacks' work in the context of password attacks?,"`Exhaustive attacks`, also known as brute force attacks, work by systematically trying every single possible combination of characters to guess a password. In the context of password attacks, particularly `offline guessing attacks`, an attacker first obtains `hashed passwords`. Then, for each possible password combination, they compute its hash using the same `hash function` as the target system. This generated hash is then compared against the stolen hashed passwords. The process continues until a match is found, thereby revealing the original password. This method is comprehensive but can be extremely time-consuming for complex passwords. A `hash function` is a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms an input into a fixed-size string of characters."
What makes 'Intelligent attacks' different from exhaustive attacks?,"`Intelligent attacks`, such as `Dictionary attacks`, differ from `exhaustive attacks` in their approach to guessing passwords. While exhaustive attacks try every possible combination, intelligent attacks use more refined methods based on common patterns and known vulnerabilities. For example, a `dictionary attack` uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords. This makes intelligent attacks generally faster if the password is not truly random, as they don't waste time on unlikely combinations. However, they are less comprehensive than exhaustive attacks, as they will fail if the password is not in their dictionary or pattern set. Both are types of `offline guessing attacks`."
Explain the concept of 'sniffing traffic' as a source of stolen passwords.,"`Sniffing traffic` refers to the act of monitoring and intercepting data packets as they travel over a computer network. In the context of password attacks, it can be a source of `stolen (hashed) passwords` if passwords or their hashes are transmitted insecurely (e.g., unencrypted) across the network. An attacker using a `traffic sniffer` can capture these packets and extract the password information. This method contributes to the plausibility of `offline guessing attacks`, as the captured hashes can then be subjected to cracking attempts without direct interaction with the target system. `Traffic sniffing` is a form of network eavesdropping."
What is the significance of the statement 'compromise of a password for one account affects other accounts'?,"The statement 'compromise of a password for one account affects other accounts' highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from `password reuse`. If a user employs the `same password across different accounts`, and that password is compromised in one instance (e.g., through a `server hack` or `offline guessing attack`), an attacker can then use the identical credentials to gain unauthorized access to the user's other accounts on different services. This significantly amplifies the impact of a single breach, making password reuse a major security risk. `Offline guessing attack` is an attempt to crack passwords from stolen hashes without interacting with the live system."
How did the SCM database's link to Citrix servers create a vulnerability in the SingHealth attack?,"The `SCM database's` link to `Citrix servers` created a critical vulnerability in the SingHealth attack because the database was functioning on an `open network`. This direct connection meant that the Citrix servers, which were inadequately secured and lacked proper `2-factor authentication (2FA)` enforcement for administrator access, became a gateway to the sensitive SCM database. An attacker exploiting weaknesses in the Citrix server security could then pivot to access the SCM database, which was exposed on the open network, to obtain data. An `open network` is a network segment that lacks sufficient security controls, making it easily accessible. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security process requiring two distinct forms of identification."
What was the consequence of IHiS's mismanagement of the remediation process in the SingHealth incident?,"The consequence of IHiS's `mismanagement and inadequate remediation process` in the SingHealth incident was that a number of `vulnerabilities remained` unaddressed at the time of the cyber attack. Specifically, `weak administrator account passwords`, which had been discovered during a test, were not properly fixed. This failure to remediate known weaknesses meant that critical security flaws persisted, allowing the attacker to exploit them successfully. The mismanagement effectively left the system exposed to previously identified threats, directly contributing to the attacker's success in obtaining data. `Remediation` refers to the process of correcting or fixing a vulnerability or security flaw."
What is the implication of 'real-time analysis' not being performed on Citrix servers in the SingHealth attack?,"The implication of `real-time analysis` not being performed on `Citrix servers` in the SingHealth attack was a critical lack of immediate detection for vulnerabilities and issues. `Real-time analysis` involves continuously monitoring and processing data as it is generated, providing instant alerts for suspicious activities or security flaws. Without this, the Citrix servers, which were inadequately secured and lacked exclusive `2-factor authentication (2FA)` enforcement, could be exploited by attackers without triggering any immediate alarms. This allowed the attacker to operate undetected for longer periods, facilitating their access and data exfiltration. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security process requiring two distinct forms of identification."
How did the Adobe breach impact users beyond just password resets?,"The Adobe breach impacted users beyond just password resets by exposing `user account information` for at least 38 million users. Furthermore, the incident involved a massive `source code leak` that broadened to include Adobe's Photoshop family of graphical design products. This meant that proprietary software code became exposed, potentially revealing further vulnerabilities or intellectual property. The breach thus had implications for both user data privacy and the security of Adobe's software products. `Source code` refers to the human-readable instructions written by programmers that define how a software program works."
"What advice was given to LinkedIn users after their password leak, and why?","After the LinkedIn password leak, where over 6.4 million passwords were exposed, all users were advised to `change their passwords`. This advice was given as a precautionary measure because, despite some login details being encrypted, the risk of compromise remained. Changing passwords helps to mitigate the threat that attackers might use the leaked credentials to gain unauthorized access, especially if the encryption was weak or if users had reused those passwords on other services. `Encrypted` means that data has been converted into a code to prevent unauthorized access."
What is the significance of the '1.2 billion usernames and passwords' compromised by the Russia gang?,"The compromise of `1.2 billion usernames and passwords` by the Russia gang is highly significant due to the sheer scale of the breach. This massive volume of stolen credentials represents an enormous threat to global online security. Such a large dataset of compromised login details can be used for widespread `credential stuffing attacks`, where attackers try leaked username/password combinations on other websites, or for various other malicious activities, impacting a vast number of users and services. This incident underscores the severe consequences of large-scale cybercrime. `Credential stuffing` is a cyberattack in which stolen credential pairs (typically username and password) are used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts."
How does the 'bitsize of password space' relate to the number of possible passwords (c^n)?,"The `bitsize of password space` is directly related to the number of possible passwords (`c^n`) by being its base-2 logarithm. Specifically, the bitsize (`k`) is such that the total number of possible passwords is `2^k`. Here, `c` represents the number of choices per character (the size of the character set), and `n` represents the number of characters in the password (its length). A larger `c^n` value means a larger `k` value, indicating a greater number of unique password combinations and thus higher `password entropy`. This mathematical relationship quantifies how much more difficult a password is to guess as its length and character variety increase. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
What is the practical implication of software password crackers being able to crack 16 million passwords per second?,"The practical implication of software password crackers being able to crack `16 million passwords per second per PC` is that `weak or short passwords are extremely vulnerable` to `brute force attacks`. Even seemingly complex passwords can be cracked quickly if they don't have sufficient `password entropy` (i.e., enough length and character variety). This high cracking speed necessitates the implementation of strong `password policies` that enforce longer and more complex passwords to ensure that the time required to brute-force a password becomes impractically long, even with modern computing power. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
How does increasing the variety of symbols in a password help against brute force attacks?,"Increasing the `variety of symbols` in a password helps against `brute force attacks` by significantly expanding the `space of possible passwords`. When a password includes a mix of alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs, the number of choices per character (`c`) increases. This exponential increase in `c^n` (where `n` is password length) leads to a much higher `password entropy` (larger `k` value). Consequently, an attacker attempting a brute force attack must try a vastly greater number of combinations, making the attack computationally much more intensive and time-consuming, thereby increasing the password's resistance. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
What is the primary function of a hash function in password storage and verification?,"The primary function of a `hash function` in password storage and verification is to transform a plaintext password into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a `hash` or digest, in a one-way, irreversible manner. This hash is then stored instead of the actual password. During verification, the user's input password is again passed through the same hash function, and the resulting hash is compared to the stored hash. This ensures that the actual password is never stored or transmitted in plaintext, significantly enhancing security by protecting credentials even if the password database is compromised. A `hash function` is a cryptographic algorithm designed to be computationally difficult to reverse."
Why is it important for a system to monitor its SCM database for unusual queries and access?,"It is important for a system to monitor its `SCM database` for `unusual queries and access` to detect and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration or manipulation, as highlighted by the SingHealth incident. A `lack of monitoring` means that activities like `bulk queries` (requests for large volumes of data) can go unnoticed, allowing attackers to extract sensitive information without triggering alerts. Proactive monitoring enables `real-time analysis` of database activity, helping to identify suspicious patterns that could indicate a breach in progress, thereby allowing for timely intervention and mitigation. `SCM database` refers to a database used for supply chain management or similar critical system data. `Bulk queries` are database requests designed to retrieve a large volume of data."
"How does the concept of 'human lapses' contribute to cyber attacks, as seen in SingHealth?","The concept of `human lapses` contributes significantly to cyber attacks, as seen in the SingHealth incident, by introducing vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. `Human lapses` refer to errors, negligence, or poor security practices by individuals. In the SingHealth case, these lapses, combined with IT system weaknesses, were identified as causes of the breach. Examples could include not enforcing `2-factor authentication (2FA)` exclusively for administrator access, or the presence of `weak administrator account passwords` that were not remediated due to mismanagement. Such human-related failures create exploitable entry points for attackers, even if the attacker is skilled. `2-factor authentication (2FA)` is a security process requiring two distinct forms of identification."
What is the general advice for users regarding password security based on the document's incidents?,"Based on the document's incidents, the general advice for users regarding password security is to use `strong, high-entropy passwords` and to `avoid reusing the same passwords across different accounts`. Incidents like the LinkedIn leak and Russia gang hack underscore the need to change passwords if a service is compromised. The Starbucks app incident highlights the danger of applications storing passwords in `clear text`, emphasizing the need for users to be cautious about app security. Furthermore, the SingHealth attack points to the importance of strong `password policies` and `2-factor authentication (2FA)` on the system side, which users should ideally leverage when available. `High-entropy passwords` are those that are long and use a variety of characters, making them unpredictable. `Clear text` refers to unencrypted, readable data."
Why is it crucial for a verifier to only store password hashes and not the actual passwords?,"It is crucial for a verifier to only store `password hashes` and not the actual passwords because this practice is a fundamental security measure against data breaches. If a verifier's system or `password table` is compromised, an attacker would only gain access to the `hashes`, which are the irreversible output of a `hash function`. Without the original plaintext passwords, the attacker faces a significantly harder challenge in trying to crack them, typically requiring `offline guessing attacks` like brute force. If plaintext passwords were stored, a breach would immediately expose all user credentials, leading to widespread account compromises. A `hash function` is a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters."
How do 'dictionary attacks' specifically work to guess passwords?,"`Dictionary attacks` specifically work to guess passwords by attempting to match `hashed passwords` against a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords, known as a 'dictionary'. In an `offline guessing attack` scenario, an attacker first obtains the hashed passwords. Then, for each entry in their dictionary, they apply the same `hash function` used by the target system to the dictionary word. The resulting hash is then compared to the stolen hashed passwords. If a match is found, the attacker has successfully identified the original password. This method is efficient for common or easily guessable passwords but fails for strong, unique passwords not found in the dictionary. A `hash function` is a one-way cryptographic algorithm that transforms an input into a fixed-size string of characters."
What is the general principle behind increasing the 'space of possible passwords' to enhance security?,"The general principle behind increasing the `space of possible passwords` to enhance security is to make `brute force attacks` computationally infeasible. The `space of possible passwords` refers to the total number of unique combinations of characters that could form a password, calculated as `c^n` (choices per character to the power of length). By increasing this space (e.g., through longer passwords and greater character variety), the number of guesses an attacker must make grows exponentially. This increases the `password entropy` and the time required to crack the password, even with high-speed cracking software, making it a robust defense against exhaustive guessing attempts. `Password entropy` is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
What are the implications of a 'source code leak' as seen in the Adobe breach?,"The implications of a `source code leak`, as seen in the Adobe breach, are significant and far-reaching. `Source code` refers to the human-readable instructions that define how a software program works. When source code is leaked, it can expose proprietary algorithms, intellectual property, and, critically, potential `vulnerabilities` within the software. Attackers can analyze the leaked code to find new exploits or understand how security mechanisms are implemented, making it easier to bypass them. This can lead to future attacks on the software itself or systems that use it, compromising the security of users and the integrity of the product. A `vulnerability` is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by attackers."
How does the concept of 'password table' function in hashed password verification?,"The `password table` functions as a central repository within the `verifier (system) B` for securely storing user credentials in hashed form. It contains entries that link a user's identifier (e.g., username) to their corresponding `hashed password` (`h(password_A)`). When `Claimant A` attempts to log in, the system hashes the provided password and then queries the password table to find the stored hash associated with Claimant A. The comparison between the newly computed hash and the stored hash determines the success or failure of the authentication. This table is crucial because it allows verification without ever storing or exposing plaintext passwords. A `hashed password` is the result of applying a one-way cryptographic function to a password."
