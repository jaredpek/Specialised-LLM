What is the primary method for storing password hashes in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are primarily stored in a dedicated password file. This file contains the hashed versions of user passwords, rather than the plain-text passwords themselves, which is a security measure."
Where are passwords stored in a Windows system?,"In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. The specific path for this file is typically `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`, where `%windir%` refers to the Windows installation directory."
How are passwords stored in Unix and modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In traditional Unix systems, passwords were stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, for enhanced security, password hashes are stored in a separate `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`."
What are intermediate storage locations for passwords at the application level?,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even within a web page. It is crucial not to save passwords in caches due to security risks."
What is the user's control over temporary password storage at the application level?,"The management of temporary password storage locations at the application level, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, is normally beyond the direct control of the user. This lack of control means a password may be retained longer than the user intends or expects, potentially increasing exposure."
What is the fundamental principle of hashed password verification regarding password storage?,"The fundamental principle of hashed password verification is that the verifier, which is the system performing the authentication, does not store the actual passwords. Instead, it only stores their hashes. A **hash** is a fixed-size string of characters generated from a variable-sized input, in this case, a password, using a cryptographic hash function. This ensures that even if the stored hashes are compromised, the original passwords are not directly revealed."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"The process of hashed password verification involves a claimant (user) providing a password to a verifier (system). The verifier then applies a **hash function** (`h`) to the provided password to generate its hash. This newly computed hash is then compared against a pre-stored hash of the user's password in a password table. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the system accepts the password; otherwise, it rejects it. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size value (the hash)."
What are the two main categories of attacks on passwords?,"The two main categories of attacks on passwords are Offline Guessing Attacks and ""Phishing"" and Spoofing. **Offline Guessing Attacks** involve an attacker obtaining hashed passwords and attempting to guess the original passwords without direct interaction with the authentication system. **Phishing** is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, often by impersonating a trustworthy entity. **Spoofing** is when an attacker disguises themselves as a legitimate user or system to gain unauthorized access."
What is an Offline Guessing Attack?,"An Offline Guessing Attack is a type of password attack where an attacker first obtains the hashed passwords from a system and then attempts to guess the original plain-text passwords without needing to interact with the live authentication system. This process typically involves generating potential passwords, hashing them, and comparing the resulting hashes to the stolen ones. A **hashed password** is the output of a cryptographic hash function applied to a password, designed to be one-way (difficult to reverse)."
Why are Offline Guessing Attacks considered a plausible threat?,"Offline Guessing Attacks are considered a plausible threat due to several factors. These include numerous incidents of stolen (hashed) passwords resulting from hacks on servers or sniffing network traffic. Additionally, the widespread practice of users employing the same passwords across different accounts means that the compromise of a password for one account can subsequently affect other accounts, making these attacks more effective."
What are the types of Offline Guessing Attacks?,"Offline Guessing Attacks can be categorized into two main types: Exhaustive attacks and Intelligent attacks. **Exhaustive attacks**, also known as brute-force attacks, systematically try every possible password combination. **Intelligent attacks**, such as Dictionary attacks, use pre-compiled lists of common words, phrases, or previously leaked passwords to guess the target password more efficiently."
What is a Brute Force Attack?,"A Brute Force Attack is a type of guessing attack against passwords where an attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. For each generated password, its hash is computed and then checked against the target hashes that the attacker is trying to crack. If a match is found, the password is considered cracked."
How can the difficulty of a Brute Force Attack be increased?,"The difficulty of a Brute Force Attack can be increased by expanding the 'space' of possible passwords. This is achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing for a greater variety of symbols to be used, including alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs. A larger and more complex password space makes it computationally more intensive and time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all possible combinations."
What role does password policy play in defending against brute force attacks?,"Password policy plays an important role in defending against brute force attacks by establishing rules and requirements for password creation. A strong password policy, which mandates characteristics like minimum length, inclusion of diverse character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular changes, directly increases the difficulties an attacker faces when attempting a brute force attack by expanding the password space."
What is password entropy and how is it measured?,"Password entropy refers to the measure of the unpredictability of a password, indicating how difficult it is to guess or crack. It is measured by `2^k`, where `k` represents the bitsize of the password space. The bitsize is calculated as the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, which is `c^n`, where `c` is the number of choices per character (e.g., character set size) and `n` is the number of characters in the password (password length)."
What is the typical cracking speed of software password crackers?,"At present, software password crackers are capable of cracking passwords at a rate of up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (PC)."
What was a critical vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack related to the SCM database?,"In the SingHealth cyber attack, a critical vulnerability was exploited because the SCM database, which is owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network. This open network was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), creating an exploitable pathway for the attacker."
What monitoring deficiencies were found regarding the SCM database during the SingHealth cyber attack investigation?,"During the investigation into the SingHealth cyber attack, it was found that there was a significant lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access. Specifically, there was no existing control mechanism to detect or block bulk queries being made to the database. Furthermore, the Citrix servers of SGH were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts concerning vulnerabilities and issues."
How was unauthorized access to Citrix servers achieved in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"Unauthorized access to the Citrix servers in the SingHealth cyber attack was achieved because the servers were not adequately secured. Notably, the process requiring 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in as an administrator. This allowed the attacker to access the server through alternative routes that did not require 2FA."
What role did weak administrator account passwords play in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"Weak administrator account passwords were identified as another significant weakness that may have been exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack. These weak passwords were among other vulnerabilities discovered during a test, but the remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leaving these vulnerabilities unaddressed at the time of the attack."
What was the impact of the Adobe data breach?,"The Adobe data breach impacted at least 38 million users, exposing user account information and prompting a large number of password reset emails. The incident also revealed that a massive source code leak at Adobe was broadening to include products from its Photoshop family of graphical design products."
How many LinkedIn passwords were leaked in a notable incident?,"In a notable incident, more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. Although some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords as a precautionary measure."
What was the scale of the Russia gang hack mentioned in the document?,"A Russia-based gang was responsible for hacking 1.2 billion usernames and passwords, indicating a massive scale of credential compromise."
What was the nature of the Pastebin incident mentioned in the document?,"The Pastebin incident involved more than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, being posted on the clipboard website Pastebin.com in 2013. This information was revealed through an analysis by a Swiss security firm."
What vulnerability was found in the Starbucks mobile app regarding user information?,"A vulnerability was discovered in the Starbucks mobile app that could potentially put coffee drinkers' information at risk. This included their usernames, email addresses, and passwords, which were found to be stored in clear text."
What is the purpose of storing password hashes instead of plain-text passwords?,"The purpose of storing password hashes instead of plain-text passwords is to enhance security. By storing only the hashed versions, even if an attacker gains access to the password file, they will only obtain the hashes, not the original passwords. A **hash** is a one-way cryptographic function output, making it computationally infeasible to reverse engineer the original password from its hash."
What is the significance of the `/etc/shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"The `/etc/shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems is significant because it stores password hashes, separating them from the `/etc/passwd` file which contains user account information. This separation enhances security by restricting access to the sensitive password hashes, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to obtain them."
What are the risks associated with passwords being held temporarily in intermediate storage locations?,"The risks associated with passwords being held temporarily in intermediate storage locations, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, stem from the fact that their management is often beyond the user's control. This can lead to passwords being retained for longer than intended, increasing the window of opportunity for an attacker to potentially access them, especially if the application or system is compromised."
Explain the role of a hash function in password verification.,"In password verification, a **hash function** (`h`) plays a crucial role by transforming a user's plain-text password into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. When a user attempts to log in, the system applies the same hash function to the entered password. The resulting hash is then compared to a previously stored hash associated with that user. If they match, authentication is successful. This one-way process ensures that the actual password is never stored or directly exposed."
What is the difference between an exhaustive attack and a dictionary attack?,"An **exhaustive attack**, also known as a brute-force attack, is a type of offline guessing attack that systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. In contrast, a **dictionary attack** is an intelligent attack that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords (a 'dictionary') to guess the target password, making it generally faster than an exhaustive attack if the password is simple or common."
What makes an attack involving sniffing traffic a plausible threat for obtaining hashed passwords?,"An attack involving sniffing traffic is a plausible threat for obtaining hashed passwords because it allows an attacker to intercept network communications. If passwords or their hashes are transmitted over an insecure channel or if an attacker can capture traffic containing authentication data, they can then extract these hashed passwords. Once obtained, these hashes can be subjected to offline guessing attacks to reveal the original passwords."
How does the use of the same passwords across different accounts contribute to the plausibility of offline guessing attacks?,"The use of the same passwords across different accounts significantly contributes to the plausibility of offline guessing attacks because if an attacker compromises a password for one account, they can then use that same password (or its hash) to attempt to gain access to other accounts belonging to the same user. This multiplies the impact of a single successful password compromise, affecting multiple services or systems."
What were the general causes of the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The SingHealth cyber attack was attributed to a combination of human lapses by employees and inherent vulnerabilities within the IT system. These weaknesses ultimately allowed the breach into the public healthcare group's database, despite the attacker being skilled, indicating that the incident was preventable."
What specific issue was identified with the Citrix servers of SGH regarding monitoring?,A specific issue identified with the Citrix servers of SGH was that they were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. This lack of proactive monitoring meant that potential security threats or ongoing attacks on these critical servers could go undetected for extended periods.
What was the consequence of 2-factor authentication not being enforced for administrator access to Citrix servers?,"The consequence of 2-factor authentication (2FA) not being enforced as the exclusive means of logging in as an administrator for Citrix servers was that it allowed the attacker to bypass this security measure. The attacker was able to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA, thereby gaining unauthorized administrative access."
What was the problem with the remediation process undertaken by IHiS after vulnerabilities were discovered in SingHealth?,"The problem with the remediation process undertaken by IHiS after vulnerabilities were discovered in SingHealth was that it was mismanaged and inadequate. As a result, a number of the identified vulnerabilities, including weak administrator account passwords, remained unaddressed at the time the cyber attack occurred, contributing to its success."
What type of information was exposed in the Adobe breach?,The Adobe breach exposed user account information and also involved a broadening source code leak that included the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products.
What advice was given to LinkedIn users after the password leak?,"After the LinkedIn password leak, all users were advised to change their passwords, even though some login details were encrypted. This recommendation was a precautionary measure to mitigate potential risks from the exposed data."
What was the critical vulnerability found in the Starbucks mobile app?,"The critical vulnerability found in the Starbucks mobile app was that it stored user information, including usernames, email addresses, and passwords, in clear text. This means the sensitive data was not encrypted, making it easily readable if accessed by an attacker."
How does increasing the length of a password help against brute force attacks?,"Increasing the length of a password helps against brute force attacks by significantly expanding the 'space' of possible passwords. For each additional character, the number of potential combinations grows exponentially, making it much more computationally intensive and time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all possibilities and find the correct password."
How does allowing more varieties of symbols in passwords help against brute force attacks?,"Allowing more varieties of symbols in passwords, such as alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs, helps against brute force attacks by increasing the character set size (`c`) for each position in the password. This expands the overall password space exponentially, making it much harder for an attacker to guess the password by trying all possible combinations."
What does `c` represent in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, `c` represents the number of choices per character. This refers to the size of the character set from which each character in the password can be drawn, such as lowercase letters, alphanumeric characters, mixed-case alphanumeric characters, or a full set of keyboard characters."
What does `n` represent in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, `n` represents the number of characters in the password, which is essentially the password's length."
What is the meaning of 'bitsize of password space'?,"The 'bitsize of password space' refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. It quantifies the entropy or randomness of a password, indicating how many bits of information are required to represent the password space. A higher bitsize implies a larger and more secure password space, making it harder to guess."
What is the implication of software password crackers being able to crack 16 million passwords per second?,"The implication of software password crackers being able to crack 16 million passwords per second is that passwords with low entropy or short lengths can be compromised very quickly. This highlights the critical need for strong password policies that enforce longer, more complex passwords to increase the time required for a brute-force attack to succeed to an impractical duration."
What is the primary function of the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file in Windows?,"The primary function of the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file in Windows is to store user account information, including password hashes. It is a critical component for authentication and authorization processes within the Windows operating system."
Why is it advised not to save passwords in cache?,"It is advised not to save passwords in cache because caches are intermediate storage locations that can be less secure than dedicated password files. If a system or application's cache is compromised, any passwords stored there in plain text or easily reversible formats could be exposed to attackers, leading to unauthorized access."
What is 'Phishing' in the context of password attacks?,"In the context of password attacks, 'Phishing' is a social engineering technique where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into revealing their sensitive information, such as passwords. This is typically done by impersonating a trusted entity in electronic communication, like an email or a website, to trick users into entering their credentials on a fraudulent site."
What is 'Spoofing' in the context of password attacks?,"In the context of password attacks, 'Spoofing' refers to an attacker disguising themselves as a legitimate user, system, or entity to gain unauthorized access or information. This can involve faking an identity or source to trick a user into revealing their password or to bypass security measures."
What kind of data is typically targeted in Offline Guessing Attacks?,"In Offline Guessing Attacks, the data typically targeted are hashed passwords. Attackers aim to obtain these hashed passwords from compromised servers or by sniffing network traffic, and then attempt to reverse them to find the original plain-text passwords."
What is the relationship between `c^n` and password entropy?,"The relationship between `c^n` and password entropy is direct: `c^n` represents the total number of possible passwords given `c` choices per character and `n` characters in the password. Password entropy, specifically its bitsize, is then calculated as the base-2 logarithm of this `c^n` value. A larger `c^n` indicates a greater number of possible passwords and thus higher entropy, making the password more secure."
