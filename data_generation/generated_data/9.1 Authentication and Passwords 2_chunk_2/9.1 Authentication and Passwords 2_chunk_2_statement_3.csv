Define the concept of password storage in operating systems.,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a password file. A password hash is a one-way cryptographic function applied to a password, producing a fixed-size string of characters that is computationally infeasible to reverse. This hash is stored instead of the plain-text password for security reasons."
Where are passwords stored in a Windows system?,"In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. The specific path for this file is typically `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`. The SAM file contains hashed versions of user passwords and other security-related information."
"Explain how passwords are stored in Unix/Linux systems, distinguishing between older and modern approaches.","In older Unix systems, password hashes were stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, for enhanced security, password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`. The `shadow` file is typically only readable by the root user, protecting password hashes from unauthorized access."
Describe intermediate storage locations where passwords might be held at the application level.,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even within a web page. Buffers are temporary data storage areas used to hold data while it is being transferred from one place to another. Caches are hardware or software components that store data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. Storing passwords in such locations, especially in a web page cache, is generally advised against due to security risks."
What are the implications of passwords being held in intermediate storage locations beyond the user's control?,"The management of intermediate storage locations, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, is normally beyond the control of the user. This means that a password, even if intended for temporary use, may be kept longer in these locations than the user has anticipated or ""bargained for,"" increasing the window of opportunity for potential compromise if these locations are accessed by an attacker."
What is the fundamental principle a verifier should follow regarding password storage during hashed password verification?,"The fundamental principle a verifier (system) should follow during hashed password verification is that it does not store the actual passwords, only their hashes. A hash is the output of a one-way cryptographic function, meaning it's easy to compute the hash from the password but computationally infeasible to derive the original password from the hash. This prevents an attacker from obtaining plain-text passwords even if they gain access to the verifier's password database."
Outline the process of hashed password verification as depicted in the provided diagram.,"The process of hashed password verification involves a Claimant A attempting to authenticate to a Verifier (system) B. The Verifier B maintains a ""Password table"" that stores the hash of each user's password (e.g., h(password_A) for Claimant A). When Claimant A provides a password (password_A), the Verifier B applies a hash function (h) to this provided password to compute h(password). This newly computed hash is then compared to the stored hash (h(password_A)) in the Password table. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the system outputs ""yes"" and accepts the authentication. If they do not match, the system outputs ""no"" and rejects the authentication."
"Define ""Claimant A"" in the context of hashed password verification.","In the context of hashed password verification, ""Claimant A"" refers to the entity (e.g., a user) who is attempting to prove their identity by providing a password. This entity initiates the authentication process by submitting their credentials to the system."
"Define ""Verifier (system) B"" in the context of hashed password verification.","In the context of hashed password verification, ""Verifier (system) B"" refers to the system or application responsible for authenticating the Claimant A. This system stores password hashes in a password table and performs the comparison between the hash of the provided password and the stored hash to determine acceptance or rejection of the authentication attempt."
"Explain the role of the ""Password table"" in hashed password verification.","The ""Password table"" in hashed password verification is a database or data structure maintained by the Verifier (system) B. It stores the pre-computed hashes of legitimate user passwords. For each user (e.g., Claimant A), the table contains their identifier and the corresponding hash of their password, such as h(password_A). This table is crucial for comparing the hash of a newly provided password against the stored, correct hash."
"What is a ""Hash function"" and what is its purpose in hashed password verification?","A ""Hash function"" (denoted as h in the diagram) is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (in this case, a password) and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is the hash value. Its purpose in hashed password verification is to transform the plain-text password provided by the user into a hash, which can then be securely compared against the stored hash in the password table. A good hash function is one-way, meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original password from its hash."
List the two main categories of attacks on passwords.,"The two main categories of attacks on passwords are ""Offline Guessing Attacks"" and ""Phishing"" and ""Spoofing."""
"Define ""Offline Guessing Attacks"" in the context of password security.","An ""Offline Guessing Attack"" is a type of attack where the attacker obtains the hashed passwords from a system and then attempts to guess the original plain-text passwords by computing hashes of guessed passwords and comparing them to the stolen hashes. This attack is performed ""offline"" because it does not require direct interaction with the live authentication system."
What are the two types of Offline Guessing Attacks mentioned?,"The two types of Offline Guessing Attacks mentioned are ""Exhaustive attacks"" and ""Intelligent attacks: Dictionary attacks."""
"Describe ""Exhaustive attacks"" as a type of Offline Guessing Attack.","""Exhaustive attacks,"" also known as brute-force attacks, are a type of Offline Guessing Attack where the attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters (alphabets, numerals, signs) to guess a password. The attacker computes the hash for each combination and compares it against the stolen hashed passwords until a match is found."
"Describe ""Intelligent attacks: Dictionary attacks"" as a type of Offline Guessing Attack.","""Intelligent attacks: Dictionary attacks"" are a type of Offline Guessing Attack where the attacker attempts to guess passwords by trying a predefined list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords (a ""dictionary""). This method is more efficient than exhaustive attacks for common or weak passwords because it focuses on likely candidates first."
"Provide a detailed explanation of how an Offline Guessing Attack proceeds, including the steps involved.","An Offline Guessing Attack proceeds in several steps. First, the attacker obtains the hashed passwords from a target system. This typically happens through hacks on servers or by sniffing network traffic. Once the attacker has the ""Hashed Text"" (the stolen password hashes), they then attempt to guess the original ""Plain Text"" passwords. For each guess, the attacker applies a ""Hash Function"" to the guessed plain text to produce a new hash. This newly computed hash is then compared against the stolen ""Hashed Text."" If a match is found, the attacker has successfully recovered the original password. This process is repeated until passwords are cracked or the attacker gives up."
Why is an Offline Guessing Attack considered a plausible threat?,"An Offline Guessing Attack is considered a plausible threat due to several factors. Firstly, there are many incidents where stolen (hashed) passwords are obtained as a consequence of hacks on servers or by sniffing network traffic. Secondly, users often reuse the same passwords across different accounts. This means that if a password for one account is compromised through an offline guessing attack, it can affect other accounts belonging to the same user, making the attack more impactful."
"What is the risk associated with users employing the same passwords across different accounts, particularly in the context of Offline Guessing Attacks?","The risk associated with users employing the same passwords across different accounts is significant, especially in the context of Offline Guessing Attacks. If an attacker successfully compromises a password for one account, for example, by cracking a stolen hash, that same password might be valid for other accounts belonging to the user. This means that the compromise of a single password can affect multiple accounts, leading to broader security breaches."
"According to the document, what were the primary causes of the SingHealth cyber attack?","According to the document, the SingHealth cyber attack was a result of human lapses and IT system weaknesses. These factors ultimately led to the breach into the public healthcare group's database, which was deemed preventable despite the attacker's skill."
Identify a critical vulnerability exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth incident related to the SCM database.,"A critical vulnerability exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth incident was related to the SCM database. The SCM database, owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH). This open network linkage created a critical vulnerability that the attacker successfully exploited to obtain data."
What weaknesses were identified in the monitoring of the SCM database during the SingHealth cyber attack?,"During the SingHealth cyber attack, a lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access was identified as a weakness. Specifically, there was no existing control to detect or block bulk queries being made to the database. Additionally, the Citrix servers of SGH were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from these servers."
"How did the attacker gain unauthorized administrator access in the SingHealth incident, specifically regarding 2-factor authentication?","The attacker gained unauthorized administrator access in the SingHealth incident because the Citrix servers were not adequately secured. Notably, the process requiring 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in as an administrator. This allowed the attacker to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA, bypassing a crucial security measure."
What specific password-related weakness was among those exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"A specific password-related weakness that may have been exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack included weak administrator account passwords. This weakness was discovered during a test, but the remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leaving these vulnerabilities present at the time of the attack."
What was the role of IHiS in the remediation process following the discovery of vulnerabilities in the SingHealth system?,"In the SingHealth incident, IHiS was responsible for the remediation process following the discovery of vulnerabilities. However, this process was mismanaged and inadequate, resulting in a number of vulnerabilities, including weak administrator account passwords, remaining unaddressed at the time of the cyber attack."
What was the reported impact of the Adobe data breach in October 2013?,The Adobe data breach in October 2013 reportedly impacted at least 38 million users. This incident exposed user account information and prompted a flurry of password reset emails. The breach also appeared to broaden to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products.
How many LinkedIn passwords were leaked online in the incident reported in June 2012?,"In the incident reported in June 2012, more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. Although some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords."
Describe the vulnerability found in the Starbucks mobile app concerning user information.,"A vulnerability was found in the Starbucks' mobile app that could be putting coffee drinkers' information at risk. This information included their usernames, email addresses, and passwords, which were stored in clear text. Storing passwords in clear text means they are unencrypted and easily readable, posing a significant security risk."
"What kind of credentials were posted to Pastebin in 2013, according to a Swiss security firm's analysis?","According to a recent analysis by a Swiss security firm, more than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted on the clipboard website Pastebin.com in the year 2013 alone."
"What was the scale of the ""Russia gang"" hack reported in August 2014?","The ""Russia gang"" hack, reported in August 2014, involved the compromise of 1.2 billion usernames and passwords."
Define a Brute Force Attack against passwords.,A Brute Force Attack against passwords is a guessing attack that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks whether these generated hashes match the target hashes (stolen password hashes).
How does a brute force attack attempt to find a password?,"A brute force attack attempts to find a password by systematically trying every possible combination of characters. For each combination, it computes the hash of that potential password and compares it against the target hash. If a match is found, the original password has been successfully guessed. This process continues until a match is made or all possibilities are exhausted."
What is a key measure to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"A key measure to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack is to increase the ""space of possible passwords."" This can be achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs. More complex and longer passwords significantly increase the number of combinations an attacker must try."
What role does a password policy play in mitigating brute force attacks?,"A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing rules such as minimum length, complexity requirements (e.g., requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols), and disallowing common or easily guessable passwords, a strong password policy significantly expands the ""password space,"" making it much harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to successfully guess a password through brute force."
How is password entropy measured according to the document?,"According to the document, password entropy is measured by 2^k, where k represents the ""bitsize of password space."" The bitsize of password space is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, given n characters and c choices per character, calculated as log2(c^n)."
"Explain the concept of ""bitsize of password space"" in relation to password entropy.","The ""bitsize of password space"" refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords for a given set of parameters. If there are n characters in a password and c choices (e.g., types of characters like lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) available for each character position, the total number of possible passwords is c^n. The bitsize k is then calculated as log2(c^n). A higher bitsize indicates greater password entropy, meaning more possible combinations and thus a stronger, harder-to-guess password."
What factors influence the bitsize of password space?,"The bitsize of password space is influenced by two primary factors: the length of the password (n characters) and the number of available character choices per position (c). Increasing either the password length or the variety of characters allowed (e.g., from only lowercase to mixed case alphanumeric plus symbols) will increase the total number of possible passwords (c^n) and consequently increase the bitsize of the password space."
What is the current cracking speed of software password crackers mentioned in the document?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc). This high cracking speed underscores the importance of strong password policies and high password entropy to resist brute-force attacks."
"How can one calculate the time it would take to brute-force passwords for a given entry, considering the cracking speed?","To calculate how long it will take to brute-force passwords for a given entry, one would need to know the total number of possible passwords (derived from the bitsize of password space, 2^k) and the cracking speed of the software password cracker (e.g., 16 million passwords per second per pc). The total number of possible passwords would be divided by the cracking speed to estimate the time required. For example, if the bitsize is k, the number of possibilities is 2^k. If the cracking speed is S passwords/second, the time would be (2^k) / S seconds."
Provide the bitsize of password space for a 7-character password using only lowercase alphanumeric characters.,"For a 7-character password using only lowercase alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of password space is 36.2. This is derived from a character set of 36 choices (26 lowercase letters + 10 numerals) and a password length of 7 characters."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 9-character password composed of mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For a 9-character password composed of mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of password space is 53.6. This is based on a character set of 62 choices (26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 10 numerals) and a password length of 9 characters."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password using 26 lowercase characters versus 95 keyboard characters.,"For a 5-character password, using 26 lowercase characters results in a bitsize of 23.5. In contrast, using 95 keyboard characters (a much larger character set) for a 5-character password results in a significantly higher bitsize of 32.9. This demonstrates that increasing the variety of characters available (c) has a substantial impact on password entropy, even for the same password length."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 10-character password using 95 keyboard characters?,"For a 10-character password using 95 keyboard characters, the bitsize of password space is 65.7. This represents a very high level of entropy due to both the length and the extensive character set."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 6-character password using only lowercase characters?,"For a 6-character password using only lowercase characters, the bitsize of password space is 28.2. This is based on a character set of 26 choices (lowercase letters) and a password length of 6 characters."
What is the bitsize of password space for an 8-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters?,"For an 8-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of password space is 41.4. This is based on a character set of 36 choices (26 lowercase letters + 10 numerals) and a password length of 8 characters."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of password space is 41.7. This is based on a character set of 62 choices (26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 10 numerals) and a password length of 7 characters."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 9-character password using 95 keyboard characters?,"For a 9-character password using 95 keyboard characters, the bitsize of password space is 59.1. This indicates a strong password due to the combination of length and a broad character set."
How does increasing password length from 5 to 10 characters impact the bitsize of password space when using 26 lowercase characters?,"Increasing password length from 5 to 10 characters significantly impacts the bitsize of password space when using 26 lowercase characters. For a 5-character password, the bitsize is 23.5, while for a 10-character password, it increases to 47.0. This demonstrates a substantial increase in entropy and difficulty for brute-force attacks by simply doubling the password length, even with a limited character set."
How does expanding the character set from lowercase alphanumeric (36 choices) to mixed case alphanumeric (62 choices) affect the bitsize for an 8-character password?,"Expanding the character set from lowercase alphanumeric (36 choices) to mixed case alphanumeric (62 choices) significantly increases the bitsize for an 8-character password. With 36 lowercase alphanumeric choices, the bitsize is 41.4. When using 62 mixed case alphanumeric choices, the bitsize increases to 47.6. This shows that a broader character set contributes substantially to password strength and entropy."
What is the primary security concern regarding passwords stored in intermediate locations like caches?,"The primary security concern regarding passwords stored in intermediate locations like caches is that these locations are normally beyond the control of the user. This means that a password, even if intended for temporary use, might persist longer than desired, creating an extended window of vulnerability where an attacker could potentially access the password from these less secure, temporary storage areas."
