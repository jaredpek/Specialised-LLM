Compare the storage locations of passwords in Windows systems with those in Unix/Linux systems.,"In Windows systems, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, specifically located at `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`. In contrast, in Unix systems, password hashes were traditionally stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, these hashes are now stored in the more secure `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`. The SAM file, `/etc/passwd`, and `/etc/shadow` are all examples of password files at the operating system level."
What are the differences in password hash storage between traditional Unix and modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In traditional Unix systems, password hashes were stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file, which is located at `/etc/shadow`. This change was made to enhance security, as the `shadow` file typically has more restricted permissions, making the password hashes less accessible to unauthorized users compared to the `/etc/passwd` file."
Compare how passwords are stored at the operating system level versus at the application level.,"At the operating system level, password hashes are stored in dedicated password files. For instance, in Windows, this is the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file (`%windir%\system32\config\SAM`), and in modern Unix/Linux, it's the `shadow` file (`/etc/shadow`). These are intended for persistent storage. In contrast, at the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even a web page. These temporary storage locations are generally beyond the control of the user, meaning a password might be retained longer than intended."
"Explain the differences between buffers, caches, and web pages as temporary storage locations for passwords at the application level.","Buffers, caches, and web pages are all intermediate storage locations where passwords may be held temporarily at the application level. A `buffer` is a temporary storage area used to hold data while it's being moved from one place to another. A `cache` is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster. A `web page` can temporarily store password information, for example, if a browser's autofill feature is enabled or if the password is inadvertently saved in the browser's local storage. The key commonality is their temporary nature and that their management is normally beyond the direct control of the user, potentially keeping passwords longer than expected."
Compare the level of user control over password storage at the operating system level versus temporary storage locations at the application level.,"At the operating system level, password storage locations, such as the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file in Windows or the `shadow` file in Unix/Linux, are managed by the operating system, and users typically interact with them through system-level utilities or authentication processes. While users set their passwords, the direct management of these files is not typically a user-controlled action. In contrast, at the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations like buffers, caches, or a web page. The management of these specific temporary storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user, meaning a password may be kept longer than the user has bargained for, often without their explicit knowledge or consent."
Compare the roles of Claimant A and Verifier (system) B in the hashed password verification process.,"In the hashed password verification process, `Claimant A` is the entity that provides a password for authentication. `Verifier (system) B` is the system responsible for verifying this password. The Verifier does not store the actual password provided by Claimant A; instead, it stores only the hash of the password (`h(password_A)`) in its password table. When Claimant A provides a password, Verifier B computes its hash (`h(password)`) and compares it against the stored hash to determine acceptance or rejection."
What is the fundamental difference between storing passwords and storing password hashes for verification?,"The fundamental difference is that storing `passwords` means keeping the actual, plain-text credentials, which poses a significant security risk if the storage is compromised. In contrast, storing `password hashes` means keeping a one-way cryptographic transformation of the password. The verifier (system) B does not (and should not) store the actual passwords, only their hashes. This way, even if an attacker gains access to the stored hashes, they do not immediately obtain the original passwords, making it much harder to compromise user accounts."
Compare the information stored in a password table with the information provided by a claimant during hashed password verification.,"In hashed password verification, the `password table` within the Verifier (system) B stores the hash of a user's password, denoted as `h(password_A)`. This is a one-way cryptographic representation of the actual password. Conversely, the `Claimant A` provides the actual `password_A` (in plain text) during the verification process. The Verifier then computes the hash of the provided password and compares it to the stored hash, rather than comparing the plain-text password directly."
Describe the conditions that lead to an 'ACCEPT' versus a 'REJECT' outcome in hashed password verification.,"In hashed password verification, an 'ACCEPT' outcome occurs when the hash of the password provided by `Claimant A` (`h(password)`) exactly matches the `h(password_A)` stored in the `Verifier (system) B`'s password table. This indicates successful authentication. Conversely, a 'REJECT' outcome occurs if the hash of the provided password does not match the stored hash, signifying that the password entered is incorrect and authentication has failed."
Compare Offline Guessing Attacks with 'Phishing' and Spoofing as methods of attacking passwords.,"`Offline Guessing Attacks` are a type of attack where the attacker first obtains the hashed passwords (e.g., from a compromised server) and then attempts to guess the original plain-text passwords by hashing their guesses and comparing them to the stolen hashes. This attack does not require direct interaction with the user or the live authentication system. In contrast, `'Phishing' and Spoofing` are social engineering attacks that involve tricking users into revealing their passwords or other sensitive information, often by impersonating a trustworthy entity. These attacks typically involve direct interaction with the user, such as through deceptive emails or fake websites, rather than directly compromising stored password hashes."
Compare exhaustive attacks with dictionary attacks in the context of offline guessing attacks.,"Both `exhaustive attacks` and `dictionary attacks` are types of offline guessing attacks. An `exhaustive attack`, also known as a brute force attack, attempts to guess a password by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method is comprehensive but can be very time-consuming. A `dictionary attack`, on the other hand, is an intelligent attack that attempts to guess passwords by using a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords (a 'dictionary'). This method is faster than an exhaustive attack if the password is a common word or phrase, but it will fail if the password is not in the dictionary."
Compare the role of Plain Text and Hashed Text in an offline guessing attack.,"In an `offline guessing attack`, the attacker first obtains the `hashed passwords` (Hashed Text) from a compromised system. The goal is to discover the original `Plain Text` passwords. The attacker does this by guessing potential Plain Text passwords, applying a `hash function` to each guess to generate a corresponding Hashed Text, and then comparing this generated Hashed Text with the stolen Hashed Text. A match indicates that the guessed Plain Text password is correct."
Compare hacks on servers with sniffing traffic as methods leading to stolen passwords.,"Both `hacks on servers` and `sniffing traffic` are plausible threats that can lead to the compromise and theft of hashed passwords. `Hacks on servers` involve an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a server where password files (containing hashed passwords) are stored, directly exfiltrating these files. `Sniffing traffic` involves an attacker intercepting network communications to capture data packets, which might contain passwords or password hashes if they are transmitted insecurely. While both result in stolen (hashed) passwords, server hacks target the storage location, whereas traffic sniffing targets data in transit."
Explain the difference in impact when a password for one account is compromised versus when the same password is used across different accounts.,"If a password for `one account` is compromised, the impact is generally limited to that specific account. The attacker gains access only to the resources associated with that single account. However, if the `same password is used across different accounts`, the compromise of that one password can have a much broader impact. An attacker who obtains this single password can then potentially access all other accounts where the user has reused the same password, leading to a cascading compromise across multiple services or platforms. This significantly amplifies the damage from a single password breach."
Compare the /etc/passwd file with the /etc/shadow file in modern Unix/Linux systems regarding password hash storage.,"In Unix systems, the `/etc/passwd` file traditionally stored password hashes. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are now stored in the `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`. The `/etc/passwd` file still exists but typically stores user account information without the actual password hashes, which are moved to `/etc/shadow` for enhanced security. The `shadow` file has stricter permissions, usually readable only by the root user, making it much harder for unprivileged users or attackers to access the hashed passwords."
Compare the roles of lapses by employees and vulnerabilities with the system in contributing to the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The SingHealth cyber attack was a result of both `human lapses by employees` and `vulnerabilities with the system`. Lapses by employees refer to failures in human actions or adherence to security protocols, such as mismanaged remediation processes or inadequate security practices. Vulnerabilities with the system refer to inherent weaknesses or flaws in the network and SCM (Supply Chain Management) system, such as the SCM database functioning on an open network, inadequately secured Citrix servers, or a lack of monitoring. Both categories of issues contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and taking data, making the breach preventable despite the attacker's skill."
Compare the vulnerabilities associated with the SCM database on an open network with those of the Citrix servers in the SingHealth incident.,"In the SingHealth incident, the `SCM database` was found to be functioning on an open network, which was linked to the `Citrix servers` of Singapore General Hospital (SGH). This open network connection created a critical vulnerability that the attacker exploited. Specific vulnerabilities related to the SCM database included a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access, with no existing control to detect or block bulk queries. For the Citrix servers, weaknesses included not being adequately secured against unauthorized access, specifically the non-enforcement of 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access, allowing attackers to bypass it through other routes. Additionally, the Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities."
What were the differences in monitoring deficiencies related to the SCM database and the Citrix servers in the SingHealth attack?,"In the SingHealth attack, monitoring deficiencies differed for the SCM database and the Citrix servers. For the `SCM database`, there was a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access, specifically no existing control to detect or block bulk queries being made to the database. For the `Citrix servers` of SGH, the deficiency was that they were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from these servers. Both represent critical gaps in security oversight that contributed to the attacker's success."
Compare the weakness of administrator access not enforcing 2-factor authentication with the use of weak administrator account passwords in the SingHealth incident.,"In the SingHealth incident, both the lack of `2-factor authentication (2FA)` enforcement for administrator access and the use of `weak administrator account passwords` were significant weaknesses. The non-enforcement of 2FA meant that administrator access was not exclusively protected by a second verification step, allowing the attacker to access servers through other routes that did not require 2FA. Weak administrator account passwords, on the other hand, made it easier for the attacker to guess or crack these credentials directly. While 2FA enforcement is a procedural control to add a layer of security, weak passwords are a fundamental credential vulnerability. Both were exploited, and the remediation process for weak passwords was mismanaged and inadequate."
Compare the preventability of the SingHealth breach with the skill level of the attacker.,"The SingHealth breach was ultimately deemed `preventable`, despite the attacker being `skilled`. The report indicated that the breach occurred due to lapses by employees and vulnerabilities within the system. This suggests that even with a skilled adversary, robust security measures, proper employee training, and timely remediation of identified vulnerabilities could have prevented the incident. The attacker's skill was a factor in exploiting weaknesses, but the underlying issues that allowed the exploitation were within the control of the organization."
Compare the scale of user impact in the Adobe breach with the LinkedIn password leak.,"The `Adobe breach` impacted at least 38 million users, exposing user account information and prompting a flurry of password reset emails. In contrast, the `LinkedIn password leak` involved more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords that leaked to the Web. Therefore, the Adobe breach affected a significantly larger number of users in terms of account information exposure compared to the LinkedIn leak, although both were substantial security incidents."
Compare the state of leaked passwords in the LinkedIn incident with those exposed by the Starbucks app vulnerability.,"In the `LinkedIn incident`, though some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords. This implies that while some passwords might have been hashed or otherwise protected, others might have been vulnerable. In stark contrast, the `Starbucks app vulnerability` explicitly stored user information, including usernames, email addresses, and passwords, in `clear text`. Storing passwords in clear text means they are unencrypted and immediately readable, posing a much higher and more direct risk of compromise upon exposure."
Compare the scale of credentials compromised in the Russia gang hack with those posted to Pastebin.,"The `Russia gang hack` was a massive incident, compromising 1.2 billion usernames and passwords. This represents an extremely large-scale data breach. In comparison, the `Pastebin posting` involved over 300,000 credentials, usernames, and passwords posted to the clipboard website Pastebin.com in 2013. While 300,000 is a significant number, it is considerably smaller in scale than the 1.2 billion credentials compromised by the Russia gang."
Compare the general user account information exposed by the Starbucks app vulnerability with the specific issue of passwords being stored in clear text.,"The `Starbucks app vulnerability` put coffee drinkers' `user information` at risk, which broadly included their usernames, email addresses, and passwords. The `specific issue` highlighted was that these `passwords were stored in clear text`. This means that the passwords were not encrypted and were directly readable, making them highly vulnerable if the stored data was accessed by an attacker. While the exposure of general user information is a privacy concern, the storage of passwords in clear text is a critical security flaw that directly facilitates account compromise."
Compare a brute force attack with a password policy as a means of password security.,"A `brute force attack` is an offensive method where an attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence until a match is found. It is a method of compromising passwords. In contrast, a `password policy` is a defensive measure, an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. It sets rules for password creation, such as requiring longer passwords or a greater variety of symbols, thereby increasing the 'space of possible passwords' and making brute force attacks more computationally intensive and time-consuming."
Describe the two main steps involved in a brute force guessing attack against passwords.,"A `brute force guessing attack` against passwords primarily involves two main steps. First, the attacker attempts to `guess password by enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence`. This means systematically generating every possible password combination and computing its corresponding hash. Second, the attacker `checks whether they match the target hashes`. The generated hash for each guessed password is compared against the stolen hashed passwords obtained from a compromised system. If a match is found, the attacker has successfully identified an original password."
Compare increasing password length with increasing the variety of symbols as measures against brute force attacks.,"Both `increasing password length` and `increasing the variety of symbols` are effective measures against brute force attacks because they both increase the 'space of possible passwords'. Increasing password length (`n`) means adding more characters to the password, which exponentially increases the number of possible combinations. Increasing the variety of symbols (`c`), by allowing alphabets, numerals, and signs, expands the character set from which each position in the password can be chosen. Both strategies make it significantly harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all possible password combinations in a brute force attack."
Compare the process of a brute force attack with the process of hashed password verification.,"The `process of a brute force attack` is an offensive, exhaustive guessing method where an attacker systematically generates potential passwords, hashes them, and compares these generated hashes against stolen password hashes to find a match. This is done without direct interaction with the live authentication system. In contrast, the `process of hashed password verification` is a legitimate, defensive authentication mechanism. A claimant provides a password, the system hashes it, and then compares this newly generated hash against a securely stored hash of the user's actual password to confirm identity. The verifier does not store the original password, only its hash."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password using only lowercase characters versus using lowercase alphanumeric characters.,"For a 5-character password, using only `lowercase characters` (26 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 23.5 bits. If the password uses `lowercase alphanumeric characters` (36 choices per character, including numbers), the bitsize of password space increases to 25.9 bits. This demonstrates that expanding the character set, even for the same password length, increases the entropy and thus the difficulty of guessing the password through brute force."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters versus mixed case alphanumeric characters.,"For a 5-character password, using `lowercase alphanumeric characters` (36 choices per character) yields a bitsize of password space of 25.9 bits. If the password uses `mixed case alphanumeric characters` (62 choices per character, including both uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers), the bitsize of password space increases to 29.8 bits. This shows that incorporating mixed case characters significantly enhances the password's entropy and resistance to brute force attacks."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters versus keyboard characters.,"For a 5-character password, using `mixed case alphanumeric characters` (62 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 29.8 bits. If the password uses `keyboard characters` (95 choices per character, including symbols), the bitsize of password space further increases to 32.9 bits. This illustrates that utilizing a broader range of characters, including special symbols, provides the highest level of entropy for a given password length, making it more robust against guessing attacks."
"Compare the impact of increasing password length from 5 characters to 10 characters on the bitsize of password space, assuming only lowercase characters are used.","When using only `lowercase characters` (26 choices per character), increasing the password length from 5 characters to 10 characters has a significant impact on the bitsize of password space. A 5-character password has a bitsize of 23.5 bits. Doubling the length to a 10-character password increases the bitsize to 47.0 bits. This demonstrates that password length is a critical factor in increasing the entropy and thus the difficulty of brute-forcing a password, as the bitsize roughly doubles when the length doubles for the same character set."
Compare the impact of increasing the number of character choices from 26 (lowercase) to 95 (keyboard characters) on the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password.,"For a 5-character password, increasing the number of `character choices` from 26 (only lowercase) to 95 (keyboard characters) significantly increases the bitsize of password space. With 26 lowercase choices, the bitsize is 23.5 bits. With 95 keyboard character choices, the bitsize increases to 32.9 bits. This illustrates that expanding the character set available for password creation, even for a fixed length, substantially enhances the password's entropy and its resistance to brute force attacks."
Compare the speed of current software password crackers with the general concept of a brute force attack.,"The `general concept of a brute force attack` involves systematically trying every possible password combination. The `speed of current software password crackers` quantifies how quickly this can be done. At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc). This high speed means that even seemingly complex passwords can be vulnerable if their entropy (bitsize of password space) is not sufficiently high, underscoring the need for strong password policies to increase the time required for a brute force attack to succeed."
"Compare `c^n` in password space calculation with its base-2 logarithm, which is the bitsize.","In password space calculation, `c^n` represents the `total number of possible passwords`, where `c` is the number of choices per character and `n` is the password length. This value can be very large. The `base-2 logarithm of c^n` is referred to as the `bitsize of password space` (or entropy). The bitsize quantifies the strength of the password space in terms of how many bits are needed to uniquely represent all possible passwords. A higher bitsize indicates greater entropy and thus a stronger password space, making it more resistant to brute force attacks."
Compare the bitsize for a 6-character lowercase password versus a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 6-character password, using only `lowercase characters` (26 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 28.2 bits. If the password uses `mixed case alphanumeric characters` (62 choices per character), the bitsize of password space increases to 35.7 bits. This comparison highlights the significant security advantage gained by including both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers, even for the same password length, due to the expanded character set."
Compare the bitsize for a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password versus a 7-character keyboard characters password.,"For a 7-character password, using `lowercase alphanumeric characters` (36 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 36.2 bits. If the password uses `keyboard characters` (95 choices per character, including symbols), the bitsize of password space increases to 46.0 bits. This demonstrates that incorporating a wider range of characters, including special symbols available on a keyboard, substantially increases the entropy and thus the strength of the password against brute force attacks for a given length."
Compare the bitsize for an 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password versus an 8-character keyboard characters password.,"For an 8-character password, using `mixed case alphanumeric characters` (62 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 47.6 bits. If the password uses `keyboard characters` (95 choices per character), the bitsize of password space increases to 52.6 bits. This illustrates that for a given password length, maximizing the character set to include all available keyboard characters (alphabets, numerals, and signs) provides the highest possible entropy and strongest defense against brute force attacks."
Compare the bitsize for a 9-character lowercase password versus a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password.,"For a 9-character password, using only `lowercase characters` (26 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 42.3 bits. If the password uses `lowercase alphanumeric characters` (36 choices per character), the bitsize of password space increases to 46.5 bits. This shows that even a modest expansion of the character set, such as adding numbers to lowercase letters, can provide a noticeable increase in password entropy and security for the same password length."
Compare the bitsize for a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password versus a 10-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 10-character password, using `lowercase alphanumeric characters` (36 choices per character) results in a bitsize of password space of 51.7 bits. If the password uses `mixed case alphanumeric characters` (62 choices per character), the bitsize of password space increases to 59.5 bits. This comparison underscores the significant security benefit of incorporating mixed case letters in addition to numbers and lowercase letters, as it substantially increases the number of possible combinations and thus the password's resistance to brute force attacks."
Compare the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file in Windows with the /etc/shadow file in modern Unix/Linux systems.,"Both the `Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file` in Windows and the `/etc/shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems serve as primary storage locations for password hashes at the operating system level. The SAM file is located at `%windir%\system32\config\SAM` in Windows. The `/etc/shadow` file is located at `/etc/shadow` in modern Unix/Linux. Both are critical components for user authentication, storing password hashes rather than plain-text passwords to enhance security, though their specific implementations and access controls are OS-dependent."
Compare the security implications of storing password hashes versus storing actual passwords.,"Storing `password hashes` is significantly more secure than storing `actual passwords` (in plain text). If actual passwords are stored and the system is compromised, an attacker immediately gains access to all user credentials. However, if only password hashes are stored, even if an attacker obtains these hashes, they still need to perform a brute force or dictionary attack to guess the original plain-text passwords. The verifier (system) B is explicitly designed not to store the actual passwords, only their hashes, which is a fundamental security principle to protect user credentials."
Compare the nature of password compromise resulting from hacks on servers versus that from sniffing traffic.,"Password compromise resulting from `hacks on servers` typically involves an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the server's file system or database where password hashes are stored. This allows for direct exfiltration of the password file. In contrast, compromise from `sniffing traffic` involves an attacker intercepting network communications. If passwords or hashes are transmitted insecurely (e.g., without encryption), they can be captured during transit. Both methods lead to stolen (hashed) passwords, but server hacks target data at rest, while traffic sniffing targets data in motion."
Compare the specific vulnerabilities identified in the SingHealth incident related to the SCM database versus those related to the Citrix servers.,"In the SingHealth incident, vulnerabilities related to the `SCM database` included its functioning on an open network linked to Citrix servers, and a lack of monitoring for unusual queries or controls to block bulk queries. For the `Citrix servers`, specific vulnerabilities were that they were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, and crucially, 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in. This allowed attackers to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA. Additionally, the Citrix servers lacked real-time monitoring for vulnerabilities and issues."
Compare the type of information exposed in the Adobe breach with the Starbucks app vulnerability.,"The `Adobe breach` exposed `user account information` for at least 38 million users, which prompted password reset emails. This suggests that while account details were compromised, the passwords themselves might have been hashed or otherwise protected, requiring users to reset them. In contrast, the `Starbucks app vulnerability` explicitly put coffee drinkers' `user information`, including usernames, email addresses, and `passwords in clear text`, at risk. The key difference is that the Starbucks vulnerability directly exposed unencrypted passwords, a more severe security flaw than the Adobe breach where passwords likely required further cracking or resetting."
Compare the general concept of Offline Guessing Attacks with a Brute Force Attack.,"An `Offline Guessing Attack` is a broad category of attack where an attacker obtains hashed passwords from a compromised system and then attempts to guess the original plain-text passwords without interacting with the live authentication system. A `Brute Force Attack` is a specific type of offline guessing attack. It involves systematically trying every single possible combination of characters for a password, hashing each guess, and comparing it to the stolen hashes until a match is found. While all brute force attacks are offline guessing attacks, not all offline guessing attacks are brute force (e.g., dictionary attacks are also a type of offline guessing attack)."
Compare the security implications of storing password hashes in `/etc/passwd` versus `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems.,"Storing password hashes in `/etc/passwd` historically posed a security risk because `/etc/passwd` is typically readable by all users on a Unix/Linux system. This meant that any user could potentially access the hashed passwords, making them vulnerable to offline guessing attacks. In contrast, storing password hashes in `/etc/shadow` in modern Unix/Linux systems significantly enhances security. The `/etc/shadow` file has much stricter permissions, usually readable only by the root user, thereby restricting access to the password hashes and making it much harder for unprivileged users or attackers to obtain them."
Compare the user's control over temporary password storage locations with their expectation of how long a password might be kept.,"A user's `expectation of how long a password might be kept` typically aligns with the duration of their active session or until they explicitly log out. However, `user control over temporary password storage locations` like buffers, caches, or web pages at the application level is normally beyond their direct influence. This lack of control means that a password may be inadvertently retained in these intermediate storage locations for a period longer than the user has bargained for or expects, potentially exposing it to risk if the application or system is compromised later."
Compare a general password policy with specific measures like increasing password length and character variety as ways to increase difficulties of brute force attacks.,"A `general password policy` is an overarching framework designed to increase the difficulties of brute force attacks by setting rules for password creation. `Specific measures` like increasing password length and character variety are concrete implementations or components of such a policy. Increasing password length directly expands the number of possible combinations (`c^n`), while increasing character variety (e.g., using alphabets, numerals, signs) expands the character set (`c`). Both specific measures contribute to increasing the 'space of possible passwords', which is the primary goal of a password policy in making brute force attacks more computationally intensive and time-consuming."
Compare the 'bitsize of password space' with the 'number of possible passwords' for a given character combination and length.,"The `'number of possible passwords'` for a given character combination and length is calculated as `c^n`, where `c` is the number of choices per character and `n` is the password length. This represents the total count of unique passwords that could be formed. The `'bitsize of password space'` is the base-2 logarithm of this number (`log2(c^n)`). It quantifies the entropy or the amount of information contained within the password space, indicating how many bits are required to uniquely identify each possible password. A higher bitsize signifies a stronger password space, making it more resistant to brute force attacks."
Compare the security implications of using the same passwords across different accounts versus using unique passwords for each account.,"Using the `same passwords across different accounts` creates a significant security vulnerability. If one account is compromised, an attacker can use that single password to gain unauthorized access to all other accounts where the same password has been reused. This amplifies the impact of a single breach. In contrast, using `unique passwords for each account` is a fundamental security best practice. If one account's password is compromised, the damage is contained to that single account, as the attacker cannot use the same credential to access other services, thereby limiting the overall risk and impact of a breach."
Compare the role of a hash function in password verification versus its role in an offline guessing attack.,"In `password verification`, a `hash function` is used by the verifier (system B) to transform the plain-text password provided by the claimant into a hash. This generated hash is then compared against a securely stored hash of the user's actual password to authenticate the user. The hash function ensures that the original password is never stored or directly compared. In an `offline guessing attack`, the attacker also uses a `hash function`. After obtaining stolen password hashes, the attacker guesses potential plain-text passwords, applies the same hash function to each guess, and then compares the resulting hash with the stolen hashes to find a match. In both scenarios, the hash function performs a one-way transformation, but its application differs in purpose: verification is defensive, while offline guessing is offensive."
