Provide a comprehensive summary of how password hashes are stored in different operating systems.,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a password file. In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"". In Unix systems, password hashes are traditionally stored in /etc/passwd, but in modern Unix/Linux systems, they are found in the shadow file, specifically at /etc/shadow."
Summarise the temporary storage locations for passwords at the application level.,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations. These locations include buffers, caches, or even a web page. It is important to note that passwords should not be saved in the cache. The management of these temporary storage locations is typically beyond the control of the user, which means a password might be retained for a longer duration than the user intends."
Can you summarise the key considerations regarding user control over password storage at the application level?,"A key consideration regarding user control over password storage at the application level is that the management of these temporary storage locations is normally beyond the user's control. This lack of control implies that a password may be kept in locations like buffers, caches, or web pages for a longer period than the user might expect or desire, potentially increasing exposure risks."
Where are password hashes stored in a Windows system?,"In a Windows system, password hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. The specific path for this file is ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM""."
Explain where password hashes are stored in modern Unix/Linux systems.,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are stored in the shadow file, located at /etc/shadow. Historically, in Unix, they were stored in /etc/passwd."
Describe the fundamental principle of hashed password verification.,"The fundamental principle of hashed password verification is that the verifier (system) does not store the actual passwords, only their hashes. When a claimant provides a password, the verifier computes the hash of the provided password and compares it to the stored hash associated with that claimant. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the password is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. A hash is a function that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size value, often used for data integrity and security."
Summarise the process a verifier uses to authenticate a user's password.,"When a claimant (Claimant A) attempts to authenticate with a password, the verifier (system B) receives the password. The verifier then applies a hash function (h) to the provided password to compute its hash. This newly computed hash is then compared against the h(password_A) value stored in the password table, which contains pre-computed hashes of legitimate passwords. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the authentication is successful, and the user is accepted. If there is no match, the authentication fails, and the user is rejected."
What is the role of a hash function in password verification?,"In password verification, a hash function (h) plays the crucial role of transforming a plaintext password into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. The verifier stores only these hashes, not the original passwords. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is fed into the same hash function, and the resulting hash is compared against the stored hash. This one-way process ensures that even if the stored hashes are compromised, the original passwords cannot be easily retrieved, enhancing security."
Why do verifiers store password hashes instead of plain text passwords?,"Verifiers store password hashes instead of plain text passwords as a security measure. This practice ensures that even if the password database is compromised, the actual passwords are not directly exposed. Instead, only the hashes (the output of a one-way mathematical function applied to the password) are revealed. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to obtain the original passwords, as reversing a hash function is computationally infeasible."
Summarise the main categories of attacks on passwords.,"The main categories of attacks on passwords include Offline Guessing Attacks and Phishing and Spoofing. Offline Guessing Attacks involve an attacker attempting to guess passwords without direct interaction with the authentication system, often by obtaining hashed passwords. Phishing and Spoofing attacks involve tricking users into revealing their credentials, typically through deceptive communications or fake websites."
What are the sub-types of Offline Guessing Attacks?,"The sub-types of Offline Guessing Attacks are Exhaustive attacks and Intelligent attacks. Exhaustive attacks, also known as brute-force attacks, involve trying every possible password combination. Intelligent attacks, such as Dictionary attacks, use pre-compiled lists of common passwords, phrases, or variations to guess passwords more efficiently."
Define an Offline Guessing Attack and explain its mechanism.,"An Offline Guessing Attack is an attack where the attacker first obtains the hashed passwords from a system. Once these hashes are acquired, the attacker then attempts to guess the original passwords by generating potential passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the stolen hashes. This process occurs 'offline,' meaning the attacker does not interact directly with the live authentication system during the guessing phase."
Explain why Offline Guessing Attacks are considered a plausible threat.,"Offline Guessing Attacks are considered a plausible threat due to several factors. Firstly, there are many incidents of stolen (hashed) passwords resulting from hacks on servers or sniffing traffic. Secondly, users often reuse the same passwords across different accounts. This means that if a password for one account is compromised through an offline guessing attack, it can affect other accounts belonging to the same user, amplifying the impact of the breach."
What are the consequences of users reusing the same passwords across different accounts in the context of offline guessing attacks?,"In the context of offline guessing attacks, the consequence of users reusing the same passwords across different accounts is that the compromise of a password for one account can directly affect other accounts. If an attacker successfully guesses a hashed password for one service, they can then use that same password to gain unauthorized access to other services where the user has reused it, significantly broadening the scope of the breach."
"Summarise the storage location of password hashes in Unix/Linux systems, as it relates to offline guessing attacks.","In Unix systems, password hashes are historically stored in /etc/passwd. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, these hashes are stored in the shadow file, specifically located at /etc/shadow. This separation of hashes into a less accessible file (/etc/shadow) from the user information file (/etc/passwd) is a security measure, but if an attacker obtains this shadow file, they can then perform offline guessing attacks."
Summarise the key findings regarding the causes of the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The SingHealth cyber attack was primarily a result of human lapses by employees and IT system weaknesses. The report indicated that the breach into the public healthcare group's database was preventable, despite the attacker's skill. Key vulnerabilities included the SCM database operating on an open network linked to Citrix servers, a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access to the SCM database, inadequately secured Citrix servers where 2-factor authentication (2FA) was not enforced for administrator access, and the presence of weak administrator account passwords."
What specific IT system weaknesses contributed to the SingHealth cyber attack?,"Several specific IT system weaknesses contributed to the SingHealth cyber attack. These included: the SCM database functioning on an open network that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access (with no control to detect or block bulk queries), Citrix servers not adequately secured against unauthorized access (specifically, 2-factor authentication (2FA) was not enforced for administrator login), and the presence of weak administrator account passwords."
Explain the role of weak administrator account passwords in the SingHealth cyber attack.,"Weak administrator account passwords were identified as a significant vulnerability that may have been exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack. This weakness was among others discovered during a test but the remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leading to these vulnerabilities, including weak passwords, remaining at the time of the cyber attack. Weak passwords are those that are easy to guess or crack, often lacking complexity, length, or a mix of character types."
How did the lack of 2-factor authentication enforcement contribute to the SingHealth breach?,"The lack of 2-factor authentication (2FA) enforcement for administrator access was a critical vulnerability in the SingHealth breach. The process requiring 2FA was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in as an administrator. This allowed the attacker to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA, bypassing an important security layer that would typically require a second form of verification beyond just a password."
Describe the issues related to the SCM database and Citrix servers in the SingHealth incident.,"In the SingHealth incident, the SCM database was a critical point of vulnerability. It functioned on an open network and was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), creating an exploitable pathway. Furthermore, there was a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access to the SCM database, meaning bulk queries could be made undetected. The Citrix servers themselves were not adequately secured, notably lacking enforced 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access, which allowed attackers to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access."
Summarise the details of the Adobe data breach.,"The Adobe data breach impacted at least 38 million users. This incident exposed user account information and prompted a flurry of password reset emails. Additionally, the breach appeared to involve a massive source code leak that broadened to include Adobe's Photoshop family of graphical design products."
What information was leaked in the LinkedIn password incident?,"In the LinkedIn password incident, more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. While some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords as a precautionary measure."
Describe the scale of the Russia gang hack related to usernames and passwords.,"The Russia gang hack was of a massive scale, resulting in the compromise of 1.2 billion usernames and passwords. This incident highlights the extensive reach and impact of organized cybercrime on user credentials."
What was the vulnerability discovered in the Starbucks mobile app regarding user information?,"A vulnerability was discovered in the Starbucks mobile app that put coffee drinkers' information at risk. Specifically, the app was found to be storing user information and passwords in clear text. This means sensitive data like usernames, email addresses, and passwords were not encrypted, making them easily readable if accessed by an attacker."
Summarise the incident involving passwords posted to Pastebin.,"An incident involving passwords posted to Pastebin.com revealed that more than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted on the clipboard website in the year 2013. This was identified through an analysis by a Swiss security firm, underscoring the risk of public exposure of stolen credentials."
What was the advice given to LinkedIn users after their passwords were leaked?,"After more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked to the Web, all users were advised to change their passwords. This recommendation was made despite some login details being encrypted, emphasizing the importance of proactive security measures following a data breach."
What type of data was exposed in the Adobe breach beyond user account information?,"Beyond user account information, the Adobe breach also involved a massive source code leak. This leak broadened to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products, indicating a significant compromise of intellectual property in addition to user data."
"Why is storing passwords in clear text, as seen in the Starbucks app vulnerability, a significant security risk?","Storing passwords in clear text is a significant security risk because it means the passwords are not encrypted and are directly readable. If an attacker gains access to the system or database where these passwords are stored, they can immediately obtain the plaintext passwords, along with associated usernames and email addresses, without needing to perform any cracking or decryption. This makes the compromised data instantly usable for malicious purposes."
Define a Brute Force Attack in the context of passwords.,"A Brute Force Attack against passwords is a guessing attack where an attacker attempts to discover a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. For each generated password, its hash is computed and then checked against the target hashes (stolen or known hashes). The goal is to find a match, thereby revealing the original password."
What measures can be taken to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"A primary measure against a brute force attack is to increase the space of possible passwords. This can be achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs. A robust password policy is an important means to implement these measures and increase the difficulties for brute force attacks."
How does increasing the space of possible passwords help against brute force attacks?,"Increasing the space of possible passwords helps against brute force attacks by making it computationally more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all potential password combinations. This is achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a wider variety of characters (alphabets, numerals, signs). A larger password space means there are exponentially more possible passwords, thus significantly increasing the time required for an attacker to guess the correct one, even with powerful cracking tools."
What is the importance of a strong password policy in combating brute force attacks?,"A strong password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of brute force attacks. Such a policy typically mandates requirements like minimum password length, inclusion of various character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and disallowing common or easily guessable patterns. By enforcing these rules, a password policy effectively increases the space of possible passwords, making it much harder and more time-consuming for attackers to guess passwords through exhaustive enumeration."
Explain the mechanism by which a brute force attack attempts to guess passwords.,"The mechanism of a brute force attack involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. The attacker generates a potential password, computes its hash, and then compares this computed hash against a known or stolen target hash. This process is repeated sequentially for all possible password combinations until a match is identified, thereby revealing the original password."
"Explain what password entropy, measured by 2^k, represents.","Password entropy, measured by 2^k, represents the bitsize of the password space for various character combinations. Here, n is the number of characters in the password, and c is the number of choices per character (i.e., the size of the character set used). The total number of possible passwords is c^n. The table provides the base-2 logarithm of this number, k, which indicates the effective number of bits of entropy. A higher k value signifies a larger and more secure password space, making it harder to guess."
How does the number of character choices and password length affect password entropy?,"The number of character choices (c) and password length (n) significantly affect password entropy. The total number of possible passwords is c^n. As n (password length) increases, the number of possible passwords grows exponentially, leading to a higher bitsize of password space (k). Similarly, as c (the number of unique characters available, e.g., lowercase, alphanumeric, mixed case alphanumeric, keyboard characters) increases, the password space also expands, further increasing entropy. Therefore, longer passwords using a wider variety of characters result in higher entropy and are more resistant to guessing attacks."
What is the cracking speed of current software password crackers?,"At present, software password crackers are capable of cracking passwords at a rate of up to 16 million passwords per second per PC. This high cracking speed underscores the importance of strong password policies and high password entropy to resist brute-force attacks."
"Based on the provided table, what is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password?","Based on the provided table (Table 10.1), for a 7-character password (n=7) using lowercase alphanumeric characters (c=36), the bitsize of password space is 36.2."
"Based on the provided table, what is the bitsize of password space for a 9-character password using all keyboard characters?","Based on the provided table (Table 10.1), for a 9-character password (n=9) using all keyboard characters (c=95), the bitsize of password space is 59.1."
"Based on the provided table, how does increasing password length from 5 to 10 characters impact the bitsize of password space for mixed case alphanumeric passwords?","Based on the provided table (Table 10.1), for mixed case alphanumeric passwords (c=62), increasing the password length from 5 characters (n=5) to 10 characters (n=10) significantly increases the bitsize of password space. For 5 characters, the bitsize is 29.8. For 10 characters, it increases to 59.5. This demonstrates that doubling the password length roughly doubles the bitsize of the password space, making it exponentially harder to crack."
What is the significance of the 'c' and 'n' variables in calculating password entropy?,"In calculating password entropy, c represents the number of choices per character, which is the size of the character set available for creating the password (e.g., 26 for lowercase, 62 for mixed case alphanumeric, 95 for keyboard characters). n represents the number of characters in the password, or its length. The total number of possible passwords is c^n, and the bitsize of password space (k) is the base-2 logarithm of this value. Both c and n are critical because they directly determine the size of the password space, with larger values leading to higher entropy and stronger passwords."
Summarise the overall importance of password security based on the provided information.,"Password security is of paramount importance due to the widespread storage of password hashes in operating systems, the temporary holding of passwords in application-level locations, and the constant threat of various attacks. Verifiers store hashes, not actual passwords, highlighting the need for strong hashing. However, offline guessing attacks, phishing, and spoofing remain significant threats, often exploiting weak passwords or system vulnerabilities. High-profile incidents like SingHealth, Adobe, LinkedIn, and Starbucks demonstrate the severe consequences of poor password practices and system weaknesses. Implementing strong password policies that increase password entropy (longer, more complex passwords) is crucial to counter brute force attacks and protect user data from sophisticated password crackers."
What are the primary risks associated with temporary password storage at the application level?,"The primary risks associated with temporary password storage at the application level, such as in buffers, caches, or web pages, stem from the fact that the management of these locations is normally beyond the control of the user. This means a password may be kept longer than the user intends, increasing its exposure window. If an attacker gains access to the system or device, these temporarily stored plaintext passwords could be compromised, even if the system's primary password storage is secure."
Compare and contrast the storage of password hashes in Windows versus Unix/Linux systems.,"In Windows systems, password hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"". In contrast, Unix systems traditionally stored password hashes in /etc/passwd. However, modern Unix/Linux systems have evolved to store these hashes in a more secure location, specifically the shadow file at /etc/shadow. The key difference is the specific file and directory path, with modern Unix/Linux systems separating the hash storage into a dedicated, typically more restricted, file."
What is the primary difference between an exhaustive attack and a dictionary attack?,"The primary difference between an exhaustive attack and a dictionary attack lies in their approach to guessing passwords. An exhaustive attack, also known as a brute-force attack, systematically tries every single possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. A dictionary attack, which is a type of intelligent attack, uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously compromised passwords (a 'dictionary') to attempt to guess the password, making it more efficient for common or weak passwords but less comprehensive than an exhaustive attack."
How can server hacks or sniffing traffic lead to offline guessing attacks?,"Server hacks or sniffing traffic can lead to offline guessing attacks by providing attackers with access to hashed passwords. When a server is hacked, attackers may gain unauthorized access to the password file (e.g., /etc/shadow in Linux or the SAM file in Windows) containing these hashes. Similarly, sniffing traffic involves intercepting network communications, which, in some cases, might expose hashed passwords if they are transmitted insecurely or if the attacker can capture enough data to reconstruct them. Once these hashes are obtained, the attacker can then perform offline guessing attempts without needing to interact with the live system."
"What is the general advice for users following a password leak incident, such as the LinkedIn breach?","The general advice for users following a password leak incident, such as the LinkedIn breach, is to change their passwords immediately. This recommendation applies even if some login details were reported as encrypted, as a precautionary measure. Changing passwords helps mitigate the risk of attackers using the leaked credentials to access other accounts, especially if users have reused the same password across multiple services."
"Why is it critical for administrators to use strong passwords and enforce 2FA, as highlighted by the SingHealth incident?","It is critical for administrators to use strong passwords and enforce 2-factor authentication (2FA) because, as highlighted by the SingHealth incident, weak administrator account passwords and the lack of enforced 2FA were key vulnerabilities exploited by attackers. Administrators often have privileged access to sensitive systems and data. If their credentials are compromised, attackers can gain extensive control, bypass security measures, and cause significant damage. Strong passwords make guessing harder, and 2FA adds an essential second layer of security, making it much more difficult for unauthorized individuals to log in even if they obtain a password."
What is the primary objective of an attacker performing an offline guessing attack?,"The primary objective of an attacker performing an offline guessing attack is to obtain the original plaintext passwords. They achieve this by first acquiring hashed passwords from a compromised system or intercepted traffic. Then, they systematically generate potential passwords, hash them, and compare these generated hashes against the stolen ones. A match reveals the original password, which can then be used for unauthorized access to accounts."
How does the concept of 'bitsize of password space' relate to password strength?,"The bitsize of password space, denoted as k (where the total number of possible passwords is 2^k), directly relates to password strength. A higher bitsize indicates a larger number of possible password combinations, making it exponentially more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker to guess the password through brute force attacks. Therefore, passwords with a higher bitsize of password space are considered stronger and more resistant to cracking."
What are the implications of software password crackers being able to process 16 million passwords per second?,"The implications of software password crackers being able to process 16 million passwords per second per PC are significant for password security. This high cracking speed means that weak passwords with low password entropy can be compromised very quickly. It underscores the urgent need for users and systems to implement strong password policies that mandate longer, more complex passwords with a greater variety of characters. Without such measures, even moderately complex passwords can be cracked in a relatively short amount of time, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches."
