Analyze the general methods for password storage in operating systems.,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a password file. At the application levels, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or a web page. The management of these temporary storage locations is typically beyond the control of the user, which can result in a password being retained for a longer duration than intended."
Describe where passwords are stored in a Windows system.,"In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. This file is located at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"".\n\nDefinition: A **Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file** is a database file in Windows operating systems that stores user account information, including hashed passwords."
Explain the evolution of password storage locations in Unix and modern Unix/Linux systems.,"In traditional Unix systems, passwords were stored in /etc/passwd. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file, located at /etc/shadow.\n\nDefinition: **/etc/passwd** is a plain text file that contains a list of the user accounts on a system, along with basic user information. **/etc/shadow** is a file that stores actual password hashes and other security-related information for user accounts, separated from the /etc/passwd file for enhanced security."
What are the risks associated with application-level temporary password storage?,"At the application levels, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations like buffers, caches, or a web page. A significant risk is that the management of these storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user, meaning a password could be kept longer than the user intended, increasing its exposure.\n\nDefinition: **Buffers** are temporary data storage areas. **Caches** are hardware or software components that store data so future requests for that data can be served faster."
Describe the process of hashed password verification as performed by a verifier system.,"During hashed password verification, a `Claimant A` sends a password to a `Verifier (system) B`. The verifier does not store the actual password, only its hash. The verifier takes the received password, applies a hash function (`h`) to it to generate `h(password)`. This newly generated hash is then compared against the stored hash (`h(password_A)`) in the verifier's password table. If the two hashes match, the system `ACCEPTS` the password; otherwise, it `REJECTS` it.\n\nDefinition: A **hash function** (`h`) is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (e.g., a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is the hash value. This process is typically one-way, meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the hash to get the original input."
Explain the principle behind how a verifier system handles passwords to enhance security.,"The fundamental principle for a verifier system in handling passwords to enhance security is that it does not store the actual passwords themselves, but only their hashes. When a user provides a password, the verifier computes its hash and compares it to the stored hash. This prevents the exposure of plain-text passwords even if the password database is compromised, as only the hashes would be accessible.\n\nDefinition: A **verifier system** is a component or process responsible for authenticating a user by checking their provided credentials against stored information."
Categorize the main types of attacks on passwords.,"Attacks on passwords can be categorized into two main types: Offline Guessing Attacks and ""Phishing"" and Spoofing.\n\nDefinition: **Offline Guessing Attacks** involve an attacker obtaining hashed passwords and attempting to guess the original passwords without direct interaction with the authentication system. **""Phishing"" and Spoofing** are social engineering attacks where attackers attempt to trick users into revealing their credentials, often by impersonating a legitimate entity or website."
Provide a detailed explanation of an Offline Guessing Attack on passwords.,"An Offline Guessing Attack is a type of attack where the attacker first obtains the hashed passwords from a system. Subsequently, the attacker attempts to guess the original plain-text passwords by applying a hash function to various plain-text guesses and comparing the resulting hashes with the stolen hashed passwords. This process is performed 'offline,' meaning the attacker does not interact with the live authentication system during the guessing phase.\n\nDefinition: **Hashed passwords** are the output of a hash function applied to a plain-text password, representing the password in a non-reversible, fixed-length string."
Why are Offline Guessing Attacks considered a plausible threat?,"Offline Guessing Attacks are considered a plausible threat due to several factors. These include many incidents of stolen (hashed) passwords resulting from hacks on servers or sniffing network traffic. Furthermore, the common practice of users employing the same passwords across different accounts means that the compromise of a password for one account can subsequently affect other accounts, making these attacks more impactful.\n\nDefinition: **Sniffing traffic** refers to the act of intercepting and logging network traffic passing over a digital communication medium, often to capture sensitive information like passwords."
Define 'Exhaustive attacks' in the context of password attacks.,"Exhaustive attacks, also known as brute-force attacks, are a type of offline guessing attack where the attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters for a password until the correct one is found. This involves enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence and checking if they match the target hashes.\n\nDefinition: A **brute-force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs)."
Explain 'Intelligent attacks' with a specific example.,"Intelligent attacks are a type of offline guessing attack that uses more refined methods than simply trying every combination. A common example is a Dictionary attack, where the attacker attempts to guess passwords by trying words from a dictionary, common phrases, or lists of previously leaked passwords. This method is often more efficient than exhaustive attacks because many users choose easily guessable passwords.\n\nDefinition: A **Dictionary attack** is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in an exhaustive list (dictionary) as a password."
What is the nature of 'Phishing' and Spoofing attacks in the context of password security?,"""Phishing"" and Spoofing are social engineering attacks aimed at tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as passwords. Phishing typically involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, while spoofing involves an attacker disguising themselves as a legitimate user or device to gain unauthorized access.\n\nDefinition: **Social engineering** is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information."
Analyze the primary factors that contributed to the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The SingHealth cyber attack was a result of human lapses and IT system weaknesses. Key contributing factors included the SCM database functioning on an open network linked to Citrix servers, creating a critical vulnerability. Additionally, there was a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access on the SCM database, and the Citrix servers were not adequately secured, notably by not enforcing 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access.\n\nDefinition: **SCM database** refers to the Supply Chain Management database, which in this context held sensitive information. **2-factor authentication (2FA)** is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity."
Detail the vulnerabilities identified in the SCM database during the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The SCM database, legally owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH). This configuration resulted in a critical vulnerability that the attacker exploited. Furthermore, there was a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access to the SCM database, with no existing controls to detect or block bulk queries."
Describe the weaknesses found in the Citrix servers that facilitated the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The Citrix servers of SGH were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Specifically, 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in. This allowed the attacker to access the server through alternative routes that did not require 2FA. Moreover, these servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues."
What specific password-related weakness was exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"A specific password-related weakness exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack included weak administrator account passwords. This vulnerability was identified during a test, but the subsequent remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leaving these vulnerabilities unaddressed at the time of the attack.\n\nDefinition: **Weak administrator account passwords** are passwords that are easily guessable or crackable, often due to being short, simple, or commonly used, making them a significant security vulnerability."
Summarize the impact of the Adobe data breach.,"The Adobe data breach impacted at least 38 million users, exposing user account information and prompting a flurry of password reset emails. The incident also involved a massive source code leak that broadened to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products."
Provide details about the LinkedIn password leak incident.,"In the LinkedIn password leak incident, more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. Although some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords as a precautionary measure."
What was the scale of credential posting on Pastebin in 2013?,"According to a recent analysis, more than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted on the clipboard website Pastebin.com in the year 2013 alone.\n\nDefinition: **Pastebin.com** is a website where users can store plain text, often used by developers to share code snippets or by attackers to post stolen data."
Describe the vulnerability found in the Starbucks mobile app regarding user information.,"A vulnerability in the Starbucks' mobile app put coffee drinkers' information at risk by storing user information, including usernames, email addresses, and passwords, in clear text. This meant that sensitive data was not encrypted and could be easily accessed if the system was compromised.\n\nDefinition: **Clear text** refers to data that is unencrypted and readable by humans or machines without any special decryption."
Define a brute force attack against passwords.,A brute force guessing attack against passwords is an attack that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks whether each generated hash matches the target hashes obtained from the compromised system.
What measures can be taken to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"A key measure against a brute force attack is to increase the space of possible passwords. This can be achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs, to be used in password creation. A strong password policy is an important means to increase these difficulties."
Explain the importance of a password policy in mitigating brute force attacks.,"A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing rules such as minimum length, complexity requirements (e.g., requiring a mix of alphabets, numerals, and signs), and disallowing common patterns, a password policy significantly expands the 'space' of possible passwords, making it much harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to guess them through exhaustive enumeration."
"How is password entropy measured, and what does it represent?","Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where 'k' represents the bitsize of the password space. The bitsize is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords. For `n`-character passwords with `c` choices per character, the number of possible passwords is `c^n`. The higher the bitsize, the greater the entropy and thus the stronger the password.\n\nDefinition: **Password entropy** is a measure of the unpredictability of a password, indicating how difficult it is to guess or crack. A higher entropy means a more secure password."
Analyze how the character set (choices per character) affects password entropy based on the provided data.,"The character set significantly affects password entropy. For a given password length (`n`), increasing the number of choices per character (`c`) substantially increases the bitsize of the password space. For example, an 8-character password using only lowercase (26 choices) has a bitsize of 37.6, while an 8-character password using mixed case alphanumeric (62 choices) has a bitsize of 47.6, and one using keyboard characters (95 choices) has a bitsize of 52.6. This demonstrates that a wider character set leads to higher entropy and stronger passwords."
Analyze how password length affects password entropy based on the provided data.,"Password length (`n`) has a direct and significant impact on password entropy. For any given character set (`c` choices per character), increasing the password length linearly increases the bitsize of the password space. For instance, with lowercase alphanumeric characters (36 choices), a 5-character password has a bitsize of 25.9, while a 10-character password has a bitsize of 51.7. This shows that longer passwords inherently offer greater entropy and are more resistant to guessing attacks."
What is the typical speed of software password crackers?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc)."
Explain the calculation required to determine the time it would take to brute-force passwords given cracker speed and password space.,"To calculate the time it would take to brute-force passwords for each entry, one would need to determine the total number of possible passwords (the password space, `c^n`) and divide that by the cracking speed of the software password cracker (e.g., 16 million passwords per second per PC). The bitsize of the password space, `k`, where the number of possible passwords is `2^k`, can be used to represent the total number of combinations."
Why did modern Unix/Linux systems move password hashes from /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow?,"Modern Unix/Linux systems moved password hashes from /etc/passwd to the `shadow` file in /etc/shadow to enhance security. The /etc/passwd file traditionally contained user account information and was readable by all users, which made password hashes vulnerable if they were stored there. By moving hashes to /etc/shadow, which has restricted read permissions, the system prevents unauthorized users from accessing the hashed passwords, thus mitigating offline guessing attacks."
Discuss the extent of user control over temporary password storage at the application level.,"At the application levels, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations like buffers, caches, or a web page. The management of these storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user. This lack of control means that a password may be kept longer than the user has bargained for, potentially increasing its exposure to unauthorized access."
What are the security implications of using the same passwords across different accounts?,"Using the same passwords across different accounts has significant security implications. If an attacker compromises a password for one account, for example, through a server hack or sniffing traffic, that same password can then be used to gain unauthorized access to other accounts belonging to the same user. This means the compromise of a single password can affect multiple accounts, amplifying the impact of an attack."
Role of Hashing in Password Security,"Hashing plays a crucial role in securing passwords during the verification process by ensuring that the actual plain-text passwords are never stored by the verifier. Instead, only their irreversible hashes are stored. When a user attempts to log in, their provided password is hashed, and this hash is compared to the stored hash. This design protects against direct exposure of passwords even if the password database is breached, as attackers would only obtain hashes, not the original passwords."
Differentiate between Offline Guessing Attacks and 'Phishing' and Spoofing attacks.,"Offline Guessing Attacks involve an attacker obtaining hashed passwords and attempting to deduce the original passwords without direct interaction with the live authentication system. In contrast, ""Phishing"" and Spoofing attacks are social engineering tactics where attackers directly interact with users, typically by impersonating a trusted entity, to trick them into voluntarily revealing their passwords or other sensitive information."
Identify common vulnerabilities that lead to the theft of hashed passwords.,"Common vulnerabilities that lead to the theft of hashed passwords include successful hacks on servers, which can compromise password files, and sniffing network traffic, where passwords or their hashes might be intercepted during transmission. These incidents allow attackers to obtain the hashed passwords necessary for offline guessing attacks."
"Based on the SingHealth incident, what is the importance of real-time monitoring in IT security?","Based on the SingHealth incident, the lack of real-time monitoring for unusual queries and access on the SCM database and for vulnerabilities on Citrix servers was a critical weakness. This highlights the importance of real-time monitoring in IT security to detect and respond promptly to suspicious activities, block unauthorized bulk queries, and identify issues arising from servers, thereby preventing or mitigating cyber attacks."
"Why is the enforcement of 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access crucial, as demonstrated by the SingHealth incident?","The enforcement of 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access is crucial because it adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. As demonstrated by the SingHealth incident, where 2FA was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in for administrators, attackers were able to bypass this protection by accessing servers through other routes that did not require 2FA, leading to unauthorized access and data exfiltration."
"Discuss the consequences of weak administrator account passwords, referencing a specific incident.","Weak administrator account passwords pose a severe security risk, as demonstrated in the SingHealth cyber attack. Such passwords can be easily exploited by attackers, granting them unauthorized access to critical systems. In the SingHealth case, weak administrator passwords were a vulnerability that contributed to the attacker's success, even though they were discovered during a test, the remediation was mismanaged, leaving the system exposed."
What types of data were exposed in the Adobe breach?,"The Adobe breach exposed user account information and also involved a massive source code leak. This included information that prompted a flurry of password reset emails, indicating that password-related data was compromised, alongside the source code for products like the Photoshop family."
"What advice was given to users following the LinkedIn password leak, and why?","Following the LinkedIn password leak, all users were advised to change their passwords. This advice was given because, despite some login details being encrypted, the sheer volume of leaked passwords (over 6.4 million) presented a significant risk, and changing passwords was a necessary precautionary measure to protect user accounts from potential compromise."
"Explain the security risk associated with storing user passwords in clear text, using the Starbucks app as an example.","Storing user passwords in clear text, as was the vulnerability in the Starbucks mobile app, presents an extreme security risk. Clear text passwords are unencrypted and directly readable. If a system storing such data is compromised, attackers gain immediate access to users' actual passwords, email addresses, and usernames, without needing to crack hashes, making account takeover straightforward and highly probable."
How does a robust password policy directly impact the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"A robust password policy directly impacts the difficulty of a brute force attack by increasing the 'space of possible passwords.' By enforcing requirements for longer passwords and a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), the policy makes the total number of possible password combinations exponentially larger. This significantly extends the time and computational resources an attacker would need to enumerate all possibilities, thereby increasing the difficulty of a brute force attack."
"If a software password cracker can crack 16 million passwords per second, calculate the time to brute-force a password with a bitsize of 32.9.","A bitsize of 32.9 means there are `2^32.9` possible passwords. Given that a software password cracker can crack 16 million passwords per second, the time to brute-force such a password would be `(2^32.9) / (16 * 10^6)` seconds. This calculation determines the total number of combinations divided by the cracking speed to yield the time required.\n\nDefinition: **Bitsize of password space** refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of unique passwords possible given a certain length and character set."
"From a security perspective, why is it critical that a verifier does not store the actual passwords?","From a security perspective, it is critical that a verifier does not store the actual passwords, only their hashes, because this design protects against the catastrophic consequences of a data breach. If a verifier's database is compromised, attackers would only obtain hashed passwords, which are computationally difficult to reverse into plain text. If actual passwords were stored, a breach would immediately expose all user credentials, leading to widespread account compromises."
Analyze the impact of the SCM database functioning on an open network in the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The SCM database functioning on an open network that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) created a critical vulnerability in the SingHealth cyber attack. An open network inherently increases the attack surface, making the database more accessible to unauthorized entities. This configuration allowed the attacker to exploit this critical vulnerability, leading to the successful exfiltration of data."
What was the consequence of the mismanaged remediation process in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The consequence of the mismanaged and inadequate remediation process undertaken by IHiS in the SingHealth cyber attack was that a number of vulnerabilities, including weak administrator account passwords, remained unaddressed at the time of the cyber attack. This failure to properly fix identified weaknesses allowed the attacker to exploit existing vulnerabilities, contributing to the success of the breach."
What is the general purpose of a password file in operating systems?,"The general purpose of a password file in operating systems is to store password hashes. This centralized storage allows the operating system to securely manage and verify user authentication credentials without storing the actual plain-text passwords, thereby enhancing system security."
Explain the security improvement achieved by using /etc/shadow instead of /etc/passwd for password hashes in modern Unix/Linux systems.,"The security improvement achieved by using /etc/shadow instead of /etc/passwd for password hashes in modern Unix/Linux systems lies in access control. Historically, /etc/passwd was world-readable, meaning any user could view the hashed passwords, making them susceptible to offline guessing attacks. By moving hashes to /etc/shadow, which has restricted permissions, only privileged processes can access the hashes, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and offline cracking."
What does it mean that 'a password may be kept longer than the user has bargained for'?,"The phrase 'a password may be kept longer than the user has bargained for' refers to the situation where passwords are temporarily stored in intermediate locations like buffers, caches, or web pages at the application level. Since the management of these storage locations is normally beyond the user's control, the password might persist in memory or on disk for an extended period, even after the user believes it has been discarded, increasing the window of opportunity for an attacker to compromise it."
What was the significance of the source code leak in the Adobe breach?,"The significance of the source code leak in the Adobe breach was that it broadened to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products. The exposure of source code can provide attackers with valuable insights into the software's architecture, potential vulnerabilities, and proprietary algorithms, which could be exploited for future attacks or intellectual property theft."
"Based on the provided data, what general recommendation can be made regarding minimum password length for improved security?","Based on the provided data on password entropy, a general recommendation for improved security is to enforce a longer minimum password length. The table clearly shows that increasing the number of characters (`n`) significantly increases the bitsize of the password space for any given character set. For example, moving from a 5-character to a 10-character password roughly doubles the bitsize, making it exponentially harder to brute-force."
