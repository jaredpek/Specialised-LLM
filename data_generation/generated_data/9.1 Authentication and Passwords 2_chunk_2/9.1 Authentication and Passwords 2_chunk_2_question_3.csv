What is the primary method for storing password hashes in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are primarily stored in a dedicated password file. This file contains the hashed versions of user passwords, rather than the plain text passwords themselves, enhancing security."
How are passwords stored in a Windows system?,"In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. This file is typically located at `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`, where `%windir%` refers to the Windows installation directory."
Where are password hashes stored in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file, which is located at `/etc/shadow`. Historically, in Unix, they were stored in `/etc/passwd`, but the `shadow` file provides enhanced security by separating the hashed passwords from other user information."
What are some intermediate storage locations where passwords might be held temporarily at the application level?,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even within a web page. It is advised not to save passwords in the cache due to security risks."
What control does a user typically have over the management of intermediate password storage locations?,"The management of intermediate password storage locations, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, is normally beyond the direct control of the user. This lack of control means that a password might be retained in these locations for a longer duration than the user intends or expects, posing a potential security risk."
What is the fundamental principle a verifier should follow regarding password storage during verification?,"The fundamental principle a verifier (system) should follow during password verification is that it does not store the actual passwords themselves, but only their hashes. This means that even if the verifier's password table is compromised, the original passwords are not directly exposed."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a claimant (user) providing a password, `password_A`, to a verifier (system) B. The verifier then applies a hash function, `h`, to the provided password to generate `h(password)`. This newly generated hash is then compared against the stored hash, `h(password_A)`, in the verifier's password table. If the two hashes match, the claimant is accepted; otherwise, the request is rejected. The verifier only stores the hashes, not the original passwords."
What is the role of a hash function in hashed password verification?,"In hashed password verification, a hash function (`h`) plays a crucial role by transforming the plain text password provided by the claimant into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. This hash is then compared against a pre-stored hash value. The hash function ensures that the original password is never stored or transmitted in plain text, enhancing security."
What is a verifier in the context of hashed password verification?,"In the context of hashed password verification, a verifier (system) B is the entity responsible for authenticating a claimant (user) A. The verifier receives a password from the claimant, hashes it, and compares the resulting hash against a stored hash in its password table to determine whether to accept or reject the claimant."
What are the two main categories of attacks on passwords?,"The two main categories of attacks on passwords are ""Offline Guessing Attacks"" and ""Phishing"" and ""Spoofing"" attacks. Offline guessing attacks involve attempting to guess passwords from stolen hashes, while phishing and spoofing involve deceptive tactics to trick users into revealing their credentials."
What are the types of 'Offline Guessing Attacks'?,"Offline Guessing Attacks can be categorized into two main types: ""Exhaustive attacks"" and ""Intelligent attacks."" Exhaustive attacks, also known as brute-force attacks, try every possible password combination. Intelligent attacks, such as Dictionary attacks, use pre-compiled lists of common passwords or phrases to guess credentials more efficiently."
What is an 'Offline Guessing Attack'?,"An Offline Guessing Attack is a type of password attack where an attacker first obtains the hashed passwords, typically from a compromised system or database. Subsequently, the attacker attempts to guess the original plain text passwords by hashing various guesses and comparing them against the stolen hashes, all performed offline without direct interaction with the target system."
Why is an Offline Guessing Attack considered a plausible threat?,"An Offline Guessing Attack is considered a plausible threat due to several factors: many incidents involve stolen (hashed) passwords resulting from server hacks or sniffing network traffic, and the widespread usage of the same passwords across different accounts means that the compromise of a password for one account can affect other accounts, making the attack more impactful."
How does an attacker typically obtain hashed passwords for an Offline Guessing Attack?,"An attacker typically obtains hashed passwords for an Offline Guessing Attack as a consequence of hacks on servers or by sniffing network traffic. Once these hashed passwords are acquired, the attacker can then attempt to guess the original passwords without needing to interact with the live system."
What are the consequences of users reusing the same passwords across different accounts in the context of an Offline Guessing Attack?,"When users reuse the same passwords across different accounts, it significantly amplifies the impact of an Offline Guessing Attack. If an attacker compromises a password for one account, they can then use that same password to attempt access to other accounts belonging to the same user, leading to a broader compromise of personal data and services."
What was the primary cause of the SingHealth cyber attack according to the COI report?,"The SingHealth cyber attack was primarily a result of human lapses by employees and vulnerabilities within the IT system. These weaknesses ultimately allowed the attacker to breach the public healthcare group's database, despite the attacker being skilled, indicating the attack was preventable."
What critical vulnerability related to the SCM database was exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"A critical vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack was that the SCM database, owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network. This network was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which provided an exploitable pathway for the attacker."
What weaknesses were identified in the monitoring of the SCM database during the SingHealth attack?,"During the SingHealth attack, it was found that there was a lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access. Specifically, there was no existing control to detect or block bulk queries to the database, and the Citrix servers of SGH were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities or issues."
How was administrator access to Citrix servers compromised in the SingHealth attack?,"Administrator access to Citrix servers in the SingHealth attack was compromised because the servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Crucially, the process requiring 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator login was not enforced as the exclusive means, allowing the attacker to access the server through alternative routes that did not require 2FA."
What role did weak administrator account passwords play in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"Weak administrator account passwords were identified as another significant weakness that may have been exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack. These weak passwords were among other vulnerabilities discovered during a test, but the remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leaving these vulnerabilities unaddressed at the time of the attack."
What is 2-factor authentication (2FA) in the context of system security?,"In the context of system security, 2-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires two distinct forms of identification to verify a user's identity. Its absence or non-enforcement, as seen in the SingHealth incident for administrator access, allows attackers to bypass a crucial layer of security and gain unauthorized entry through other routes."
What was the impact of the Adobe data breach mentioned in the document?,"The Adobe data breach impacted at least 38 million users, exposing user account information and prompting a large number of password reset emails. The breach also revealed that the massive source code leak at Adobe was expanding to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products."
How many LinkedIn passwords were reported to have leaked online in a specific incident?,"In a specific incident, more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were reported to have leaked online after an apparent hack. Although some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords as a precautionary measure."
What was the nature of the Russia gang hack mentioned in the document?,The Russia gang hack involved the compromise of 1.2 billion usernames and passwords. This incident highlights the large scale at which cybercriminals can operate to obtain user credentials.
What information was posted to Pastebin in 2013 according to a Swiss security firm's analysis?,"According to an analysis by a Swiss security firm, more than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted to the clipboard website Pastebin.com in the year 2013 alone."
What vulnerability was discovered in the Starbucks mobile app regarding user information?,"A vulnerability was discovered in the Starbucks mobile app that could put coffee drinkers' information at risk. This included their usernames, email addresses, and passwords, which were stored in clear text, making them easily accessible if the app or device was compromised."
What does it mean for passwords to be stored in 'clear text'?,"Storing passwords in 'clear text' means that they are saved in an unencrypted, human-readable format. This is a significant security vulnerability because if an attacker gains access to the storage location, they can immediately read and use the passwords without needing to decrypt them, as demonstrated by the Starbucks app incident."
What is a Brute Force Attack against passwords?,"A Brute Force Attack against passwords is a guessing attack that attempts to discover a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. For each generated password, its hash is computed and then checked against the target hashes to see if a match is found."
How can the difficulty of a Brute Force Attack be increased?,"The difficulty of a Brute Force Attack can be increased by expanding the space of possible passwords. This is achieved by using longer passwords and allowing for a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs, which makes the number of combinations exponentially larger."
What is the role of a password policy in mitigating brute force attacks?,"A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing rules for password creation, such as minimum length, inclusion of different character types (alphabets, numerals, signs), and complexity requirements, a password policy significantly expands the search space for attackers, making brute-forcing computationally more intensive and time-consuming."
What factors determine the bitsize of password space for various character combinations?,"The bitsize of password space for various character combinations is determined by two main factors: 'n', which represents the number of characters (length) in the password, and 'c', which represents the number of choices per character (the size of the character set, e.g., lowercase, alphanumeric, mixed case alphanumeric, or keyboard characters). The bitsize is calculated as the base-2 logarithm of c^n."
What is the current cracking speed of software password crackers mentioned in the document?,"At present, software password crackers are capable of cracking up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc). This high cracking speed underscores the importance of strong passwords and robust password policies to resist brute-force attacks."
What does 'c' represent in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'c' represents the number of choices per character, which is essentially the size of the character set available for creating the password. For example, 'c' could be 26 for lowercase alphabets, 36 for lowercase alphanumeric characters, 62 for mixed case alphanumeric characters, or 95 for keyboard characters."
What does 'n' represent in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'n' represents the number of characters in the password, which is essentially the password's length. A longer password (higher 'n') significantly increases the bitsize of the password space, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password using only lowercase alphabetic characters?,"For a 5-character password using only lowercase alphabetic characters (c=26), the bitsize of the password space is 23.5. This value represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 10-character password using all keyboard characters?,"For a 10-character password using all keyboard characters (c=95), the bitsize of the password space is 65.7. This indicates a significantly larger number of possible combinations compared to passwords with fewer characters or a smaller character set, making it much harder to brute-force."
What is the bitsize of password space for an 8-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For an 8-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters (c=62), the bitsize of the password space is 47.6. This value reflects the increased complexity and number of possible combinations when both uppercase and lowercase letters, along with numbers, are allowed."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters?,"For a 7-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters (c=36), the bitsize of the password space is 36.2. This indicates the logarithmic measure of the total possible password combinations for such a configuration."
What is the significance of increasing the space of possible passwords?,"Increasing the space of possible passwords, by using longer passwords and a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), is significant because it directly increases the difficulty and time required for a brute force attack. A larger password space means an attacker has to try exponentially more combinations to guess the correct password, making the attack impractical or impossible within a reasonable timeframe."
What is the difference between an exhaustive attack and a dictionary attack?,"An exhaustive attack, also known as a brute-force attack, attempts to guess a password by systematically trying every single possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. In contrast, a dictionary attack is an intelligent attack that tries to guess a password by using a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords, which is generally faster but less comprehensive than an exhaustive attack."
What is a password file in the context of operating systems?,"A password file in the context of operating systems is a dedicated file where password hashes are stored. This file serves as a secure repository for user authentication data, ensuring that plain text passwords are not directly accessible, even if the file itself is compromised."
What is the purpose of storing password hashes instead of plain text passwords?,"The purpose of storing password hashes instead of plain text passwords is to enhance security. If a system's password file is compromised, attackers only gain access to the hashed versions of passwords, not the original plain text passwords. This makes it significantly harder for them to use the stolen credentials, as they would still need to reverse the hashing process or perform an offline guessing attack."
What is the `SAM` file in Windows systems?,"The `SAM` (Security Accounts Manager) file in Windows systems is where passwords are stored. It is a critical database that holds user account information, including hashed passwords, and is typically located in the `%windir%\system32\config\` directory."
What is `/etc/passwd` in Unix systems?,"In traditional Unix systems, `/etc/passwd` is a file where password hashes were stored. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, for enhanced security, password hashes are now stored in the `/etc/shadow` file, while `/etc/passwd` primarily contains other user account information."
What is `/etc/shadow` in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, `/etc/shadow` is a critical file that stores password hashes. It is designed to enhance security by separating the hashed passwords from other user account details, which are typically found in `/etc/passwd`, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access password hashes."
What is a password table in the context of hashed password verification?,"A password table, in the context of hashed password verification, is a data structure maintained by the verifier (system) B. This table stores the hashed versions of user passwords, such as `h(password_A)` for claimant A, which are used for comparison against the hash of a password provided during a login attempt."
What is 'Phishing' and 'Spoofing' in the context of password attacks?,"'Phishing' and 'Spoofing' are types of password attacks that involve deceptive tactics. Phishing typically involves tricking users into revealing their credentials through fraudulent emails or websites that mimic legitimate entities. Spoofing involves an attacker impersonating a legitimate user, device, or network to gain unauthorized access to a system or to steal data."
What is the purpose of the `h` function in the hashed password verification diagram?,"The `h` function in the hashed password verification diagram represents a hash function. Its purpose is to take a plain text password as input and produce a fixed-size hash value. This hash value is then used for comparison with a stored hash to verify the password, ensuring that the actual password is never stored or directly exposed."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 6-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For a 6-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters (c=62), the bitsize of the password space is 35.7.
