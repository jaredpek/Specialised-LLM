Define the concept of password storage in operating systems.,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a password file. These files serve as a dedicated location for securely keeping the hashed representations of user passwords, rather than the plain-text passwords themselves."
Where are passwords stored in a Windows system?,"In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. The specific path for this file is typically `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`."
"Explain where password hashes are stored in Unix/Linux systems, distinguishing between older and modern approaches.","In Unix systems, password hashes were traditionally stored in `/etc/passwd`. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, for enhanced security, they are stored in the `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`."
Identify the temporary storage locations where passwords may be held at the application level.,"At the application levels, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations. These include buffers, which are temporary data storage areas; caches, which store data for faster access; or even on a web page. It is advised not to save passwords in the cache."
Discuss the user's control over temporary password storage locations at the application level.,"The management of temporary password storage locations at the application level, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, is normally beyond the control of the user. This lack of control means that a password may be kept longer than the user has intended or bargained for, potentially increasing exposure risks."
What is the primary principle a verifier should follow regarding password storage during hashed password verification?,"The primary principle a verifier should follow during hashed password verification is that it does (should) not store the actual passwords, only their hashes. This means that even if the verifier's system is compromised, the original passwords are not directly exposed."
Describe the overall process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a Claimant A providing a password, A, to a Verifier (system) B. The Verifier B then hashes the provided password using a hash function, `h`, to produce `h(password)`. This newly computed hash is then compared against the stored hash, `h(password_A)`, which is retrieved from the password table. If `h(password)` matches `h(password_A)`, the verification is successful, resulting in 'ACCEPT'; otherwise, it results in 'REJECT'."
What are the two main categories of attacks on passwords?,"The two main categories of attacks on passwords are Offline Guessing Attacks and ""Phishing"" and Spoofing."
List the types of Offline Guessing Attacks mentioned.,"The types of Offline Guessing Attacks mentioned are Exhaustive attacks and Intelligent attacks, which include Dictionary attacks."
Define an Offline Guessing Attack.,An Offline Guessing Attack is an attack where the attacker obtains the hashed passwords and then attempts to guess the original passwords by trying various combinations against the obtained hashes.
"Explain the steps involved in an Offline Guessing Attack, as depicted in the diagram.","In an Offline Guessing Attack, the process begins with a 'Plain Text' password. This plain text is then passed through a 'Hash Function' to produce a 'Hashed Text'. An attacker obtains these hashed passwords and then attempts to guess the original passwords by applying the hash function to various plain text guesses and comparing the resulting hashes to the stolen hashed texts."
Why is an Offline Guessing Attack considered a plausible threat?,"An Offline Guessing Attack is considered a plausible threat due to several factors: many incidents involve stolen (hashed) passwords as a consequence of hacks on servers or sniffing traffic, and the widespread usage of the same passwords across different accounts means that the compromise of a password for one account can affect other accounts."
What are the consequences of users employing the same passwords across multiple accounts in the context of security threats?,"When users employ the same passwords across different accounts, the consequence is that the compromise of a password for one account can affect other accounts. This significantly amplifies the impact of a successful attack, as an attacker gaining access to one hashed password can potentially gain access to multiple services or systems."
"According to the SingHealth cyber attack report, what were the primary causes of the breach?","According to the SingHealth cyber attack report, the primary causes of the breach were human lapses by employees and vulnerabilities with the IT system. These factors ultimately made the breach into the public healthcare group's database preventable, despite the attacker being skilled."
Identify a critical vulnerability exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack related to the SCM database.,"A critical vulnerability exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack was related to the SCM database. This database, owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which created the exploitable vulnerability."
What issues were found regarding the monitoring of the SCM database during the SingHealth cyber attack?,"During the SingHealth cyber attack, a lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access was found. Specifically, there was no existing control to detect or block bulk queries being made to the database, and the Citrix servers of SGH were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues."
How did the lack of 2-factor authentication (2FA) enforcement contribute to the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The lack of 2-factor authentication (2FA) enforcement contributed to the SingHealth cyber attack because the Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The process requiring 2FA for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in as an administrator, allowing the attacker to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA."
What role did weak administrator account passwords play in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"Weak administrator account passwords were identified as another weakness that may have been exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack. This issue was discovered during a test, but the remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leading to these vulnerabilities remaining at the time of the attack."
Summarize the impact of the Adobe data breach mentioned in the document.,"The Adobe data breach exposed user account information and prompted a flurry of password reset emails, impacting at least 38 million users. The breach also appeared to broaden to include the company's Photoshop family of graphical design products due to a massive source code leak."
"How many LinkedIn passwords were leaked online, according to the document?","More than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. While some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords."
What was the scale of the Russia gang hack mentioned in the document?,The Russia gang hack involved 1.2 billion usernames and passwords.
"How many credentials were posted to Pastebin in 2013, and what type of information did they include?","More than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted on the clipboard website Pastebin.com in the year 2013 alone, according to a recent analysis by a Swiss security firm."
What vulnerability was found in the Starbucks mobile app regarding user information?,"A vulnerability in Starbucks' mobile app could be putting coffee drinkers' information at risk. This information included their usernames, email addresses, and passwords, which were stored in clear text."
Define a Brute Force Attack against passwords.,"A Brute Force Attack against passwords is a guessing attack that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence, and then checking whether they match the target hashes."
How does a brute force guessing attack work in practice?,"In practice, a brute force guessing attack works by systematically trying every possible combination of characters for a password. For each combination, it computes the hash and compares it to the target hash. If a match is found, the original password has been successfully guessed."
What is a key measure against brute force attacks?,"A key measure against brute force attacks is to increase the space of possible passwords. This can be achieved by using longer passwords and allowing more varieties of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs, making it computationally more expensive for an attacker to enumerate all possibilities."
What role does password policy play in increasing the difficulty of brute force attacks?,"Password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of brute force attacks. By enforcing policies that require longer passwords and a mix of character types (alphabets, numerals, signs), it expands the 'space' of possible passwords, making it much harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to guess them."
"How is password entropy measured, according to the document?","Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where 'k' represents the bitsize of the password space. The bitsize of password space is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, given 'n' characters and 'c' choices per character, calculated as `log2(c^n)`."
What does the 'Table 10.1' in the document illustrate regarding password entropy?,"Table 10.1 illustrates the bitsize of password space for various character combinations. It shows how the number of 'n'-character passwords, given 'c' choices per character (where the number of possible passwords is `c^n`), translates into a base-2 logarithm of this number, effectively quantifying the password's entropy."
"Based on 'Table 10.1', what is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character password using 36 (lowercase alphanumeric) character choices?","Based on Table 10.1, for a 7-character password using 36 (lowercase alphanumeric) character choices, the bitsize of the password space is 36.2."
"Based on 'Table 10.1', what is the bitsize of password space for a 9-character password using 62 (mixed case alphanumeric) character choices?","Based on Table 10.1, for a 9-character password using 62 (mixed case alphanumeric) character choices, the bitsize of the password space is 53.6."
What is the current cracking speed of software password crackers per personal computer?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pswd/sec per pc)."
"If a password has a bitsize of 23.5 (from Table 10.1 for 5 lowercase characters) and software can crack 16 million passwords per second, how would one calculate the time to brute-force it?","To calculate the time to brute-force a password with a bitsize of 23.5, one would first determine the total number of possible passwords, which is 2^(23.5). Then, this total number of possible passwords would be divided by the cracking speed of 16 million passwords per second to find the total time in seconds. For example, `(2^23.5) / (16 * 10^6)` seconds."
What is the significance of the `shadow` file in modern Unix/Linux systems for password storage?,"The `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`, is significant in modern Unix/Linux systems because it stores password hashes, enhancing security by separating them from the publicly readable `/etc/passwd` file. This prevents unauthorized users from easily accessing hashed passwords, making offline guessing attacks more difficult."
Explain the concept of 'Claimant A' and 'Verifier (system) B' in the context of hashed password verification.,"'Claimant A' refers to the entity attempting to authenticate, typically a user providing a password. 'Verifier (system) B' refers to the system or application responsible for checking the provided password against stored credentials to confirm the claimant's identity, using password hashes."
What is `h(password)` in the hashed password verification process?,"`h(password)` represents the hash value generated by applying a specific hash function, denoted as `h`, to the password provided by the claimant. This computed hash is then compared against the stored hash to verify the password's authenticity."
What is the purpose of a password table in the hashed password verification system?,"The purpose of a password table in the hashed password verification system is to store the hashed versions of user passwords, such as `h(password_A)`. This table allows the verifier to retrieve the stored hash corresponding to a claimant's identifier (e.g., 'A') for comparison with the hash of the password provided during authentication."
How does 'Phishing' and Spoofing relate to attacks on passwords?,"'Phishing' and Spoofing are categories of attacks on passwords that typically involve deceptive tactics to trick users into revealing their credentials. Phishing often uses fake websites or emails to solicit personal data, while spoofing involves impersonating a legitimate entity to gain trust and access to information, including passwords."
What is an 'Exhaustive attack' in the context of offline guessing attacks?,"An 'Exhaustive attack,' also known as a brute-force attack, in the context of offline guessing attacks, involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method guarantees finding the password if enough time and computational resources are available."
What are 'Intelligent attacks' like 'Dictionary attacks' in password cracking?,"'Intelligent attacks,' such as 'Dictionary attacks,' are a type of offline guessing attack that uses pre-compiled lists of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords (dictionaries) to guess passwords. Instead of trying every possible combination, they focus on likely passwords, making them more efficient than exhaustive attacks for common passwords."
"Why is it important for the verifier not to store the actual passwords, but only their hashes?","It is important for the verifier not to store the actual passwords, but only their hashes, because this design significantly enhances security. If the verifier's system or password table is compromised, attackers will only obtain hashes, not the original plain-text passwords. This makes it much harder for attackers to use the stolen data directly, as they would still need to crack the hashes."
What does `%windir%` refer to in the Windows password storage path?,"`%windir%` in the Windows password storage path `(%windir%\system32\config\SAM)` is an environment variable that typically refers to the directory where the Windows operating system is installed, such as `C:\Windows`. It provides a dynamic way to locate system files regardless of the specific installation drive or directory name."
How does sniffing traffic contribute to the plausibility of offline guessing attacks?,"Sniffing traffic contributes to the plausibility of offline guessing attacks by allowing attackers to intercept data packets transmitted over a network. If passwords or their hashes are transmitted insecurely, an attacker can capture these, obtain the hashed passwords, and then attempt to crack them offline without directly interacting with the target system."
What is the meaning of 'c' and 'n' in the context of password space calculation (`c^n`)?,"In the context of password space calculation (`c^n`), 'c' represents the number of choices per character, which is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase alphabets, 95 for keyboard characters). 'n' represents the number of characters in the password, or the password length."
"Based on Table 10.1, how does increasing password length affect the bitsize of password space for lowercase alphanumeric characters?","Based on Table 10.1, increasing password length significantly increases the bitsize of password space for lowercase alphanumeric characters. For example, a 5-character password has a bitsize of 25.9, while a 10-character password has a bitsize of 51.7, demonstrating that longer passwords exponentially increase the complexity and resistance to brute-force attacks."
"Based on Table 10.1, how does using a mixed-case alphanumeric character set compare to a lowercase-only character set in terms of bitsize for a 6-character password?","Based on Table 10.1, for a 6-character password, using a mixed-case alphanumeric character set (62 choices) results in a bitsize of 35.7, which is significantly higher than using a lowercase-only character set (26 choices), which has a bitsize of 28.2. This indicates that incorporating mixed-case characters substantially increases password entropy."
What is the implication of Starbucks app storing user information and passwords in 'CLEAR TEXT'?,"The implication of the Starbucks app storing user information and passwords in 'CLEAR TEXT' is a severe security vulnerability. 'Clear text' means the data is unencrypted and readable, making it easily accessible to anyone who gains unauthorized access to the app's storage or network traffic. This directly puts coffee drinkers' usernames, email addresses, and passwords at risk."
What was a key finding regarding IHiS's remediation process after the SingHealth cyber attack?,"A key finding regarding IHiS's remediation process after the SingHealth cyber attack was that it was mismanaged and inadequate. Despite discovering weaknesses like weak administrator account passwords during a test, a number of vulnerabilities remained at the time of the cyber attack due to the insufficient remediation efforts."
"What is the general advice given to users when their login details are leaked online, even if some are encrypted?","The general advice given to users when their login details are leaked online, even if some are encrypted, is to change their passwords. This is a crucial step to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, as encryption can sometimes be broken, or other details might be exposed."
How does the concept of 'buffers' relate to temporary password storage at the application level?,"Buffers are temporary data storage areas in computer memory. In the context of password storage, passwords may be held temporarily in buffers at the application level during processing, for example, when being entered or transmitted. This temporary storage, if not properly managed, can expose passwords to risks beyond user control."
What is the role of 'caches' in temporarily holding passwords at the application level?,"Caches are high-speed data storage layers that store a subset of data, typically temporary, so that future requests for that data are served up faster. At the application level, passwords may be temporarily held in caches, such as browser caches or application-specific caches. The document explicitly advises, ""don't save passwords in cache!"" due to the security risks involved."
What is the risk associated with passwords being kept longer than a user has 'bargained for' in temporary storage locations?,"The risk associated with passwords being kept longer than a user has 'bargained for' in temporary storage locations (like buffers, caches, or web pages) is increased exposure. Since the management of these locations is often beyond user control, the password might persist in memory or on disk longer than intended, making it vulnerable to retrieval by malicious software or unauthorized access."
What is the primary difference in password hash storage between `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems?,"The primary difference in password hash storage between `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems is security. While `/etc/passwd` traditionally stored password hashes and was readable by all users, `/etc/shadow` stores password hashes in modern systems and is only accessible by the root user, significantly enhancing security by protecting the hashes from general user access."
What does the term 'sniffing traffic' refer to in the context of password security threats?,"'Sniffing traffic' refers to the act of intercepting and analyzing data packets that are transmitted over a computer network. In the context of password security threats, it means an attacker can capture network communications to potentially obtain sensitive information, including hashed passwords, if the traffic is not encrypted."
How does the 'bitsize of password space' relate to the strength of a password?,"The 'bitsize of password space' directly relates to the strength of a password by quantifying its entropy. A higher bitsize indicates a larger number of possible password combinations, making it exponentially more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker to guess or brute-force the password. Therefore, a larger bitsize implies a stronger password."
What is the implication of the Adobe breach impacting 38 million users?,"The implication of the Adobe breach impacting 38 million users is a massive scale of exposure for user account information and potentially passwords. This large number of affected individuals means a significant portion of Adobe's user base had their data compromised, necessitating widespread password resets and raising concerns about data security practices."
Why is it critical to avoid saving passwords in the cache?,"It is critical to avoid saving passwords in the cache because caches are temporary storage locations that can be less secure than dedicated password managers or encrypted storage. If a system or application cache is compromised, passwords stored in clear text or easily recoverable formats could be exposed to attackers, leading to unauthorized access."
What type of data was at risk for 'coffee drinkers' due to the Starbucks app vulnerability?,"Due to the Starbucks app vulnerability, the type of data at risk for 'coffee drinkers' included their usernames, email addresses, and passwords. This information was stored in clear text, making it highly vulnerable to exposure."
What is the significance of the 'Source: Menezes et al. Handbook of Applied Cryptography' mentioned in the document?,"The 'Source: Menezes et al. Handbook of Applied Cryptography' mentioned in the document indicates that the information presented, particularly regarding hashed password verification and password entropy, is derived from a reputable and authoritative academic source in the field of cryptography. This lends credibility and academic rigor to the concepts discussed."
How does the number of 'choices per character' ('c') impact password entropy?,"The number of 'choices per character' ('c') significantly impacts password entropy. A larger 'c' (e.g., using mixed-case alphanumeric and special characters instead of just lowercase letters) increases the total number of possible characters for each position in a password. This exponentially expands the password space (`c^n`), making the password much harder to guess or brute-force and thus increasing its entropy."
What is the relationship between 'n' (password length) and the bitsize of password space?,"The relationship between 'n' (password length) and the bitsize of password space is exponential. As 'n' increases, the bitsize of password space grows rapidly, meaning that longer passwords have a significantly larger number of possible combinations. This makes them much more resistant to brute-force attacks, as the computational effort required to crack them increases exponentially with length."
