Where are password hashes typically stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a dedicated password file."
Explain where passwords are stored in a Windows system.,"In a Windows system, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. The typical path for this file is `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`."
Describe the storage location for password hashes in Unix and modern Unix/Linux systems.,"In Unix systems, password hashes are traditionally stored in `/etc/passwd`. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, they are stored in the `shadow` file, located at `/etc/shadow`."
What are some intermediate storage locations where passwords might be held at the application level?,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even on a web page. It is advised not to save passwords in the cache."
What is the user's control over temporary password storage locations at the application level?,"The management of these temporary storage locations, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, is normally beyond the control of the user. This means a password may be kept longer than the user might expect or desire."
What is the fundamental principle regarding password storage by a verifier in a hashed password verification system?,"The fundamental principle is that the verifier does not store the actual passwords themselves, but only their hashes. A password hash is a fixed-size string of characters generated from a password using a cryptographic hash function, making it computationally infeasible to reverse engineer the original password from the hash."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"In hashed password verification, a claimant (Claimant A) provides a password (password A) to a verifier (system B). The verifier then applies a hash function (h) to the provided password to generate its hash (h(password)). This newly computed hash is then compared against a stored hash (h(password A)) in the verifier's password table. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the verification is successful, and the claimant is accepted. If they do not match, the claimant is rejected."
What are the two main categories of attacks on passwords?,"The two main categories of attacks on passwords are Offline Guessing Attacks and ""Phishing"" and Spoofing."
What types of attacks fall under Offline Guessing Attacks?,"Offline Guessing Attacks include Exhaustive attacks and Intelligent attacks, such as Dictionary attacks."
Define an Offline Guessing Attack.,"An Offline Guessing Attack is a type of attack where the attacker first obtains the hashed passwords, and then attempts to guess the original passwords by trying various combinations against these hashes offline, without direct interaction with the system that stores the original passwords."
Why are Offline Guessing Attacks considered a plausible threat?,"Offline Guessing Attacks are a plausible threat due to several factors: many incidents involve the theft of hashed passwords as a consequence of hacks on servers or sniffing network traffic. Additionally, users often reuse the same passwords across different accounts, meaning the compromise of a password for one account can affect other accounts."
What is a Brute Force Attack in the context of passwords?,"A Brute Force Attack is a type of guessing attack against passwords where the attacker systematically tries to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. For each guessed password, its hash is computed and then checked against the target hashes to see if there is a match."
What measures can be taken to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"A key measure against a brute force attack is to increase the space of possible passwords. This can be achieved by using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, including alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs."
What role does password policy play in mitigating brute force attacks?,"Password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing policies that require longer passwords and a mix of character types (alphabets, numerals, signs), the number of possible password combinations increases significantly, making brute-forcing more time-consuming and computationally intensive."
How is password entropy measured according to the document?,"Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where 'k' represents the bitsize of the password space. The bitsize is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, which is calculated as c^n, where 'n' is the number of characters in the password and 'c' is the number of choices per character."
What is the current cracking capability of software password crackers mentioned in the document?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc)."
"According to Table 10.1, what is the bitsize of password space for a 5-character lowercase password?","According to Table 10.1, for a 5-character password using only lowercase letters (26 choices per character), the bitsize of the password space is 23.5."
"Based on Table 10.1, what is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?","Based on Table 10.1, for a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters (62 choices per character), the bitsize of the password space is 41.7."
What does 'c' represent in the context of password entropy calculation (c^n)?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'c' represents the number of choices per character, which refers to the size of the character set from which each character in the password can be chosen (e.g., 26 for lowercase, 62 for mixed case alphanumeric, 95 for keyboard characters)."
What does 'n' represent in the context of password entropy calculation (c^n)?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'n' represents the number of characters in the password, also known as the password length."
What was a critical vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack related to its SCM database?,"A critical vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack was that the SCM database, which is legally owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network that was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH). This open linkage created an exploitable pathway for the attacker."
What issues were identified regarding the monitoring of the SCM database during the SingHealth cyber attack?,"During the SingHealth cyber attack, it was found that there was a lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access. Specifically, there was no existing control to detect or block bulk queries being made to the database, and the Citrix servers of SGH were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues."
How was administrator access to Citrix servers compromised in the SingHealth incident?,"Administrator access to Citrix servers in the SingHealth incident was compromised because the servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Notably, the process requiring 2-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in, allowing the attacker to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA."
What specific password-related weakness was identified in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"A specific password-related weakness identified in the SingHealth cyber attack was the use of weak administrator account passwords. This weakness was among others discovered during a test, but remediation efforts were mismanaged, and vulnerabilities remained."
What was the scale of the Adobe data breach mentioned in the document?,"The Adobe data breach impacted at least 38 million users, exposing user account information and prompting a flurry of password reset emails. It also involved a massive source code leak that broadened to include Photoshop family products."
How many LinkedIn passwords were leaked in the incident mentioned?,"More than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. Although some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords."
What was the magnitude of the Russia gang hack mentioned in the document?,The Russia gang hack involved the compromise of 1.2 billion usernames and passwords.
How many credentials were posted to Pastebin in 2013 according to the document?,"More than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted on the clipboard website Pastebin.com in the year 2013 alone, based on an analysis by a Swiss security firm."
What vulnerability was found in the Starbucks mobile app regarding user information?,"A vulnerability in Starbucks' mobile app was found to be putting coffee drinkers' information, including their usernames, email addresses, and passwords, at risk because the app stored this information, including passwords, in clear text."
What does the term 'hashed text' refer to in the context of password storage?,"In the context of password storage, 'hashed text' refers to the output generated by a hash function when applied to a plain text password. This output is a fixed-size string of characters that represents the original password but is not reversible to obtain the plain text password."
What is the purpose of a hash function in password storage?,"The purpose of a hash function in password storage is to transform a plain text password into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. This hash is then stored instead of the actual password, providing a security measure by making it difficult to retrieve the original password even if the stored hashes are compromised."
What is the significance of using different passwords across different accounts?,"Using different passwords across different accounts is significant because if an attacker compromises a password for one account, it prevents that same password from being used to access other accounts. This limits the impact of a single password compromise, which is a common vulnerability exploited in offline guessing attacks."
What is a 'password table' in the context of hashed password verification?,"A 'password table' in the context of hashed password verification is a database or storage mechanism maintained by the verifier (system B) that stores the hashes of user passwords. For each user (e.g., Claimant A), it stores their identifier along with the corresponding hash of their password (e.g., h(password A)), but not the password itself."
What is the meaning of 'sniffing traffic' in relation to password security?,"'Sniffing traffic' refers to the act of intercepting and inspecting data packets that are transmitted over a network. In relation to password security, it means an attacker can capture network communications to obtain sensitive information, such as hashed passwords, if they are transmitted or stored insecurely."
What is an 'Exhaustive attack'?,"An 'Exhaustive attack,' also known as a brute-force attack, is a method of attack where the attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This is done by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes."
What is a 'Dictionary attack'?,A 'Dictionary attack' is a type of intelligent attack where the attacker attempts to guess passwords by trying words from a dictionary or a list of commonly used passwords. This method is more efficient than an exhaustive attack when users choose simple or common passwords.
What does '2FA' stand for and what is its purpose in security?,"2FA stands for Two-Factor Authentication. Its purpose in security is to add an extra layer of protection by requiring two different methods of verification to confirm a user's identity, typically something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a mobile device for a code) or something the user is (like a fingerprint). This makes it harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if they have a password."
What is the implication of passwords being stored in 'clear text'?,"The implication of passwords being stored in 'clear text' means that the passwords are saved in an unencrypted, readable format. This is a severe security vulnerability because if an attacker gains access to the storage location, they can immediately read and use the actual passwords, without needing to crack any hashes."
How does increasing password length contribute to security against brute force attacks?,"Increasing password length significantly contributes to security against brute force attacks by exponentially expanding the 'password space' – the total number of possible password combinations. A longer password means there are many more potential combinations for an attacker to try, making the brute force process much more time-consuming and computationally intensive, potentially to the point of being infeasible."
What is the significance of 'bitsize of password space'?,"The 'bitsize of password space' (measured by 2^k) is a logarithmic measure of the total number of possible passwords for a given length and character set. A higher bitsize indicates a larger and more complex password space, which directly correlates to greater resistance against brute-force attacks, as it takes more computational effort to enumerate all possibilities."
What is the primary goal of an attacker in an Offline Guessing Attack?,The primary goal of an attacker in an Offline Guessing Attack is to obtain the original plain text passwords by guessing them against a list of stolen hashed passwords. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without directly interacting with the live system.
Why is it important for the verifier not to store the actual passwords?,"It is important for the verifier not to store the actual passwords because if the verifier's system or database is compromised, the attacker would only gain access to password hashes, not the plain text passwords. This significantly increases the effort required for an attacker to obtain usable passwords, as they would still need to crack the hashes."
What is the role of `h(password)` in the hashed password verification diagram?,"In the hashed password verification diagram, `h(password)` represents the hash value computed by the verifier (system B) when it applies the hash function `h` to the password provided by the claimant (password, A). This computed hash is then used for comparison against the stored hash."
What does the 'ACCEPT' outcome signify in hashed password verification?,The 'ACCEPT' outcome in hashed password verification signifies that the hash of the password provided by the claimant matches the hash stored in the verifier's password table. This indicates that the claimant has provided the correct password and is authenticated.
What does the 'REJECT' outcome signify in hashed password verification?,The 'REJECT' outcome in hashed password verification signifies that the hash of the password provided by the claimant does not match the hash stored in the verifier's password table. This indicates that the claimant has provided an incorrect password and is not authenticated.
What is the difference between `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` in Unix/Linux systems regarding password storage?,"In traditional Unix systems, `/etc/passwd` stored password hashes. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, `/etc/passwd` primarily stores user account information, while the actual password hashes are moved to the more secure `/etc/shadow` file. This separation enhances security by restricting access to the sensitive password hashes."
What kind of data was at risk in the Starbucks app vulnerability?,"The Starbucks app vulnerability put coffee drinkers' information at risk, specifically their usernames, email addresses, and passwords, because these were stored in clear text."
What was the nature of the 'human lapses' contributing to the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The document states that the SingHealth cyber attack was a result of human lapses, alongside IT system weaknesses. While specific details of the human lapses are not fully elaborated, they contributed to vulnerabilities such as weak administrator account passwords and mismanagement of remediation processes."
How does the use of 'keyboard characters' (95 choices) affect password entropy compared to 'lowercase alphanumeric' (36 choices) for the same password length?,"The use of 'keyboard characters' (95 choices) significantly increases password entropy compared to 'lowercase alphanumeric' (36 choices) for the same password length. For example, a 10-character password with 95 choices has a bitsize of 65.7, whereas with 36 choices, it's 51.7. A larger character set ('c') leads to a much larger password space (c^n), making brute-force attacks more difficult."
What is the primary takeaway from the 'PASSWORD-RELATED INCIDENTS' section?,"The primary takeaway from the 'PASSWORD-RELATED INCIDENTS' section is that major data breaches and cyber attacks frequently involve the compromise of user credentials due to various vulnerabilities, including weak passwords, storing passwords in clear text, lack of proper monitoring, and inadequate security measures like unenforced multi-factor authentication. These incidents highlight the critical importance of robust password security practices."
