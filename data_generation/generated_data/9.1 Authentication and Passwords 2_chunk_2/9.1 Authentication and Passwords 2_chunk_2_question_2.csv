Where are password hashes stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in a password file. For Windows systems, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, specifically at ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"". In Unix systems, they were traditionally stored in /etc/passwd, but modern Unix/Linux systems store them in the shadow file located at /etc/shadow."
What is the purpose of the SAM file in Windows systems regarding password storage?,"In Windows systems, the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file is where passwords are stored. Its specific location is ""%windir%\system32\config\SAM"". The SAM file is a database file that stores user account information, including hashed passwords."
Explain the difference in password hash storage locations between traditional Unix and modern Unix/Linux systems.,"In traditional Unix systems, password hashes were stored in /etc/passwd. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, they are stored in the ""shadow"" file, which is located at /etc/shadow. The ""shadow"" file provides enhanced security by separating password hashes from other user information, making them less accessible to unauthorized users."
What are intermediate storage locations for passwords at the application level?,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even a web page. These are temporary holding areas that applications might use during processing or for convenience."
Who controls the management of temporary password storage locations at the application level?,"The management of temporary password storage locations at the application level, such as buffers, caches, or web pages, is normally beyond the control of the user. This means a password may be retained longer than the user intends or expects, potentially increasing exposure."
What is the fundamental principle of hashed password verification regarding password storage?,"The fundamental principle of hashed password verification is that the verifier does not store the actual passwords themselves, but only their hashes. A ""hash"" is a fixed-size string of characters that is generated from an input of any length using a one-way function. This ensures that even if the password database is compromised, the original passwords are not directly exposed."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a claimant providing a password, which is then hashed by the verifier system. This newly computed hash is compared against a stored hash value associated with the claimant in a ""password table"". If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the claimant is accepted; otherwise, the request is rejected. The ""verifier"" (system) only stores the hashes, not the original passwords."
What are the main categories of attacks on passwords?,"The main categories of attacks on passwords are ""Offline Guessing Attacks"" and ""Phishing and Spoofing""."
What are the two types of offline guessing attacks?,"The two types of offline guessing attacks are ""Exhaustive attacks"" and ""Intelligent attacks,"" which include ""Dictionary attacks""."
Define an offline guessing attack.,"An ""offline guessing attack"" is a type of attack where an attacker obtains the hashed passwords, typically from a compromised system, and then attempts to guess the original passwords by systematically trying different combinations or using pre-computed lists. The guessing process occurs ""offline,"" meaning the attacker does not interact directly with the live authentication system."
Why are offline guessing attacks considered a plausible threat?,"Offline guessing attacks are considered a plausible threat due to several factors: many incidents involve the theft of hashed passwords as a consequence of hacks on servers or ""sniffing traffic"", and users often reuse the same passwords across different accounts, meaning the compromise of a password for one account can affect other accounts."
How does an offline guessing attack typically proceed?,"An offline guessing attack typically proceeds by an attacker first obtaining ""hashed passwords"". These hashes are derived from ""plain text"" passwords using a ""hash function"". Once the attacker has the hashed text, they then attempt to guess the original plain text passwords by applying the same hash function to their guesses and comparing the resulting hashes to the stolen ones."
What was a critical vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack related to the SCM database?,"A critical vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth cyber attack was that the SCM database, which is owned by SingHealth, functioned on an open network. This open network was linked to the Citrix servers of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), creating an exploitable pathway for the attacker."
What monitoring weaknesses were identified in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"In the SingHealth cyber attack, a lack of monitoring of the SCM database for unusual queries and access was identified. Specifically, there was no existing control to detect or block bulk queries to the database, and the Citrix servers of SGH were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts regarding vulnerabilities and issues."
How did the SingHealth cyber attack exploit weaknesses in Citrix server authentication?,"The SingHealth cyber attack exploited weaknesses in Citrix server authentication because these servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The process requiring ""2-factor authentication (2FA)"" for administrator access was not enforced as the exclusive means of logging in. This allowed the attacker to access the server through other routes that did not require 2FA. ""2FA"" is a security process that requires two different methods of verification to prove identity."
What role did weak administrator account passwords play in the SingHealth cyber attack?,"Weak administrator account passwords were identified as another weakness that may have been exploited by the attacker in the SingHealth cyber attack. These weak passwords were among other vulnerabilities discovered during a test, but the remediation process undertaken by IHiS was mismanaged and inadequate, leaving these vulnerabilities present at the time of the attack."
What was the primary cause of the SingHealth cyber attack?,"The primary cause of the SingHealth cyber attack was a combination of human lapses by employees and vulnerabilities within the IT system. Ultimately, the breach into the public healthcare group's database was preventable even though the attacker was skilled."
How many users were impacted by the Adobe data breach?,The Adobe data breach impacted at least 38 million users. This breach exposed user account information and prompted a flurry of password reset emails.
What was the scale of the LinkedIn password leak?,"The LinkedIn password leak involved more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords that were leaked to the Web after an apparent hack. Although some login details were encrypted, all users were advised to change their passwords."
"What was the extent of the ""Russia gang"" hack mentioned in the document?","The ""Russia gang"" hack involved the compromise of 1.2 billion usernames and passwords."
"What was posted to Pastebin in 2013, according to the document?","In 2013, more than 300,000 credentials, including usernames and passwords, were posted to the clipboard website Pastebin.com, according to a recent analysis by a Swiss security firm."
What security vulnerability was found in the Starbucks mobile app?,"A security vulnerability was found in the Starbucks mobile app where it stored user information, including usernames, email addresses, and passwords, in ""CLEAR TEXT"". ""Clear text"" refers to data that is unencrypted and easily readable by anyone who gains access to it, making it highly vulnerable."
What is a brute force attack against passwords?,"A ""brute force attack"" against passwords is a guessing attack that attempts to discover a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks whether any of these generated hashes match the target hashes they are trying to crack."
What measures can be taken to defend against a brute force attack?,"A key measure against a brute force attack is to increase the ""space of possible passwords"". This can be achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs. Increasing the complexity and length of passwords makes it exponentially harder for an attacker to guess them."
What is the role of a password policy in mitigating brute force attacks?,"A ""password policy"" is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing rules for password creation, such as minimum length, inclusion of different character types (alphabets, numerals, signs), and disallowing common patterns, a password policy significantly expands the ""password space"", making it much harder for attackers to guess passwords."
How is password entropy measured according to the document?,"Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where ""k"" represents the bitsize of the password space. The ""bitsize"" is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, calculated as c^n, where ""n"" is the character length of the password and ""c"" is the number of choices per character."
What is the current cracking speed of software password crackers per PC?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer."
What does 'c' represent in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'c' represents the number of choices per character available for creating a password. For example, 'c' could be 26 for lowercase alphabets, 36 for lowercase alphanumeric characters, 62 for mixed-case alphanumeric characters, or 95 for keyboard characters."
What does 'n' represent in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'n' represents the number of characters in a password, also known as the password length."
"According to Table 10.1, what is the bitsize of a 5-character password using only lowercase alphanumeric characters?","According to the table, the bitsize of a 5-character password using only lowercase alphanumeric characters (where c=36) is 25.9. The ""bitsize"" is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords."
"According to Table 10.1, what is the bitsize of a 10-character password using mixed-case alphanumeric characters?","According to the table, the bitsize of a 10-character password using mixed-case alphanumeric characters (where c=62) is 59.5. The ""bitsize"" is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords."
What is the bitsize of a 7-character password using all 95 keyboard characters?,"The bitsize of a 7-character password using all 95 keyboard characters is 46.0. The ""bitsize"" is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, indicating its entropy."
What is the definition of a hash in the context of password storage?,"A ""hash"" is a fixed-size string of characters that is generated from an input of any length using a one-way mathematical function. In the context of password storage, instead of storing the actual password, its hash is stored. This one-way transformation makes it computationally infeasible to reverse the hash to find the original password, enhancing security."
What is the significance of the shadow file in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"The ""shadow"" file in modern Unix/Linux systems, located at /etc/shadow, is significant because it stores password hashes separately from other user information. This separation enhances security by restricting access to the sensitive password hashes, making them less vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure compared to the traditional /etc/passwd file."
What is 2-factor authentication (2FA)?,"""2-factor authentication (2FA)"" is a security process that requires two different methods of verification to prove identity. For example, it might require something a user knows (like a password) and something a user has (like a code from a mobile app or a physical token). This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a single password."
What is a password table in the context of hashed password verification?,"A ""password table"" is a data structure, typically within a verifier system, that stores the hashed versions of user passwords. When a user attempts to log in, the system computes the hash of the provided password and compares it against the corresponding hash stored in this table to authenticate the user."
What is an Exhaustive attack?,"An ""Exhaustive attack"", also known as a brute force attack, is a type of offline guessing attack where the attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method is guaranteed to find the password eventually but can be very time-consuming depending on the password's complexity and length."
What is a Dictionary attack?,"A ""Dictionary attack"" is a type of intelligent offline guessing attack where the attacker attempts to guess passwords by trying a predefined list of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords. This method is often more efficient than an exhaustive attack if users choose weak or common passwords."
What is Phishing?,"""Phishing"" is a type of attack on passwords that involves deceiving users into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, often by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. This typically involves fake websites or emails designed to look legitimate."
What is Spoofing?,"""Spoofing"" is a type of attack on passwords where an attacker disguises themselves as a legitimate entity or person to gain unauthorized access to systems or information. This can involve faking an IP address, email address, or website to trick users into believing they are interacting with a trusted source."
What does 'bitsize of password space' refer to?,"The ""bitsize of password space"" refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords that can be generated given a certain character set and password length. It is a measure of the entropy or randomness of the password, indicating how difficult it would be to guess through brute force. It is measured as 'k' where the total number of passwords is 2^k."
What is the implication of passwords being stored in CLEAR TEXT?,"The implication of passwords being stored in ""CLEAR TEXT"" is a severe security vulnerability. ""Clear text"" means the passwords are unencrypted and directly readable. If an attacker gains access to the storage location, they can immediately obtain all user passwords without needing to crack any hashes, making the system highly susceptible to compromise."
"What is the general recommendation for users whose passwords have been leaked online, even if some are encrypted?","The general recommendation for users whose passwords have been leaked online, even if some login details are encrypted, is to change their passwords immediately. This is a crucial step to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to their accounts, as even encrypted passwords can eventually be cracked."
What is the significance of 'sniffing traffic' in the context of password attacks?,"""Sniffing traffic"" refers to intercepting and reading data packets as they travel across a network. In the context of password attacks, it is significant because attackers can use it to obtain hashed passwords (or even plain text passwords if not properly secured) that are transmitted over the network, which can then be used in offline guessing attacks."
How does password reuse contribute to the plausibility of offline guessing attacks?,"Password reuse significantly contributes to the plausibility of offline guessing attacks because if an attacker compromises a password for one account, they can then attempt to use that same password (or its hash) to gain access to other accounts belonging to the same user. This multiplies the impact of a single password compromise across multiple services."
What is the definition of a verifier in the context of hashed password verification?,"A ""verifier"" is a system or component responsible for authenticating a claimant by checking the provided password against stored credentials. In hashed password verification, the verifier does not store the actual passwords but rather their hashes, comparing a newly computed hash from the claimant's input against the stored hash to determine acceptance or rejection."
What is the relationship between password length and the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"There is a direct relationship between password length and the difficulty of a brute force attack: increasing the password length exponentially increases the ""space of possible passwords"". This makes it significantly more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all possible combinations and guess the password."
What is the relationship between the variety of symbols used in a password and the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"Increasing the variety of symbols used in a password (e.g., including alphabets, numerals, and signs) directly increases the ""space of possible passwords"". This means there are more potential characters for each position in the password, making it exponentially harder for a brute force attack to guess the correct combination."
What was the role of IHiS in the SingHealth cyber attack remediation process?,"IHiS was responsible for the remediation process following the discovery of vulnerabilities in the SingHealth system. However, their efforts were mismanaged and inadequate, resulting in a number of vulnerabilities remaining unaddressed at the time of the cyber attack."
Why is it crucial for a verifier not to store actual passwords?,"It is crucial for a verifier not to store actual passwords because if the system's database is compromised, the original passwords would be directly exposed to attackers. By storing only ""hashes"" (one-way transformations of passwords), even if the hashes are stolen, it is computationally infeasible for attackers to reverse them to obtain the original passwords, thus protecting user credentials."
