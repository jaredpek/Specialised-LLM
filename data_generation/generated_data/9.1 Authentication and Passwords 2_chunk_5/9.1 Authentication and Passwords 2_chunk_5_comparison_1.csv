Compare salting with a scenario where passwords are hashed without a salt.,"Salting involves adding a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, to each password as part of the hashing process. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. Without salting, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords (e.g., using rainbow tables or database-based lookups) and quickly compare them against all stored hashes, making large-scale cracking much easier. Salting also ensures that even if two users have the same password, their different salts will result in different hashes, making it impossible to determine password commonality without cracking."
What are the differences between modern password hashing algorithms and fast crypto hashes like SHA family or KECCAK?,"Modern password hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, are specifically designed for securely storing passwords by being intentionally slow. Their slowness can be configured using a ""work factor,"" which makes brute-force attacks more computationally expensive. In contrast, crypto hashes like the SHA family and KECCAK are designed to be fast, which is suitable for general cryptographic purposes but makes them less secure for password storage as it allows attackers to test many more password guesses per second. Modern hashing algorithms also automatically salt passwords, adding a unique, randomly generated string to each password as part of the hashing process, which protects against pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables."
Compare Argon2 with bcrypt for password storage.,"Argon2 is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, indicating its superior design for password storage. Bcrypt is recommended as the second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available. Both are modern hashing algorithms designed to be slow and automatically salt passwords, making them suitable for secure password storage."
"What are the advantages and disadvantages of forcing users to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords?","While forcing users to use long passwords, mixing upper and lower case characters and numerical symbols, generated by the system, and changed repeatedly might seem to offer the highest security, it presents several disadvantages. Users may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, potentially leading them to write them down, which compromises security. They may also have difficulty dealing with frequent password changes, which could lead to them finding ways to re-use their favorite password or choosing simpler, more guessable ones."
Compare the security implications of having a password for a user account versus having no password.,"If a user account has no password, an attacker does not even have to guess it, gaining immediate access. Conversely, setting a password for a user account acts as a fundamental barrier, requiring an attacker to guess or crack the password to gain unauthorized access, thereby significantly increasing the security of the account."
What are the risks of leaving default passwords unchanged compared to changing them?,"Default passwords, often simple values like ""manager"" for system accounts, are known and can be easily exploited by attackers if left unchanged. This makes it easy for an attacker to break into a system. Changing default passwords removes this known vulnerability, forcing attackers to guess or crack a unique password, significantly increasing the security of the system."
Compare the security benefits of prescribing a minimal password length with having no such policy.,"Prescribing a minimal password length directly increases the number of possible combinations an attacker would need to try in a brute-force attack, making passwords harder to guess or crack. Without a minimal password length policy, users might choose very short and easily guessable passwords, significantly lowering the security of their accounts."
"How does a strong password format (mix case, numeric, symbols) enhance security compared to a simple format?","A strong password format that requires a mix of upper and lower case characters (case-sensitive), numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric) vastly expands the character set available for password creation. This increases the complexity and entropy of passwords, making them significantly harder for attackers to guess or brute-force compared to passwords that only use a limited character set, such as only lowercase letters."
Compare the effectiveness of password ageing (expiry dates) in forcing regular changes versus a policy without expiry dates.,"Password ageing, by setting expiry dates for passwords, forces users to change their passwords regularly. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a compromised password. A policy without expiry dates allows passwords to remain unchanged indefinitely, meaning a compromised password could be used for an extended period, increasing the risk of unauthorized access."
What is the importance of preventing users from reverting to old passwords compared to allowing it?,"Preventing users from reverting to old passwords, for example, by keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used, ensures that users create genuinely new passwords. If users are allowed to revert to old passwords, they might cycle through a small set of familiar passwords, making it easier for an attacker who has previously compromised one of their old passwords to regain access."
Compare the security implications of limiting login attempts versus allowing unlimited attempts.,"Limiting login attempts means the system monitors unsuccessful login attempts and can react by locking the user account (either completely or for a given time interval). This prevents or discourages further brute-force or dictionary attacks by making it impossible for an attacker to try an infinite number of password guesses. Allowing unlimited login attempts provides an attacker with an unrestricted opportunity to guess passwords, making brute-force attacks highly feasible and increasing the risk of account compromise."
What is the benefit of informing a user about their last login time and failed attempts compared to not providing this information?,"Informing a user about the time of their last successful login and the number of failed login attempts since their last login, displayed after a successful login, serves as an early warning system. This allows the user to detect recently attempted attacks or unauthorized access to their account. Without this information, a user would be unaware of such attempts, potentially leaving their account vulnerable for longer."
Compare a passphrase with a traditional password in terms of memorability and system processing.,"A passphrase involves a user entering sentences or long phrases that are generally easier to remember than complex, arbitrary traditional passwords. The system then applies a hash function to compute a fixed-size actual password from this passphrase. Traditional passwords, while often shorter, can be harder to memorize if they are complex, and are directly hashed by the system without an intermediate passphrase step."
What are the differences between visual drawing patterns and picture passwords as alternative authentication methods?,"Visual drawing patterns are used on touch interfaces, such as in Android, where a user draws a specific pattern on a grid or set of points. Picture passwords, used in Windows 8, involve selecting specific objects or patterns within a given picture. Both are visual authentication methods, but their interaction mechanisms differ: one relies on drawing a sequence, the other on identifying specific elements."
Compare cryptographic protection of the password file with access control enforced by the operating system.,"Cryptographic protection of the password file involves encrypting the file itself, making its contents unreadable without the correct decryption key. Access control enforced by the operating system, on the other hand, restricts who (which users or processes) can read, write, or modify the password file based on permissions. While cryptographic protection secures the data at rest, access control secures who can interact with the file. Both aim to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the password file."
What are the advantages of combining cryptographic protection and access control for the password file compared to using either method alone?,"Combining cryptographic protection and access control for the password file offers a layered security approach. Cryptographic protection ensures that even if an attacker bypasses access controls and gains access to the file, its contents remain unreadable without the decryption key. Access control prevents unauthorized users or processes from even reaching the encrypted file. Using either method alone leaves a potential vulnerability: access control alone doesn't protect if the file is copied, and cryptographic protection alone doesn't prevent unauthorized access attempts to the encrypted file."
"How do additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks enhance the protection of a password file, especially when combined with cryptographic protection and access control?","Additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks, when combined with cryptographic protection and access control, provide an extra layer of defense against brute-force guessing. These measures, such as intentionally slow hashing algorithms (like those using a work factor) or rate limiting, make it computationally expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to test a large number of password guesses, even if they manage to obtain the encrypted password file. This significantly increases the effort and resources required for a successful attack, complementing the confidentiality provided by encryption and the access restrictions from OS controls."
Compare the time required to crack a large number of salted hashes versus the time required for the same number of unsalted hashes.,"When hashes are salted, the time required to crack a large number of hashes grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, because an attacker must crack each hash one at a time using its unique salt. In contrast, for unsalted hashes, an attacker could calculate a hash once for a common password and compare it against every stored hash, meaning the time required to crack a large number of hashes would not grow proportionally, making it significantly faster to crack many at once."
What is the difference in how an attacker approaches cracking salted hashes versus unsalted hashes?,"When dealing with salted hashes, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each password. This means pre-computing rainbow tables is ineffective, and each hash requires individual processing. For unsalted hashes, an attacker can calculate a hash once for a given password and then compare that single hash against every stored hash in the database, making it much more efficient to find matches for common passwords across many accounts."
Compare the configurability of modern hashing algorithms (via work factor) with the fixed nature of fast crypto hashes.,"Modern password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow, and their slowness can be configured by changing a ""work factor."" This allows administrators to adjust the computational cost of hashing, increasing it over time to keep pace with advancements in computing power and maintain security. Fast crypto hashes, such as the SHA family and KECCAK, are designed with a fixed, high-speed performance in mind, without a configurable work factor, making them less adaptable to evolving security needs for password storage."
"Compare the security risk of a system account having a default password like ""manager"" with a system account that requires a unique, non-default password.","A system account with a default password like ""manager"" poses a significant security risk because these default values are widely known and can be easily exploited by attackers, allowing them to break in without guessing. Conversely, a system account that requires a unique, non-default password forces an attacker to guess or crack an unknown value, dramatically increasing the difficulty and time required for unauthorized access, thereby enhancing security."
What is the difference in attacker effort when dealing with a system that has default passwords versus one where default passwords have been changed?,"When a system has default passwords that remain unchanged, an attacker's effort is minimal; they can simply use known default values to gain access. This is an easy way for an attacker to break in. If default passwords have been changed, the attacker is forced to expend significant effort in guessing, brute-forcing, or cracking a unique, unknown password, making the attack much harder and more time-consuming."
Compare the security implications of a case-sensitive password format versus a case-insensitive one.,"A case-sensitive password format, which requires a mix of upper and lower case characters, significantly increases the complexity and length of the potential character space for a password. This makes it much harder for an attacker to guess or brute-force the password compared to a case-insensitive format, where 'Password' and 'password' would be treated as the same, effectively reducing the search space and making it easier for an attacker to succeed."
Compare the security of a password that includes numerical and non-alphabetical symbols with one that only uses alphabetical characters.,"A password that includes numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric) significantly increases its complexity and the size of the character set an attacker must consider. This makes it much harder to guess or brute-force compared to a password that only uses alphabetical characters, which has a smaller character set and thus a smaller search space for an attacker."
What is the difference in how password ageing affects user behavior regarding password changes compared to a policy without ageing?,"Password ageing, by setting expiry dates, directly forces users to change their passwords regularly, establishing a routine of updates. Without a password ageing policy, users are not compelled to change their passwords, often leading to them keeping the same password for extended periods, which increases the risk if that password is ever compromised."
"Compare the security benefit of keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used to prevent re-use, versus not having such a mechanism.","Keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used prevents users from reverting to old passwords, ensuring that each new password is distinct. This enhances security by preventing attackers from exploiting a previously compromised password if a user simply cycles back to it. Without such a mechanism, users might reuse old passwords, making it easier for an attacker who has already obtained one of their past credentials to regain access."
How does the system's ability to monitor unsuccessful login attempts enhance security compared to a system that does not monitor such attempts?,"A system that monitors unsuccessful login attempts can detect and react to potential brute-force or dictionary attacks by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This actively prevents or discourages further attempts. A system that does not monitor such attempts allows attackers to make an unlimited number of guesses without any consequence, making it significantly easier for them to eventually succeed in compromising an account."
Compare the security impact of locking a user account completely after failed login attempts versus locking it for a given time interval.,"Locking a user account completely after a certain number of failed login attempts provides a strong deterrent, requiring administrative intervention to unlock, which can be inconvenient but highly secure. Locking it for a given time interval offers a balance, temporarily preventing further attempts while allowing the legitimate user to try again after the lockout period, which is less disruptive but still effective in slowing down automated attacks."
What is the difference in user awareness about potential attacks when they are informed about last login and failed attempts versus when they are not?,"When users are informed about the time of their last successful login and the number of failed login attempts since, they gain immediate awareness of any suspicious activity or recently attempted attacks on their account. This allows them to take prompt action. Without this information, users remain unaware of such attempts, leaving them vulnerable to ongoing or future attacks without their knowledge."
Compare the protection against pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables when salting is used versus when it is not.,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups because each password has a unique, randomly generated salt. This means that even identical passwords will produce different hashes, rendering pre-computed tables useless. Without salting, an attacker could use pre-computed rainbow tables, which contain hashes for common passwords, to quickly find matches against stored hashes, significantly compromising security."
"Explain how salting prevents determining if two users have the same password, contrasting it with a non-salted scenario.","Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes, because the different unique salts added to each password will result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical. In a non-salted scenario, if two users had the same password, their hashes would be identical, making it trivial for an attacker to identify users sharing the same password."
"What is the role of a salt in the hashing process, and how does it differ from just hashing the password directly?","A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. Its role is to ensure that even identical passwords produce different hashes, making pre-computed attacks like rainbow tables ineffective and forcing attackers to crack each hash individually. Hashing the password directly, without a salt, would result in identical hashes for identical passwords, making it vulnerable to such pre-computation attacks and allowing an attacker to easily identify common passwords."
Compare modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords with older methods that might require manual salting or no salting at all.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt passwords, meaning no additional steps are required from the developer to implement salting. This ensures that every password is uniquely salted by default, enhancing security. Older methods might require manual implementation of salting, which could be prone to errors or omissions, or might not incorporate salting at all, leaving passwords vulnerable to pre-computation attacks."
"What makes Argon2 a preferred choice over bcrypt for password storage, according to the document?","According to the document, Argon2 is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, which positions it as the preferred choice for password storage. Bcrypt is recommended as the second choice if Argon2 is not available, implying Argon2's superior design or performance in the context of secure password hashing."
"Compare the perceived security benefits of complex, system-generated passwords with the practical challenges users face.","While complex, system-generated passwords are perceived to offer high security due to their randomness and strength, users face practical challenges such as difficulty memorizing them. This often leads to insecure behaviors like writing passwords down or finding ways to re-use favorite passwords, ultimately undermining the intended security benefits."
What are the security risks associated with users writing down their passwords compared to memorizing them?,"Users writing down their passwords, especially on a piece of paper kept close to the computer, introduces a significant physical security risk. If an attacker gains physical access to the user's environment, the written password can be easily discovered. Memorizing passwords, conversely, keeps the credentials solely in the user's mind, eliminating this physical vulnerability and making it harder for an attacker to obtain the password without direct interaction with the user."
Compare the security impact of frequent password changes on users versus less frequent changes.,"Frequent password changes, enforced by policies like password ageing, aim to reduce the window of opportunity for a compromised password to be exploited. However, users may have difficulty dealing with these frequent changes, potentially leading them to choose simpler, more guessable passwords or to re-use old ones, which can inadvertently decrease overall security. Less frequent changes might lead to longer exposure if a password is compromised but could encourage users to create and remember stronger, unique passwords."
"How does the re-use of favorite passwords by users impact security, compared to using unique passwords?","The re-use of favorite passwords by users significantly compromises security because if one account using that password is breached, all other accounts using the same password become vulnerable. Using unique passwords for each service ensures that a breach of one account does not automatically compromise others, thereby containing the damage and maintaining overall security."
"Compare the security implications of using guessable passwords versus strong, non-dictionary-based passwords.","Using guessable passwords, especially those found in on-line dictionaries, makes accounts highly vulnerable to dictionary attacks, where attackers try common words and phrases. Strong, non-dictionary-based passwords, which mix upper and lower case, numerical, and non-alphabetical symbols, are significantly harder to guess or crack through dictionary attacks, thereby offering much greater security."
How do on-line dictionaries impact the security of guessable passwords compared to a time before their widespread availability?,"Today, on-line dictionaries for almost every language exist, making it significantly easier and faster for attackers to perform dictionary attacks against guessable passwords. This means that passwords based on common words or phrases are much more vulnerable now than in a time before the widespread availability of such comprehensive dictionaries, when attackers would have had a more limited set of words to try."
Compare one-time passwords with static passwords based on their nature.,"One-time passwords are a form of authentication where a password is valid for only a single login session or transaction. This inherently differs from static passwords, which remain constant until explicitly changed by the user. The ""one-time"" nature of these passwords provides enhanced security against replay attacks or credential theft, as a compromised one-time password cannot be reused for subsequent access."
"Compare the general concept of alternative forms of password (passphrase, visual drawing, picture, one-time) with traditional text-based passwords.","Alternative forms of password, such as passphrases, visual drawing patterns, picture passwords, and one-time passwords, offer different interaction methods and security properties compared to traditional text-based passwords. These alternatives often aim to improve memorability (passphrases), leverage different input modalities (visual drawing, picture), or enhance security against reuse (one-time passwords), moving beyond the simple alphanumeric string input of traditional passwords."
How do visual drawing patterns function on a touch interface compared to picture passwords which involve selecting objects?,"Visual drawing patterns, typically used on touch interfaces (e.g., Android), require the user to draw a specific sequence or shape by connecting points or swiping across a grid. Picture passwords, used in systems like Windows 8, involve the user selecting specific objects or patterns within a static image. The former relies on a dynamic gesture, while the latter relies on static object recognition within a visual context."
Compare the confidentiality and integrity risks to a password file if it is unprotected versus protected by cryptographic means.,"If a password file is unprotected, its confidentiality and integrity are highly vulnerable; an attacker who gains access can read and potentially modify all user names and passwords directly. When protected by cryptographic means, the file's contents are encrypted, meaning an attacker would need the correct decryption key to compromise its confidentiality, and any unauthorized modification would likely render the data unusable or detectable, thus protecting its integrity."
Compare the confidentiality and integrity risks to a password file if it is unprotected versus protected by access control.,"An unprotected password file is at high risk of compromise, as any attacker gaining system access could read or modify it. When protected by access control enforced by the operating system, specific permissions dictate which users or processes can interact with the file. This significantly reduces the risk to confidentiality by restricting unauthorized viewing and protects integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications, as only authorized entities can perform these actions."
"What are the implications of salting being unique for every user versus a universal salt (hypothetical, but implied by ""unique for every user"")?","As the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, making cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder. If a universal salt were used (which is not recommended and not described as salting in the document), an attacker could potentially pre-compute hashes for common passwords combined with that single salt, and then compare them against all stored hashes, undermining the primary security benefit of salting."
Compare the security provided by salting against an attacker pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables versus a scenario without salting.,"Salting specifically protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Because a unique, randomly generated salt is added to each password, even identical passwords will produce different hashes, rendering pre-computed rainbow tables ineffective. Without salting, an attacker could easily use pre-computed rainbow tables to quickly find matches for common passwords across a database of stored hashes, significantly compromising security."
How does the time required to crack hashes differ when salting is used compared to when it is not?,"When salting is used, the time required to crack large numbers of hashes grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, because each hash must be cracked individually with its unique salt. This makes cracking significantly harder. Without salting, an attacker could calculate a hash once for a common password and compare it against every stored hash, meaning the time required would not scale proportionally, making it much faster to crack many hashes."
"Compare the security of a password storage system that uses modern hashing algorithms with one that uses older, faster cryptographic hashes.","A password storage system using modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 is designed for security by being intentionally slow and automatically salting passwords. This makes brute-force and pre-computation attacks computationally expensive and difficult. A system using older, faster cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA family, KECCAK) is less secure for password storage because their speed allows attackers to test many more password guesses per second, making brute-force attacks more feasible and efficient."
What is the difference in how a 'work factor' enhances security in modern hashing algorithms compared to algorithms without such a feature?,"A 'work factor' in modern hashing algorithms allows the slowness of the hashing process to be configured. By increasing the work factor, the computational cost and time required to hash a password (and thus to crack it) can be adjusted, making brute-force attacks progressively harder as computing power increases. Algorithms without such a feature have a fixed speed, which can become a security vulnerability over time as hardware capabilities improve, making them more susceptible to faster cracking."
Compare the security of a system where users may find ways of re-using their favourite password versus a system that strictly enforces unique passwords.,"In a system where users may find ways of re-using their favourite password, security is compromised because a breach of one account could lead to the compromise of multiple accounts if the same password is used. A system that strictly enforces unique passwords for each account, for example by preventing reversion to old passwords, significantly enhances security by ensuring that a compromise of one password does not automatically expose other accounts."
What is the difference in security posture between a system that allows unlimited login attempts and one that locks accounts after a few failures?,"A system that allows unlimited login attempts provides an attacker with an unrestricted opportunity to guess passwords, making brute-force and dictionary attacks highly effective. In contrast, a system that locks user accounts (either completely or for a time interval) after a few unsuccessful login attempts significantly improves security by preventing or discouraging further attempts, thereby making brute-force attacks impractical and protecting accounts from unauthorized access."
Compare the security of a password file protected by a combination of cryptographic protection and access control with one protected by only cryptographic protection.,"A password file protected by a combination of cryptographic protection and access control offers superior security. Cryptographic protection encrypts the file's contents, making them unreadable without the key, while access control restricts who can even access the encrypted file. If only cryptographic protection is used, an attacker might still be able to access the encrypted file and attempt to decrypt it without the additional barrier of operating system-enforced access restrictions."
Compare the security of a password file protected by a combination of cryptographic protection and access control with one protected by only access control.,"A password file protected by a combination of cryptographic protection and access control provides a robust defense. Access control limits who can interact with the file, while cryptographic protection encrypts its contents. If only access control is used, an attacker who manages to bypass the operating system's access controls (e.g., by exploiting a vulnerability) would gain direct access to the unencrypted password data, compromising its confidentiality and integrity."
