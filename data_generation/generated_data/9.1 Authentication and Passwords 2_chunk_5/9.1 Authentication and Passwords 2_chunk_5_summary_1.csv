Provide a comprehensive summary of salting in password storage.,"Salting is a security measure in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, called a ""salt,"" is added to each password before it undergoes the hashing process. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Explain how salting enhances password security against pre-computation attacks.,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using ""rainbow tables"" or ""database-based lookups."" A ""rainbow table"" is a pre-computed table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, typically for cracking passwords. ""Database-based lookups"" refer to similar pre-computed collections of hashes. By adding a unique salt to each password, the resulting hash is unique even for identical passwords, rendering pre-computed tables ineffective as the attacker would need a pre-computed table for every possible salt-password combination."
Can you summarise the key considerations behind the uniqueness of salts for each user?,"The uniqueness of a salt for every user is a critical consideration in password storage. Because the salt is unique for each user, an attacker cannot calculate a hash once and compare it against every stored hash. Instead, the attacker is forced to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each user. This significantly increases the computational effort and time required for an attacker to compromise multiple user accounts, making large-scale cracking much harder."
How does salting prevent determining if two users share the same password?,"Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the individual hashes. This is because different salts will result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical. For example, if two users choose ""password123"" but have different unique salts, their stored hashes will be distinct, preventing an attacker from identifying shared passwords by simply comparing hash values."
Which modern hashing algorithms automatically incorporate salting?,"Modern hashing algorithms such as ""Argon2id,"" ""bcrypt,"" and ""PBKDF2"" automatically salt the passwords. This means that when these algorithms are used, no additional steps are required by the developer or system administrator to generate and apply a unique salt, as it is an inherent part of their design for secure password storage."
Summarise the characteristics of modern password hashing algorithms.,"Modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed for securely storing passwords. A key characteristic is that they are intentionally ""slow,"" unlike traditional cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512) and KECCAK, which are designed to be fast. This slowness is a security feature, making brute-force attacks computationally expensive. The degree of slowness can be configured by changing a parameter known as the ""work factor."""
"Explain the concept of ""work factor"" in password hashing algorithms.","The ""work factor"" is a configurable parameter in modern password hashing algorithms that determines how computationally intensive (and thus how slow) the hashing process is. By increasing the work factor, the time required to compute a hash increases, which in turn makes brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks more time-consuming and expensive for an attacker. This allows system administrators to adjust the security level based on available computational resources and evolving threat landscapes."
Which hashing algorithm is considered the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,"""Argon2"" is the hashing algorithm that won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. This competition aimed to identify a new password hashing algorithm that would be resistant to various attacks, including brute-force and dictionary attacks, and suitable for modern hardware."
What is the recommended second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available?,"If ""Argon2"" is not available for password storage, the ""bcrypt"" password hashing function should be considered the second choice. Bcrypt is another strong, adaptive password hashing function designed to be resistant to brute-force attacks through its configurable work factor."
Compare modern password hashing algorithms with crypto hashes like SHA family and KECCAK.,"Modern password hashing algorithms, such as Argon2 and bcrypt, are specifically designed to be ""slow"" and resource-intensive, making them suitable for securely storing passwords by hindering brute-force attacks. In contrast, ""crypto hashes"" like the ""SHA family"" (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512) and ""KECCAK"" (which is the basis for SHA-3) are designed to be ""fast"" and efficient for general-purpose cryptographic tasks like data integrity checks or digital signatures, where speed is a desirable characteristic. Their speed makes them unsuitable for direct password storage without additional measures like salting and stretching."
Summarise the challenges associated with forcing users to adopt highly complex and frequently changed passwords.,"Forcing users to use long, complex passwords (mixing upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols), generated by the system, and changed repeatedly presents several challenges. Users may have difficulty memorizing such complex passwords, leading to them writing them down. They may also struggle with frequent password changes, potentially leading to them finding ways to re-use their favorite passwords or choosing simpler, more predictable ones."
Is it always a bad idea to write down your password?,"The document implies that writing down passwords, especially complex ones, is a common user behavior when faced with memorization difficulties. It states, ""Passwords will be written on a piece of paper kept close to the computer."" While not explicitly stating if it's ""always a bad idea,"" the context suggests it's a security risk as it makes the password vulnerable to physical discovery."
What is the fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account?,"The fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account is to prevent unauthorized access. If there is no password for a user account, an attacker does not even have to guess it, meaning they can gain immediate access to the account and its associated resources without any effort."
Why is it crucial to change default passwords on system accounts?,"It is crucial to change ""default passwords"" on system accounts because they often have common, well-known values like ""manager."" While these default passwords help field engineers during system installation, if left unchanged, they make it easy for an attacker to break into the system. An attacker can simply try these known default credentials to gain unauthorized access."
What are the key strategies for avoiding guessable passwords?,"Key strategies for avoiding guessable passwords include prescribing a minimal ""password length"" and enforcing a specific ""password format."" The password format should require a mix of upper and lower case characters (""case-sensitive""), and include numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (""alphanumeric""). This is important because ""on-line dictionaries"" for almost every language exist today, which attackers can use to try common words and phrases."
"Define ""password length"" in the context of password policies.","""Password length"" refers to the minimum number of characters required for a password as part of a security policy. Prescribing a minimal password length is a strategy to avoid guessable passwords, as longer passwords generally offer a larger keyspace, making them harder to crack through brute-force or dictionary attacks."
"Explain ""password format"" requirements for strong passwords.","""Password format"" requirements dictate the types of characters that must be included in a password to enhance its strength. For strong passwords, the format typically requires a mix of upper and lower case characters (meaning it is ""case-sensitive""), and the inclusion of numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (making it ""alphanumeric""). This diversity of character types increases the complexity and resistance to guessing."
"What does ""case-sensitive"" mean in the context of passwords?","In the context of passwords, ""case-sensitive"" means that the system distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, ""Password123"" would be considered different from ""password123."" This requirement increases the number of possible character combinations, thereby enhancing password strength."
"Define ""alphanumeric"" symbols in password policies.","""Alphanumeric"" symbols refer to characters that include both alphabetical letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerical digits (0-9). In password policies, requiring alphanumeric symbols means that passwords must contain a combination of these character types, often alongside other non-alphabetical symbols, to increase complexity and make them less guessable."
"What are ""on-line dictionaries"" and how do they relate to password security?","""On-line dictionaries"" are collections of words, phrases, and common passwords that attackers use in ""dictionary attacks"" to guess passwords. They relate to password security because if passwords are based on common words or simple combinations, they can be easily compromised using these dictionaries. This is why password policies emphasize using complex formats that include alphanumeric and special characters, making dictionary attacks less effective."
Summarise the concept and purpose of password ageing.,"""Password ageing"" is a security policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords. Its purpose is to force users to change their passwords regularly. This practice aims to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a compromised password, as even if a password is stolen, it will eventually expire and become invalid."
How do password policies prevent users from reverting to old passwords?,"Password policies prevent users from reverting to old passwords by keeping a record, such as a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used. This mechanism ensures that when a user is forced to change their password due to ""password ageing"" or other policies, they cannot simply reuse a recently discarded password, thereby maintaining a higher level of security."
Explain how systems limit login attempts to enhance security.,"Systems limit login attempts by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain number of failed attempts occur, the system can react by ""locking the user account,"" either completely or for a given time interval. This measure is designed to prevent or discourage ""brute-force attacks"" or ""dictionary attacks"" where an attacker repeatedly tries to guess a password."
Why is it important to inform users about recent login activity?,"It is important to inform users about recent login activity to warn them about recently attempted attacks. After a successful login, the system should display information such as the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since. This allows users to identify suspicious activity on their account and take appropriate action if unauthorized access attempts have occurred."
"What is an ""expiry date"" for passwords?","An ""expiry date"" for passwords is a predetermined date or time after which a password becomes invalid and must be changed. This is a component of ""password ageing"" policies, designed to force regular password changes and reduce the risk associated with long-term use of a single password."
"What does ""locking the user account"" mean in the context of login attempt limits?","""Locking the user account"" in the context of login attempt limits means that the system temporarily or permanently disables access to a user's account after a specified number of unsuccessful login attempts. This action prevents further login attempts from that account, thereby mitigating ""brute-force attacks"" or ""dictionary attacks"" by an unauthorized party."
"Describe ""passphrase"" as an alternative form of password.","A ""passphrase"" is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are typically easier to remember than complex, random character strings. The system then applies a ""hash function"" to compute the actual (fixed-size) password from this passphrase. This combines memorability for the user with cryptographic strength for storage."
"Explain ""visual drawing patterns"" as an alternative password method.","""Visual drawing patterns"" are an alternative password method primarily used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern or sequence on a grid of points or images. This method leverages spatial memory and motor skills rather than alphanumeric recall."
"What are ""picture passwords"" and where are they used?","""Picture passwords"" are an alternative password method where users select specific objects or patterns within a given picture. This method relies on visual recognition and memory. They were notably used in Windows 8 as an authentication option."
"Define ""one-time passwords.""","""One-time passwords"" (OTPs) are passwords that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and used in conjunction with a static password or as a second factor in multi-factor authentication. Once used, an OTP cannot be reused, enhancing security against replay attacks."
How do passphrases utilize hash functions for security?,"Passphrases utilize ""hash functions"" for security by taking the user's easily remembered sentence or long phrase as input and computing a ""fixed-size"" actual password. The ""hash function"" is a one-way mathematical algorithm that transforms the input into a unique, fixed-length string of characters. This means the actual passphrase is never stored directly, only its hash, protecting it even if the stored data is compromised."
"What is the primary concern regarding the ""password file""?","The primary concern regarding the ""password file"" is that an attacker could try to compromise its ""confidentiality"" or ""integrity."" ""Confidentiality"" refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of the passwords, while ""integrity"" refers to preventing unauthorized modification or deletion of the password data. This file, maintained by the operating system, contains user names and their corresponding passwords (or hashes)."
What are the main options for protecting the password file?,"The main options for protecting the ""password file"" include ""cryptographic protection,"" ""access control enforced by the operating system,"" or a combination of both. Further measures can also be added to slow down ""dictionary attacks."""
"Describe ""cryptographic protection"" for a password file.","""Cryptographic protection"" for a password file involves using encryption or hashing techniques to secure the contents of the file. This means that even if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the file, the passwords (or their hashes) are unreadable or difficult to reverse without the appropriate decryption key or significant computational effort, thereby protecting their ""confidentiality."""
"Explain ""access control enforced by the operating system"" in the context of password file protection.","""Access control enforced by the operating system"" for password file protection refers to the mechanisms within the operating system that restrict who can read, write, or execute the password file. This ensures that only authorized users or system processes have the necessary permissions to interact with the file, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining its ""confidentiality"" and ""integrity."""
How can a combination of protection methods be used for the password file?,"A combination of protection methods for the password file typically involves both ""cryptographic protection"" and ""access control enforced by the operating system."" This multi-layered approach provides robust security. Additionally, further measures can be implemented to slow down ""dictionary attacks,"" such as using strong hashing algorithms with high ""work factors"" and salting."
"What is a ""password file""?","A ""password file"" is a file maintained by the operating system that stores user names and their associated passwords or, more commonly and securely, cryptographic hashes of their passwords. This file is a critical component of system security, as its compromise can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts."
"Define ""confidentiality"" in the context of protecting a password file.","""Confidentiality"" in the context of protecting a password file refers to the principle of ensuring that the information within the file (i.e., user names and passwords/hashes) is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals or entities. Protecting confidentiality means preventing unauthorized viewing or access to the sensitive data."
"Define ""integrity"" in the context of protecting a password file.","""Integrity"" in the context of protecting a password file refers to the principle of ensuring that the information within the file (i.e., user names and passwords/hashes) has not been altered, deleted, or corrupted in an unauthorized manner. Protecting integrity means ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and trustworthy."
"What are ""dictionary attacks"" and how are they mitigated in password file protection?","""Dictionary attacks"" are a type of attack where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access by systematically trying a list of common words, phrases, and previously compromised passwords (often from ""on-line dictionaries""). In password file protection, they are mitigated by using strong hashing algorithms with high ""work factors,"" salting, and by enforcing complex ""password formats"" that make passwords less susceptible to being found in such dictionaries."
Summarise the primary goal of modern password hashing algorithms.,"The primary goal of modern password hashing algorithms is to securely store passwords by making them extremely difficult and computationally expensive for an attacker to crack, even if the hashed password database is compromised. This is achieved by being intentionally ""slow"" and configurable via a ""work factor,"" unlike fast cryptographic hashes."
"What is the role of a ""salt"" in the hashing process?","The role of a ""salt"" in the hashing process is to be a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password before it is hashed. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their resulting hashes will be different, and it significantly increases the difficulty for an attacker to crack multiple hashes simultaneously using pre-computed tables."
How does the time required for cracking hashes change with salting?,"With salting, the time required for cracking hashes grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. This is because, as the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder."
What is the implication of modern hashing algorithms automatically salting passwords?,The implication of modern hashing algorithms automatically salting passwords is that no additional steps are required by the user or developer to generate and apply a salt when using these algorithms. This simplifies the implementation of secure password storage and ensures that the critical security benefit of salting is always applied by default.
Why are crypto hashes like SHA family and KECCAK not ideal for direct password storage?,"Crypto hashes like the ""SHA family"" and ""KECCAK"" are not ideal for direct password storage because they are designed to be ""fast."" While this speed is beneficial for other cryptographic applications, it makes them vulnerable to ""brute-force attacks"" and ""dictionary attacks"" when used for passwords, as attackers can quickly compute and test many hash values. Secure password storage requires intentionally slow hashing functions."
What is the main drawback of users having difficulty memorizing complex passwords?,"The main drawback of users having difficulty memorizing complex passwords is that it often leads to insecure practices, such as writing passwords down on a piece of paper kept close to the computer. This physical record then becomes a vulnerability, potentially exposing the password to unauthorized individuals."
What is the risk associated with users re-using their favorite passwords?,"The risk associated with users re-using their favorite passwords is that if one of their accounts is compromised, an attacker can then try that same password on other services, potentially gaining access to multiple accounts. This undermines the security benefits of complex passwords and frequent changes."
What is the potential consequence if default passwords are not changed?,"The potential consequence if ""default passwords"" are not changed is that an attacker can easily break into the system. Default passwords are often publicly known or easily guessable (e.g., ""manager""), providing a straightforward entry point for unauthorized access if they remain in place after system installation."
How does prescribing a minimal password length contribute to security?,"Prescribing a minimal ""password length"" contributes to security by increasing the total number of possible password combinations. This makes ""brute-force attacks,"" where an attacker tries every possible combination, significantly more time-consuming and computationally expensive, thereby deterring or preventing such attacks."
What is the benefit of displaying the time of last login to a user?,"The benefit of displaying the time of last login to a user is to provide an immediate warning about recently attempted attacks or unauthorized access. If a user sees a last login time that does not correspond to their own activity, they are alerted to a potential security breach and can take action, such as changing their password or reporting suspicious activity."
