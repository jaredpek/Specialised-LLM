What is salting in the context of password storage?,"Salting is a security measure in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a **salt**, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. The **hashing process** transforms a password into a fixed-size string of characters, called a hash, which is difficult to reverse. This salt is unique for every user, making it significantly harder for an attacker to crack large numbers of hashes because they must crack them one at a time using the respective salt, rather than pre-computing a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, thereby increasing security."
How does salting protect against pre-computing hashes?,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes by adding a unique, randomly generated string (a **salt**) to each password before it is hashed. This prevents attackers from using **rainbow tables** or database-based lookups. A **rainbow table** is a pre-computed table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, typically for cracking password hashes. Because each password has a unique salt, even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different, making pre-computed tables ineffective for mass cracking."
What are modern hashing algorithms designed for in password storage?,"Modern hashing algorithms are specifically designed for securely storing passwords. Unlike fast cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family and KECCAK, which are designed for speed, these modern algorithms are intentionally designed to be slow. Their slowness can be configured by changing a **work factor**, which is a parameter that controls the computational cost of the hashing function, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
Which modern hashing algorithms automatically salt passwords?,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This means that no additional steps are required from the user or system administrator to incorporate salting when using these algorithms, enhancing security by default."
What is Argon2 and its significance?,"Argon2 is a modern password hashing algorithm that was the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. It is specifically designed for securely storing passwords and is known for its configurable slowness, which can be adjusted using a **work factor** to resist brute-force attacks."
When should bcrypt be used for password storage?,"The bcrypt password hashing function should be considered the second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available. Like Argon2, bcrypt is a modern hashing algorithm designed for secure password storage, featuring configurable slowness to resist cracking attempts."
What is the primary risk if no password is set for a user account?,"If there is no password set for a user account, the primary risk is that an attacker does not even have to guess it. They can simply gain unauthorized access to the account without any authentication barrier, compromising the system's security immediately."
Why is it important to change default passwords?,"It is important to change default passwords because they often have common, easily guessable values, such as ""manager,"" which are widely known. While default passwords help field engineers during system installation, if left unchanged, they create an easy entry point for an attacker to break into the system, severely compromising security."
What are the recommended characteristics for a strong password format?,"For a strong password format, it is recommended to mix upper and lower case characters (making it **case-sensitive**, meaning 'Password' is different from 'password'), include numerical symbols, and incorporate other non-alphabetical symbols (making it **alphanumeric**, which refers to characters that are either letters or numbers, plus special symbols). This combination increases the complexity and difficulty for attackers to guess or crack the password."
What is password ageing?,"Password ageing is a security policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords. Its purpose is to force users to change their passwords regularly, thereby reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password and enhancing overall system security."
How do systems limit login attempts?,"Systems limit login attempts by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain number of failed attempts occur, the system can react by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This measure is designed to prevent or discourage further brute-force attempts by attackers."
What information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to enhance security awareness?,"After a successful login, to enhance security awareness and warn the user about recently attempted attacks, the system should display the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts that have occurred since that last successful login."
What is a passphrase as an alternative form of password?,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy for them to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size password from this passphrase, providing a more user-friendly yet secure authentication method."
Explain visual drawing patterns as an alternative password method.,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative password method primarily used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on a grid of points or images, which the system then verifies."
What are picture passwords and where are they used?,"Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns to log in. This method was notably used in Windows 8, offering a more visual and potentially easier-to-remember way to authenticate than traditional text-based passwords."
What is a password file and what is the main risk associated with it?,"A password file is a file maintained by the operating system that contains user names and their corresponding passwords (often in a hashed or encrypted form). The main risk associated with this file is that an attacker could try to compromise its confidentiality or integrity, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts or the system."
What are the options for protecting a password file?,"There are several options for protecting a password file: **cryptographic protection**, which involves encrypting the file to prevent unauthorized reading; **access control**, enforced by the operating system to restrict who can read or modify the file; and a **combination** of cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
How does a salt make cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder?,"A salt makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because it is unique for every user. This forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective salt for each, rather than calculating a single hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. Consequently, the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making mass attacks computationally infeasible."
What is the impact of salting on determining if two users have the same password?,"Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because the different salts applied to identical passwords will result in different hashed values. Even if the underlying passwords are the same, their unique salts ensure that their stored hashes are distinct, preventing an attacker from identifying duplicate passwords by simply comparing hash values."
What is a 'work factor' in the context of password hashing algorithms?,"A 'work factor' is a configurable parameter in modern password hashing algorithms that determines how slow the hashing process is. By changing the work factor, the computational cost of generating a hash can be increased, making it more resource-intensive for attackers to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks, thus enhancing security."
"What are the potential difficulties users face when forced to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords?","Users may face several difficulties when forced to use such passwords: they may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, difficulty dealing with frequent password changes, and they may find ways of re-using their favorite password, which undermines the security benefits."
Why is it generally considered a bad idea for users to write down their passwords?,"It is generally considered a bad idea for users to write down their passwords because if passwords are kept on a piece of paper close to the computer, they become physically vulnerable. An attacker gaining physical access to the vicinity of the computer could easily find and use the written password, bypassing all digital security measures."
What is the purpose of prescribing a minimal password length?,"The purpose of prescribing a minimal password length is to make passwords more resistant to guessing and brute-force attacks. Longer passwords have a larger keyspace, meaning there are more possible combinations, which significantly increases the time and computational resources required for an attacker to crack them."
Why are online dictionaries relevant to password security policies?,"Online dictionaries are relevant to password security policies because today, dictionaries for almost every language exist and are readily available. Attackers can use these dictionaries in **dictionary attacks**, where they try common words and phrases as passwords. Therefore, password policies should encourage users to create passwords that are not easily found in such dictionaries."
How does preventing users from reverting to old passwords enhance security?,"Preventing users from reverting to old passwords enhances security by ensuring that even if an old password was compromised, it cannot be reused. This policy, often implemented by keeping a list of the last 'ten' passwords used, forces users to create genuinely new passwords, reducing the risk of an attacker exploiting previously exposed credentials."
What is a one-time password?,"A one-time password (OTP) is an alternative form of password that is valid for only a single login session or transaction. This enhances security by making it impossible for an attacker to reuse a captured password, even if they intercept it."
What does 'case-sensitive' mean in the context of password format?,"In the context of password format, 'case-sensitive' means that the system distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, 'Password123' would be considered a different password from 'password123'. This increases the complexity of the password and the number of possible combinations an attacker would need to guess."
What does 'alphanumeric' mean when describing password symbols?,"When describing password symbols, 'alphanumeric' refers to characters that are either letters (alphabetical) or numbers (numerical). In the context of strong password policies, it often implies including a mix of these, along with other non-alphabetical symbols, to increase password strength."
How does cryptographic protection secure a password file?,"Cryptographic protection secures a password file by encrypting its contents. This means that even if an unauthorized individual gains access to the file, they will not be able to read the sensitive information (usernames and passwords) without the correct decryption key, thus protecting its confidentiality."
How does access control protect a password file?,"Access control protects a password file by enforcing restrictions on who can read, write, or execute the file. This is typically managed by the operating system, ensuring that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions to interact with the password file, thereby preventing unauthorized access and modification."
What is the benefit of combining cryptographic protection and access control for a password file?,"The benefit of combining cryptographic protection and access control for a password file is that it creates a multi-layered defense. Access control prevents unauthorized direct access, while cryptographic protection ensures that even if access control is bypassed, the data remains unreadable without decryption. This combination, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks, significantly enhances the security of the password file."
Why are modern hashing algorithms designed to be slow?,"Modern hashing algorithms are designed to be slow specifically for password storage to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes that prioritize speed, the intentional slowness of password hashing algorithms, configurable via a **work factor**, increases the effort required to test many password guesses, thus enhancing security."
What is the difference between modern password hashing algorithms and crypto hashes like SHA family?,"The primary difference is their design goal: modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks, often incorporating a **work factor** to configure their slowness. In contrast, crypto hashes like the SHA family and KECCAK are designed to be fast and efficient for general-purpose cryptographic operations, not for password storage, making them less suitable for protecting passwords against dedicated attackers."
What is the role of a salt in the hashing process?,"The role of a salt in the hashing process is to be a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password before it is hashed. This ensures that even identical passwords produce different hash values, making it significantly harder for attackers to use pre-computed tables or identify duplicate passwords across users."
How does salting make it harder for an attacker to crack hashes one at a time?,"Salting makes it harder for an attacker to crack hashes one at a time because each user's password is combined with a unique salt before hashing. This means an attacker cannot simply calculate a hash once for a common password and compare it against all stored hashes. Instead, for each potential password guess, they must combine it with the specific salt associated with the target user's hash and then compute a new hash for comparison, dramatically increasing the computational effort."
What is the implication of the time required for cracking hashes growing in direct proportion to the number of hashes when salting is used?,"The implication is that salting significantly increases the cost and time for an attacker to crack a large number of passwords. Because each hash must be cracked individually with its unique salt, the attacker cannot parallelize the effort efficiently across multiple users. This makes large-scale cracking campaigns economically unfeasible and provides a strong deterrent against attackers."
Can a system determine if two users have the same password if salting is used?,"No, a system cannot determine whether two users have the same password if salting is used without cracking the hashes. This is because the different salts applied to each password, even if the passwords themselves are identical, will result in distinct hashed values. Therefore, simply comparing the stored hashes will not reveal if the underlying passwords are the same."
What is the main advantage of modern hashing algorithms automatically salting passwords?,"The main advantage of modern hashing algorithms automatically salting passwords is that it simplifies secure password storage. It removes the need for additional manual steps or configurations to implement salting, ensuring that this critical security measure is applied by default, thereby reducing the chance of misconfiguration or oversight."
What is the purpose of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,"The purpose of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition was to identify and promote the best password hashing algorithms that offer superior security against various types of attacks, particularly brute-force and dictionary attacks. Argon2 was the winner of this competition, indicating its strong security properties."
"What is the risk of users re-using their favorite password, even with complex password policies?","The risk of users re-using their favorite password, even with complex password policies, is that if that single favorite password is ever compromised (e.g., through a data breach on another service), an attacker can then use it to gain access to multiple accounts where the user has reused it. This undermines the security benefits of complex password requirements."
What is the consequence of leaving default passwords unchanged for system accounts?,"The consequence of leaving default passwords unchanged for system accounts is that it makes it easy for an attacker to break into the system. Default passwords, like ""manager,"" are often publicly known or easily guessable, providing a straightforward entry point for unauthorized access if not changed."
How can a system prevent users from reverting to old passwords?,"A system can prevent users from reverting to old passwords by maintaining a history of previously used passwords. For example, it might keep a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used and disallow users from setting any password that appears on this list when they change their password."
What is the primary goal of limiting login attempts?,"The primary goal of limiting login attempts is to prevent or discourage brute-force attacks and other automated attempts to guess passwords. By locking an account after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, the system significantly slows down or stops an attacker's ability to try many different passwords."
Why is it beneficial to inform the user about recent failed login attempts?,"It is beneficial to inform the user about recent failed login attempts because it serves as an early warning system. By displaying the number of failed attempts since their last successful login, the user is alerted to potential unauthorized access attempts on their account, prompting them to take action, such as changing their password or reporting suspicious activity."
How does a system compute the actual password from a passphrase?,"When a user enters a passphrase, the system applies a **hash function** to it. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (the passphrase) into a fixed-size string of characters (the actual password or its hash representation). This process ensures that the system stores a secure, fixed-size representation rather than the passphrase itself."
What type of interface is typically associated with visual drawing patterns for passwords?,"Visual drawing patterns for passwords are typically associated with touch interfaces. This method relies on users interacting directly with a screen by drawing a specific pattern, making it suitable for devices like smartphones and tablets, such as those running Android."
What is the purpose of additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks when protecting a password file?,"The purpose of additional measures to slow down dictionary attacks, when protecting a password file, is to increase the computational cost and time required for an attacker to test common words and phrases. These measures, often combined with cryptographic protection and access control, make it impractical for attackers to succeed with dictionary attacks within a reasonable timeframe."
What is the main function of the operating system regarding user names and passwords?,The main function of the operating system regarding user names and passwords is to maintain a **password file**. This file stores the user names and their corresponding passwords (typically in a hashed or encrypted format) to facilitate user authentication and manage access to system resources.
How does salting make the hashing process more secure?,"Salting makes the hashing process more secure by introducing a unique, random string (the **salt**) to each password before it is hashed. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their resulting hash values will be different, preventing attackers from using pre-computed tables like rainbow tables and forcing them to crack each password individually."
What is the primary characteristic of passwords designed for secure storage?,"The primary characteristic of passwords designed for secure storage, particularly when using modern hashing algorithms, is that they should be slow to compute. This intentional slowness, configurable via a **work factor**, makes it computationally intensive for attackers to perform brute-force attacks, thereby enhancing security."
Why is it important to mix upper and lower case characters in a password?,"It is important to mix upper and lower case characters in a password because it makes the password **case-sensitive**. This significantly increases the number of possible character combinations, expanding the password's keyspace and making it much harder for attackers to guess or crack through brute-force methods."
What is the risk of an attacker compromising the confidentiality of a password file?,"The risk of an attacker compromising the confidentiality of a password file is that they could gain unauthorized access to the stored usernames and passwords. If these passwords are not properly hashed or encrypted, the attacker could directly obtain plain-text passwords, leading to widespread account compromise and system breaches."
What is the risk of an attacker compromising the integrity of a password file?,"The risk of an attacker compromising the integrity of a password file is that they could modify the stored usernames and passwords. This could allow them to change existing passwords, create new user accounts, or alter authentication credentials, thereby gaining unauthorized control over user accounts and the system."
How do default passwords assist field engineers?,"Default passwords assist field engineers by providing a known, pre-set credential for system accounts, such as ""manager,"" during the initial installation and setup of a system. This allows engineers to easily access and configure the system without needing to create new passwords immediately."
What is the main purpose of password policies?,"The main purpose of password policies is to enforce rules and guidelines for password creation, management, and usage to enhance the security of user accounts and systems. These policies aim to prevent unauthorized access by making passwords difficult to guess or crack and by managing their lifecycle."
List four alternative forms of passwords mentioned in the document.,"Four alternative forms of passwords mentioned in the document are: **Passphrases**, where users enter sentences or long phrases; **Visual drawing patterns**, used on touch interfaces like Android; **Picture passwords**, where users select objects in pictures, as seen in Windows 8; and **One-time passwords**, which are valid for a single use."
What is the primary benefit of using a passphrase over a traditional password?,"The primary benefit of using a passphrase over a traditional password is that it allows users to enter sentences or long phrases that are easy for them to remember, while still providing a high level of security. The system applies a hash function to compute a fixed-size actual password, combining user-friendliness with cryptographic strength."
