Provide a comprehensive summary of salting in password storage.,"Salting is a security measure in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a **salt**, is added to each password before it undergoes the hashing process. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt for each user, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Explain how salting protects against pre-computed hash attacks.,"Salting protects against pre-computed hash attacks, such as those using **rainbow tables** or database-based lookups, by ensuring that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to the unique salt applied to each. A **rainbow table** is a pre-computed table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, typically for cracking passwords. Since each password has a unique salt, an attacker cannot pre-compute hashes for common passwords and then quickly look up the corresponding plaintext password."
Summarise the impact of salting on determining if two users share the same password.,"Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the individual hashes. This is because a unique salt is added to each password before hashing. Consequently, even if two users choose identical passwords, the different salts applied to them will result in distinct stored hashes, preventing an attacker from easily identifying shared passwords."
Can you summarise the key considerations behind modern password hashing algorithms?,"Modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed for securely storing passwords by being intentionally slow, unlike fast cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family or KECCAK. Their slowness can be configured by changing a **work factor**, which increases the computational effort required to compute a hash. This design makes brute-force attacks more time-consuming and resource-intensive for attackers."
"What is the purpose of the ""work factor"" in modern password hashing algorithms?","The **work factor** in modern password hashing algorithms is a configurable parameter that determines how slow the hashing process is. By changing the work factor, the computational effort required to compute a hash can be increased or decreased. A higher work factor makes the hashing process slower, which in turn makes brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker, thereby enhancing security."
Which hashing algorithms are recommended for password storage and why?,"**Argon2** is recommended as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. If Argon2 is not available, **bcrypt** should be the second choice for password storage. These algorithms are preferred because they are modern hashing algorithms specifically designed to be slow and resistant to various attacks, unlike faster cryptographic hashes."
Explain the primary difference between modern password hashing algorithms and crypto hashes like SHA family.,"The primary difference lies in their design goals: modern password hashing algorithms like Argon2 and bcrypt are specifically designed to be **slow** and resource-intensive to compute, making brute-force password cracking difficult. In contrast, **crypto hashes** such as the SHA family (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3) and KECCAK are designed to be **fast** for general-purpose data integrity and cryptographic operations, which makes them unsuitable for direct password storage as they would allow attackers to test many passwords quickly."
Summarise the challenges associated with enforcing complex password policies.,"Enforcing complex password policies, such as requiring long, mixed-case, numerical, and symbolic passwords that are system-generated and frequently changed, presents several challenges. Users may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, struggle with frequent password changes, and might find ways to re-use their favorite passwords. Additionally, users might resort to writing down their passwords on physical paper, often kept close to their computer, which introduces a physical security vulnerability."
Is it always a bad idea to write down your password?,"The document implies that writing down passwords, especially when users are forced to use complex ones, is a common user behavior that can lead to security vulnerabilities. If passwords are written on a piece of paper and kept close to the computer, it creates a physical security risk, making it easier for an attacker with physical access to compromise the account. Therefore, it is generally considered a bad idea from a security standpoint."
What is the fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account?,"The fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account is to prevent unauthorized access. If no password is set, an attacker does not even have to guess it, gaining immediate access to the account and its associated resources, thereby compromising the system's security."
Can you summarise the key considerations for changing default passwords?,"Changing default passwords is a critical security measure because system accounts often come with easily guessable default values, such as ""manager"". While these default passwords assist field engineers during system installation, leaving them unchanged creates an easy entry point for attackers to break into the system. Therefore, changing them immediately after installation is essential to prevent unauthorized access."
Summarise the key considerations for avoiding guessable passwords.,"To avoid guessable passwords, it is crucial to prescribe a minimal **password length** and enforce a specific **password format**. The password format should require a mix of upper and lower case characters (which are **case-sensitive**), include numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols (making them **alphanumeric**). This is important because online dictionaries for almost every language exist today, which attackers can use in dictionary attacks to guess common or simple passwords."
"Define ""password length"" and ""password format"" in the context of password policies.","**Password length** refers to the minimum number of characters required for a password. Prescribing a minimal length makes passwords harder to guess. **Password format** refers to the rules governing the types of characters that must be included in a password, such as a mix of upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols. This ensures complexity and reduces guessability."
"What does ""case-sensitive"" mean in the context of password security?","In the context of password security, **case-sensitive** means that the system distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, ""Password123"" would be considered different from ""password123"". This requirement increases the complexity and possible combinations of a password, making it harder for attackers to guess."
"What are ""alphanumeric"" symbols in password policies?","**Alphanumeric** symbols in password policies refer to characters that include both alphabetical letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerical digits (0-9). When password policies require alphanumeric symbols, it means passwords must contain a combination of these character types, often alongside other non-alphabetical symbols, to enhance their strength and resistance to guessing."
How do online dictionaries pose a threat to password security?,"Online dictionaries pose a significant threat to password security because they contain vast lists of common words and phrases in almost every language. Attackers can use these dictionaries in **dictionary attacks**, where they systematically try every word in the dictionary as a password. If users choose simple, dictionary-based passwords, they are highly vulnerable to such attacks."
What is password ageing and its purpose?,**Password ageing** is a password policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords. Its primary purpose is to force users to change their passwords regularly. This practice helps to mitigate the risk of compromised passwords being used indefinitely and reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker who might have obtained an old password.
Why is it important to prevent users from reverting to old passwords?,"It is important to prevent users from reverting to old passwords, for example, by keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used, to enhance security. If users are allowed to reuse old passwords, especially those that might have been previously compromised or are easily guessable, it negates the security benefits of password ageing and makes accounts vulnerable to re-compromise."
How does limiting login attempts enhance password security?,"Limiting login attempts enhances password security by preventing or discouraging brute-force attacks. The system monitors unsuccessful login attempts and can react by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This mechanism significantly slows down attackers who try to guess passwords by repeatedly entering different combinations, making such attacks impractical."
Why is it important to inform users about recent login activity?,"It is important to inform users about recent login activity to warn them about recently attempted attacks. After a successful login, displaying the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since then allows users to identify suspicious activity. If a user sees an unfamiliar login time or a high number of failed attempts, they can take immediate action, such as changing their password, to protect their account."
"Describe ""Passphrase"" as an alternative form of password.","A **passphrase** is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are typically easier to remember than complex, random character strings. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual, fixed-size password from this passphrase. This method aims to combine memorability for the user with strong cryptographic security."
"Explain ""Visual drawing patterns"" as an alternative form of password.","**Visual drawing patterns** are an alternative form of password primarily used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern or sequence on a grid of points or images. This method leverages spatial memory and touch interaction for authentication."
"Describe ""Picture passwords"" as an alternative form of password.","**Picture passwords** are an alternative form of password where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns for authentication. This method was used in Windows 8. Instead of typing characters, users interact with an image by tapping or clicking on predefined areas or objects in a specific order."
"What are ""One-time passwords""?","**One-time passwords** are an alternative form of password that is valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short period. This method significantly enhances security by making replay attacks impossible, as a compromised one-time password cannot be used again."
What is the role of the operating system in managing user passwords?,"The operating system plays a crucial role in managing user passwords by maintaining a file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. This **password file** is a critical component of system security, as it stores the credentials necessary for user authentication."
What are the potential threats to a password file?,"The potential threats to a password file primarily involve an attacker trying to compromise its **confidentiality** or **integrity**. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the password data itself, potentially revealing user passwords (or their hashes). Compromising integrity means altering the password data, which could lead to unauthorized account access or denial of service."
Summarise the options for protecting the password file.,"There are several options for protecting the password file:\n1.  **Cryptographic protection:** Encrypting the password file to prevent unauthorized reading.\n2.  **Access control enforced by the operating system:** Implementing permissions and restrictions to limit who can access or modify the file.\n3.  **Combination of cryptographic protection and access control:** Using both encryption and access controls for a layered defense, possibly with further measures to slow down **dictionary attacks**."
"Define ""cryptographic protection"" in the context of password file security.","In the context of password file security, **cryptographic protection** refers to the use of encryption techniques to secure the password file. This means that the data within the file is transformed into an unreadable format, making it unintelligible to unauthorized individuals even if they gain access to the file. Only those with the correct decryption key can revert the data to its original, readable form."
"Explain ""access control enforced by the operating system"" for password file protection.","**Access control enforced by the operating system** for password file protection involves setting permissions and restrictions on who can read, write, or execute the password file. The operating system's security mechanisms ensure that only authorized users or processes (e.g., system administrators, specific system services) can interact with the file, thereby preventing unauthorized access or modification by other users or malicious software."
How can a combination of cryptographic protection and access control enhance password file security?,"A combination of **cryptographic protection** and **access control** significantly enhances password file security by providing a layered defense. Access control limits who can even reach the file, while cryptographic protection ensures that even if an attacker bypasses access controls and obtains the file, the data within it remains unreadable without the decryption key. This dual approach makes it much harder for an attacker to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. This combination can also include further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
What are dictionary attacks and how can they be mitigated in the context of password file protection?,"**Dictionary attacks** are a type of brute-force attack where an attacker attempts to guess passwords by trying every word in a dictionary or a list of common passwords. In the context of password file protection, these attacks can be mitigated by combining cryptographic protection and access control, along with further measures specifically designed to slow them down. Such measures often involve making the process of checking each password guess computationally expensive, for example, by using slow hashing algorithms and salting."
What is the primary benefit of salting in preventing password reuse detection?,"The primary benefit of salting in preventing password reuse detection is that it makes it impossible to determine if two users have the same password without cracking the individual hashes. Since a unique, randomly generated salt is added to each password before hashing, identical passwords will produce different hashes, thus obscuring any patterns of password reuse."
Which modern hashing algorithms automatically incorporate salting?,"Modern hashing algorithms such as **Argon2id**, **bcrypt**, and **PBKDF2** automatically salt the passwords. This means that when these algorithms are used, no additional steps are required by the developer or system administrator to generate and apply a unique salt to each password, simplifying secure password storage implementation."
Why are modern password hashing algorithms designed to be slow?,"Modern password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow to make brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers. By requiring significant processing power and time for each password guess, these algorithms increase the cost and difficulty for an attacker to crack a large number of passwords, thereby enhancing security."
What was the significance of Argon2 winning the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,"Argon2 winning the 2015 Password Hashing Competition signifies its recognition as the most secure and robust algorithm for password hashing at that time. This competition evaluated various algorithms based on their resistance to different types of attacks, including brute-force, dictionary, and side-channel attacks, establishing Argon2 as a leading standard for secure password storage."
When should bcrypt be used for password storage?,"**bcrypt** should be used for password storage as the second choice if **Argon2** is not available. This recommendation is based on bcrypt's strong security properties, including its design to be slow and its ability to incorporate a work factor, making it resistant to brute-force attacks, similar to Argon2."
What are the user difficulties associated with memorizing complex passwords?,"Users may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, especially when they are long, mix upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, and are system-generated. This difficulty can lead to users writing down passwords, reusing simpler passwords, or struggling with frequent password changes, all of which can undermine security."
How do frequent password changes impact users?,"Frequent password changes can negatively impact users by making it difficult for them to deal with the constant need to remember new, complex passwords. This can lead to frustration, users choosing simpler or easily guessable passwords, or even writing them down, which can inadvertently reduce overall security."
What is the risk of users re-using their favorite password?,"The risk of users re-using their favorite password is that if that password is ever compromised in one system, an attacker can then use it to gain unauthorized access to other systems where the user has reused the same password. This practice significantly expands the impact of a single password breach across multiple accounts."
What is the primary purpose of setting expiry dates for passwords?,"The primary purpose of setting expiry dates for passwords is to force users to change their passwords regularly. This practice ensures that even if a password is compromised, its validity period is limited, reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit the compromised credential."
How does locking a user account after unsuccessful login attempts improve security?,"Locking a user account after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts improves security by preventing or significantly slowing down brute-force attacks. This mechanism makes it impractical for attackers to systematically guess passwords, as their attempts are quickly thwarted by the account lockout, which can be temporary or permanent."
What information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to enhance security awareness?,"After a successful login, to enhance security awareness and warn the user about recently attempted attacks, the system should display the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This allows the user to quickly identify any suspicious activity on their account."
What are the characteristics of a strong password format according to password policies?,"According to password policies, a strong password format should include a mix of upper and lower case characters (which are case-sensitive), numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols (making it alphanumeric). This combination increases the complexity and entropy of the password, making it significantly harder to guess or crack."
Why is it important to prescribe a minimal password length?,"It is important to prescribe a minimal password length because longer passwords inherently have more possible combinations, making them exponentially harder for attackers to guess through brute-force methods. A longer length increases the time and computational resources required for an attacker to crack the password."
How do default passwords pose a security risk?,"Default passwords pose a significant security risk because they are often common, easily guessable values (e.g., ""manager"") that are widely known or can be easily found. If left unchanged, these passwords provide an easy entry point for attackers to gain unauthorized access to system accounts, compromising the entire system."
What is the benefit of using visual drawing patterns for authentication?,"The benefit of using visual drawing patterns for authentication, particularly on touch interfaces, is that it offers an alternative to traditional text-based passwords that can be easier for users to remember and input on touchscreens. It leverages spatial memory and a different modality for authentication, potentially improving user experience while maintaining a level of security."
How do picture passwords work in Windows 8?,"In Windows 8, picture passwords work by allowing users to select specific objects in pictures and patterns as their authentication method. Instead of typing a password, the user interacts with a chosen image by performing a series of taps, circles, or lines on designated areas of the picture in a specific sequence."
What is the primary security advantage of one-time passwords?,"The primary security advantage of one-time passwords is that they are valid for only a single login session or transaction. This means that even if an attacker intercepts a one-time password, it cannot be reused for subsequent access, effectively preventing replay attacks and significantly enhancing security against credential theft."
"What does ""compromising the confidentiality"" of a password file mean?","""Compromising the confidentiality"" of a password file means that unauthorized individuals gain access to and can read the sensitive information contained within it, such as user names and password hashes. This breach allows attackers to potentially extract or crack passwords, leading to unauthorized account access."
"What does ""compromising the integrity"" of a password file mean?","""Compromising the integrity"" of a password file means that unauthorized individuals are able to alter, modify, or delete the data within the file. This could involve changing user passwords, adding new unauthorized users, or corrupting the file to cause denial of service, thereby undermining the system's authentication mechanisms."
