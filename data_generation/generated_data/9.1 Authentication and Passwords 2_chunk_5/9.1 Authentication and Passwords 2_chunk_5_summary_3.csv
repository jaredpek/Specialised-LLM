Provide a comprehensive summary of salting in password storage.,"Salting is a crucial security measure in password storage. A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. Because the salt is unique for every user, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This significantly increases the difficulty of cracking large numbers of hashes, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. Salting also protects against pre-computation attacks using rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Furthermore, salting makes it impossible to determine if two users share the same password without cracking the hashes, as different salts will produce different hashes even if the original passwords are identical. Modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically incorporate salting, eliminating the need for additional steps."
Explain how salting enhances password security against common attacks.,"Salting enhances password security by making it significantly harder for attackers to crack hashes and preventing certain types of pre-computation attacks. A salt, which is a unique, randomly generated string, is added to each password before hashing. This uniqueness per user forces an attacker to crack hashes individually, using the specific salt associated with each user's password, rather than performing a single hash calculation and comparing it against a large number of stored hashes. This direct proportionality between cracking time and the number of hashes makes large-scale cracking much more resource-intensive. Salting also provides protection against rainbow tables and database-based lookups, which are pre-computed tables of hashes used to quickly reverse passwords. By ensuring different salts result in different hashes, even for identical passwords, salting prevents an attacker from easily identifying users with the same password."
What is a 'salt' in the context of password storage and why is it unique for every user?,"In the context of password storage, a 'salt' is a unique, randomly generated string that is appended to each password before it undergoes the hashing process. It is unique for every user to significantly bolster security. If salts were not unique, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords and use them against multiple users, or use rainbow tables effectively. By making each salt unique, an attacker is forced to crack each password hash individually, using its specific salt, which drastically increases the time and computational resources required to compromise multiple accounts. This uniqueness ensures that even if two users have the exact same password, their stored hashes will be different due to the distinct salts, making it impossible to determine password commonality without cracking each hash."
Summarise the benefits of salting passwords.,"Salting passwords offers several key benefits for enhancing security. Firstly, it makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because a unique, randomly generated string (the 'salt') is added to each password before hashing. This forces attackers to crack hashes one at a time, with the time required growing proportionally to the number of hashes. Secondly, salting protects against pre-computation attacks, such as those using rainbow tables or database-based lookups, by ensuring that pre-computed hashes are not universally applicable. Thirdly, salting prevents an attacker from determining if two users share the same password without cracking the hashes, as different salts will produce different hash values even if the original passwords are identical."
How do modern hashing algorithms handle salting?,"Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, automatically handle salting as an integral part of their process. This means that when these algorithms are used for password storage, no additional steps are required by the developer or system administrator to generate and apply a unique salt to each password. The algorithm itself incorporates a unique, randomly generated string (the 'salt') into the hashing process for every user, ensuring that the security benefits of salting are inherently provided without manual intervention."
What are the key characteristics of modern password hashing algorithms?,"Modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed for securely storing passwords and possess key characteristics that differentiate them from general-purpose cryptographic hashes. Primarily, they are designed to be slow, unlike fast cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family or KECCAK. This intentional slowness makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming. The degree of slowness can often be configured by adjusting a 'work factor', allowing administrators to balance security with performance. Examples of such algorithms include Argon2, which won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, and bcrypt, which is recommended as a second choice if Argon2 is unavailable."
Explain the concept of 'work factor' in password hashing algorithms.,"The 'work factor' in password hashing algorithms refers to a configurable parameter that determines how computationally intensive and, consequently, how slow the hashing process will be. Modern password hashing algorithms are intentionally designed to be slow to deter brute-force attacks. By changing the work factor, system administrators can adjust the time and resources required to compute a hash. A higher work factor means more computational effort is expended, making it harder and slower for an attacker to crack passwords, but also increasing the time for legitimate password verification. This allows for a balance between security strength and system performance."
Which password hashing algorithm won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition and what is the recommended alternative?,"Argon2 is the password hashing algorithm that won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. If Argon2 is not available or cannot be implemented, the bcrypt password hashing function is recommended as the second choice for password storage. Both algorithms are examples of modern hashing algorithms specifically designed to be slow and secure for password storage, incorporating features like salting and a configurable work factor."
Compare modern password hashing algorithms with traditional crypto hashes like SHA family.,"Modern password hashing algorithms, such as Argon2 and bcrypt, differ fundamentally from traditional cryptographic hashes like the SHA family (e.g., SHA-256) or KECCAK in their design goals. Traditional crypto hashes are designed to be fast and efficient for data integrity checks and digital signatures. In contrast, modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed to be slow. This intentional slowness, often configurable via a 'work factor', makes brute-force attacks against stored passwords computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers. Additionally, modern password hashing algorithms automatically incorporate salting, which further enhances security by making pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables ineffective and ensuring unique hashes for identical passwords across different users."
What is the primary design principle behind modern password hashing algorithms?,"The primary design principle behind modern password hashing algorithms is to be slow. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes that are designed for speed, algorithms like Argon2 and bcrypt are intentionally engineered to require significant computational resources and time to compute a hash. This slowness is a security feature, as it makes brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks against stored password hashes prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for an attacker, thereby increasing the security of user passwords."
Summarise the challenges associated with enforcing highly complex and frequently changed passwords.,"Enforcing highly complex passwords, such as those that are long, mix upper and lower case characters, include numerical symbols, are system-generated, and require frequent changes, presents several challenges for users and overall security. Firstly, users may have significant difficulty memorizing such complex passwords, leading to frustration. Secondly, users may struggle to deal with frequent password changes, which can lead to them choosing simpler, more predictable passwords or finding ways to circumvent the policy. Thirdly, users might resort to re-using their favorite passwords across different systems or finding ways to record them. A common consequence of these difficulties is that users may write down their passwords on a piece of paper, often kept close to their computer, which introduces a physical security vulnerability."
"Why might forcing users to use system-generated, complex passwords not always lead to the highest security?","Forcing users to use system-generated, complex passwords, especially when combined with requirements for frequent changes, may not always lead to the highest security due to human factors. Users often have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, which can lead to them writing down the password on a physical note kept near their computer, thereby creating a new security risk. Additionally, the burden of frequent changes can cause users to become frustrated and find ways to re-use their favorite, potentially less secure, passwords or choose easily guessable patterns to cope with the policy, ultimately undermining the intended security benefits."
What are the potential risks if users struggle to remember complex passwords?,"If users struggle to remember complex passwords, several potential risks emerge. The most common risk is that users may resort to writing down their passwords on a piece of paper or other physical medium, often keeping it in an easily accessible location near their computer. This creates a significant physical security vulnerability, as an attacker gaining physical access to the user's workspace could easily discover the password. Additionally, the frustration of memorizing complex passwords can lead to users choosing simpler, less secure passwords when given the option, or attempting to re-use a limited set of favorite passwords across multiple services, which increases the risk of credential stuffing attacks if one service is compromised."
Is it always a bad idea to write down your password? Explain the context.,"The document implies that writing down a password, especially when kept close to the computer, is generally a bad idea because it creates a physical security vulnerability. This often happens when users are forced to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords that are difficult to memorize. While the document doesn't explicitly state 'always,' it highlights the negative consequence: 'Passwords will be written on a piece of paper kept close to the computer,' indicating that this practice undermines the security intended by complex password policies by making the password physically discoverable."
What are the user-related challenges of frequent password changes?,"Frequent password changes, while seemingly a good security practice, introduce several user-related challenges. Users may have difficulty dealing with the constant need to create and remember new passwords. This can lead to frustration and a tendency for users to find ways of re-using their favorite passwords, perhaps by making minor, predictable modifications, or by writing them down. Ultimately, these behaviors can undermine the security benefits intended by the frequent change policy, potentially leading to less secure password practices overall."
Summarise the importance of setting a password for user accounts.,"Setting a password for user accounts is a fundamental security measure. Its importance lies in the fact that if no password is set for a user account, an attacker does not even have to guess it. This means the account is completely unprotected and can be accessed by anyone without any authentication, making it an immediate and severe security vulnerability. Therefore, establishing a password is the first line of defense against unauthorized access."
Why is it critical to change default passwords on system accounts?,"It is critical to change default passwords on system accounts because these often have well-known, common values, such as 'manager'. While default passwords are useful for field engineers during system installation, if left unchanged, they become an easy entry point for attackers. An attacker can simply try these known default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the system, bypassing any other security measures. Therefore, changing default passwords immediately after installation is a vital step to prevent easy breaches."
What are the key recommendations for avoiding guessable passwords?,"To avoid guessable passwords, several key recommendations should be followed. Firstly, prescribe a minimal password length to increase the number of possible combinations. Secondly, enforce a specific password format that requires a mix of upper and lower case characters (making it case-sensitive), and the inclusion of numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric). This increases the complexity and entropy of the password. Thirdly, be aware that today, online dictionaries exist for almost every language, which attackers can use in dictionary attacks. Therefore, passwords should not be easily found in such dictionaries."
Define 'case-sensitive' and 'alphanumeric' in the context of password format.,"In the context of password format, 'case-sensitive' means that the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters matters. For example, 'Password123' would be considered different from 'password123'. 'Alphanumeric' refers to characters that include both alphabetical letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerical digits (0-9). When a password policy requires alphanumeric characters, it means the password must contain a combination of these types of characters, often alongside other non-alphabetical symbols to enhance complexity."
What is the risk associated with not changing default passwords?,"The risk associated with not changing default passwords is that system accounts often come with easily predictable default values, such as 'manager'. If these are left unchanged, an attacker can exploit this knowledge to easily break into the system. Default passwords, while convenient for initial setup by field engineers, become a severe security vulnerability once the system is deployed, as they provide a straightforward path for unauthorized access without needing to guess or crack complex credentials."
How do online dictionaries impact password security and what does this imply for password policies?,"Online dictionaries significantly impact password security because they provide attackers with vast lists of common words and phrases that can be used in dictionary attacks. Since these dictionaries exist for almost every language, passwords that are simple words or common phrases are highly vulnerable. This implies that password policies must enforce formats that go beyond simple dictionary words, requiring a mix of upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric) to create passwords that are not easily found in such dictionaries and thus resist dictionary attacks."
What is the fundamental reason for setting a password on a user account?,"The fundamental reason for setting a password on a user account is to establish a barrier against unauthorized access. If no password is set, an attacker faces no obstacle and does not even have to guess credentials to gain entry, leaving the account completely exposed. A password acts as the primary authentication mechanism, ensuring that only authorized individuals who know the correct password can access the account."
Discuss the dilemma of default passwords for system installation versus security.,"Default passwords present a dilemma between ease of system installation and security. They are often provided for system accounts (e.g., 'manager') to facilitate initial setup by field engineers. This convenience allows for straightforward installation and configuration. However, if these default passwords are not changed immediately after installation, they become a significant security vulnerability. Attackers are aware of common default passwords and can easily use them to gain unauthorized access, bypassing security measures. Therefore, while useful for initial setup, their continued presence poses a severe risk, raising the question of whether it would be better to do without default passwords entirely or enforce immediate changes."
Explain the concept of 'password ageing' and its two main components.,"Password ageing refers to policies designed to manage the lifespan and reuse of passwords to enhance security. It typically involves two main components. Firstly, setting expiry dates for passwords forces users to change their passwords regularly, preventing a single compromised password from being used indefinitely. Secondly, it includes measures to prevent users from reverting to old passwords, such as keeping a list of the last 'ten' passwords used and disallowing their reuse. This ensures that users create genuinely new passwords rather than cycling through a small set of familiar ones, which would undermine the purpose of regular changes."
What is the purpose of limiting login attempts?,"The purpose of limiting login attempts is to prevent or discourage brute-force attacks and other automated attempts to guess passwords. The system monitors unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain threshold of failed attempts is reached, the system can react by locking the user account, either completely or for a specified time interval. This mechanism significantly slows down attackers, making it much harder for them to systematically try numerous password combinations and protecting accounts from being compromised through repeated guessing."
How does informing the user about login activity contribute to password security?,"Informing the user about login activity contributes to password security by empowering them to detect and react to potential unauthorized access. After a successful login, the system can display the time of the last successful login and the number of failed login attempts since that time. This information serves as a warning to the user about recently attempted attacks. If a user sees unusual activity, such as a login from an unfamiliar time or numerous failed attempts, they can take immediate action, such as changing their password or reporting suspicious activity, thereby enhancing the overall security posture."
What measures are included in password ageing policies to prevent password reuse?,"Password ageing policies include measures to prevent password reuse, specifically by keeping a list of previously used passwords and disallowing users from reverting to them. For example, a policy might prevent a user from reusing any of their last 'ten' passwords. This component is crucial because simply forcing regular password changes without preventing reuse would allow users to cycle through a small set of familiar passwords, negating the security benefits of the change requirement."
Describe the system's reaction to unsuccessful login attempts when a limit is in place.,"When a limit on login attempts is in place, the system monitors unsuccessful login attempts. Upon detecting a predefined number of failed attempts, the system reacts by locking the user account. This lock can be either complete, requiring administrative intervention to unlock, or for a given time interval, after which the user can attempt to log in again. This reaction is designed to prevent or discourage further attempts by an attacker, making brute-force attacks impractical by significantly slowing down or stopping the guessing process."
Why is it important to display the time of last login to a user?,"It is important to display the time of last login to a user after a successful login because it serves as a critical security alert. By showing the user when their account was last accessed, they can quickly identify any unauthorized activity. If the displayed time does not match their own login history, it indicates a potential compromise or an attempted breach, prompting the user to take immediate action, such as changing their password or contacting support, thus enhancing their account's security."
What is the primary goal of setting expiry dates for passwords?,"The primary goal of setting expiry dates for passwords is to force users to change their passwords regularly. This practice aims to mitigate the risk associated with a compromised password. If a password is stolen or guessed, its utility to an attacker is limited by its expiration date. Regular changes reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password, thereby enhancing overall account security."
How does limiting login attempts protect against brute-force attacks?,"Limiting login attempts protects against brute-force attacks by making them impractical and time-consuming. A brute-force attack involves an attacker systematically trying numerous password combinations until the correct one is found. By monitoring unsuccessful login attempts and locking the user account (either completely or for a time interval) after a certain number of failures, the system significantly slows down or halts the attacker's progress. This dramatically increases the time and resources required for a successful attack, often making it infeasible."
What information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to warn about attacks?,"After a successful login, to warn the user about recently attempted attacks, the system should display two key pieces of information: the time of their last successful login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This allows the user to quickly identify any suspicious activity, such as logins from unexpected times or a high number of failed attempts, indicating potential unauthorized access attempts."
Describe a 'passphrase' as an alternative form of password.,"A 'passphrase' is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are typically easier to remember than complex, random strings. Instead of directly using the phrase as the password, the system applies a hash function to compute a fixed-size actual password from the passphrase. This combines the user-friendliness of memorable phrases with the security benefits of a hashed, fixed-size credential."
What are 'visual drawing patterns' and where are they commonly used?,"'Visual drawing patterns' are an alternative form of password that involves a user drawing a specific pattern on a touch interface. This method is commonly used in mobile operating systems, such as Android, where users connect a series of dots or points in a particular sequence to unlock their device. It leverages spatial memory and touch interaction for authentication."
Explain 'picture passwords' and provide an example of their usage.,"'Picture passwords' are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects or patterns within a chosen picture. Instead of typing a string of characters, the user interacts with an image by tapping or clicking on predefined areas or drawing gestures. An example of their usage is in Windows 8, where users could set a picture password by drawing shapes or tapping on specific points on an image."
What is a 'one-time password'?,"A 'one-time password' (OTP) is an alternative form of password that is valid for only a single login session or transaction. It is typically generated by an algorithm or a hardware token and expires after a short period or once used. This enhances security by ensuring that even if an OTP is intercepted, it cannot be reused for subsequent unauthorized access."
Compare passphrases with traditional complex passwords in terms of memorability and security.,"Passphrases offer an advantage over traditional complex passwords in terms of memorability because they consist of sentences or long phrases that are generally easier for users to recall. While traditional complex passwords rely on a mix of seemingly random characters, numbers, and symbols, passphrases leverage natural language. In terms of security, passphrases can be very strong if they are sufficiently long and unique, as the system applies a hash function to compute a fixed-size actual password. This allows for a balance where users can remember their credentials more easily, while the underlying system still stores a secure, hashed representation."
Which alternative password forms are suitable for touch interfaces?,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative password form specifically suitable for touch interfaces. These patterns involve users drawing a specific sequence or shape on a screen by connecting points, which is a natural interaction method for touch-enabled devices like smartphones and tablets. Picture passwords, which involve selecting objects or patterns in pictures, can also be implemented effectively on touch interfaces."
What is the role of the operating system regarding the password file?,"The operating system maintains a file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. This 'password file' is a critical component for user authentication and system security. Its confidentiality and integrity are paramount, as an attacker would attempt to compromise this file to gain unauthorized access to user accounts."
What are the primary options for protecting the password file?,"There are three primary options for protecting the password file. Firstly, cryptographic protection involves encrypting the password file to prevent unauthorized access to its contents. Secondly, access control enforced by the operating system restricts who can read, write, or execute the file, typically limiting access to privileged system processes. Thirdly, a combination of cryptographic protection and access control can be used, possibly with further measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks, providing a multi-layered defense."
Why is the confidentiality and integrity of the password file critical?,"The confidentiality and integrity of the password file are critical because this file contains sensitive information: user names and their corresponding passwords (or their hashed representations). If an attacker compromises the confidentiality of this file, they could potentially gain access to all user credentials. If the integrity is compromised, an attacker could modify the file, for example, by inserting their own credentials or altering existing ones, leading to unauthorized system access. Therefore, protecting this file is fundamental to overall system security."
How does 'access control enforced by the operating system' protect the password file?,"'Access control enforced by the operating system' protects the password file by defining and regulating which users or processes have permission to access or modify the file. The operating system sets strict rules, typically limiting read access to only authorized authentication processes and write access to highly privileged system administrators or specific system utilities. This prevents unauthorized users or malicious software from directly reading or altering the password file, thereby safeguarding its confidentiality and integrity."
What additional measures can be combined with cryptographic protection and access control for the password file?,"When cryptographic protection and access control are combined for the password file, further measures can be implemented to enhance security, specifically to slow down dictionary attacks. These measures might include using strong, slow hashing algorithms with high work factors for the passwords themselves, which makes offline cracking of the hashes in the file computationally intensive even if the file is obtained. While the document doesn't specify *what* these measures are, it indicates their purpose is to impede dictionary attacks."
What is the primary threat an attacker poses to the password file?,"The primary threat an attacker poses to the password file is to compromise its confidentiality or integrity. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to read the contents of the file, potentially revealing user passwords or their hashes. Compromising integrity means gaining unauthorized ability to modify the file, which could allow an attacker to alter existing credentials or insert new ones, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the system."
Define 'cryptographic protection' in the context of securing the password file.,"'Cryptographic protection' in the context of securing the password file refers to the use of encryption techniques to scramble the contents of the file, making it unreadable to anyone without the appropriate decryption key. This ensures that even if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the password file itself, they cannot easily extract the sensitive user names and passwords without first breaking the encryption, thereby protecting the confidentiality of the stored credentials."
Summarise the key concepts for secure password storage.,"Secure password storage relies on several key concepts. Firstly, 'salting' involves adding a unique, randomly generated string to each password before hashing, making individual password cracking harder and protecting against rainbow tables. Secondly, using 'modern hashing algorithms' like Argon2 or bcrypt, which are intentionally slow and configurable via a 'work factor', makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive. Thirdly, robust 'password policies' are essential, including setting passwords for all accounts, changing default passwords, and enforcing complex password formats (length, case-sensitive, alphanumeric) to avoid guessable passwords. Finally, 'protecting the password file' itself through cryptographic protection, operating system access control, and measures to slow dictionary attacks is crucial to safeguard stored credentials."
What are the main categories of password policies discussed?,"The main categories of password policies discussed are: 1. Setting a password for all user accounts to prevent easy access. 2. Changing default passwords to eliminate known vulnerabilities. 3. Avoiding guessable passwords by prescribing minimal length and complex formats (mix of upper/lower case, numerical, non-alphabetical symbols). 4. Password ageing, which includes setting expiry dates and preventing reuse of old passwords. 5. Limiting login attempts to deter brute-force attacks. 6. Informing the user about login activity (last login time, failed attempts) to alert them to potential attacks."
How do password policies address the issue of guessable passwords?,"Password policies address the issue of guessable passwords by implementing several rules. They prescribe a minimal password length to increase complexity. They also mandate a specific password format, requiring a mix of upper and lower case characters (making them case-sensitive), and the inclusion of numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric). These requirements make passwords harder to guess or derive. Furthermore, policies implicitly acknowledge the existence of online dictionaries for almost every language, which attackers use, by pushing for passwords that are not easily found in such resources."
What are the different types of alternative password forms mentioned?,"The different types of alternative password forms mentioned include: 1. Passphrases, where users enter sentences or long phrases that are hashed into fixed-size passwords. 2. Visual drawing patterns, used on touch interfaces like Android. 3. Picture passwords, where users select objects or patterns in pictures, as seen in Windows 8. 4. One-time passwords, which are valid for a single login session or transaction."
Explain the role of 'slowness' in password hashing algorithms for security.,"The role of 'slowness' in password hashing algorithms is a deliberate security feature designed to make brute-force attacks computationally infeasible. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes that prioritize speed, algorithms like Argon2 and bcrypt are engineered to require significant time and processing power to compute a single hash. This intentional delay means that an attacker attempting to guess passwords by trying millions or billions of combinations would face an extremely long and resource-intensive process, effectively deterring such attacks and protecting user credentials."
