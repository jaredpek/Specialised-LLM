"Define the concept of ""Salting"" in password storage.","Salting is a process in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
"What is a ""salt"" in the context of password hashing?","A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. Its uniqueness for every user forces an attacker to crack hashes individually, using each user's specific salt, rather than pre-computing hashes for common passwords."
Explain how salting enhances the security of stored passwords against attackers.,"Salting enhances password security by making it significantly harder for attackers to crack large numbers of hashes. Because a unique, randomly generated salt is added to each password before hashing, an attacker cannot pre-compute hashes or use rainbow tables effectively. Instead, they are forced to crack hashes one at a time, using the specific salt associated with each user's password. This increases the time and computational resources required for an attack, as the effort scales directly with the number of hashes."
"Why is it important that a salt is ""unique for every user""?","It is important that a salt is unique for every user because this forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective salt for each user. If salts were not unique, an attacker could potentially calculate a hash once for a common password and compare it against every stored hash, significantly speeding up the cracking process. The uniqueness of the salt prevents this by ensuring each hash is distinct, even for identical passwords."
How does salting protect against pre-computing hashes?,"Salting protects against pre-computing hashes by adding a unique, randomly generated string (the salt) to each password before it is hashed. This means that even if two users have the same password, their salted hashes will be different due to their unique salts. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed tables, such as rainbow tables, or database-based lookups, which rely on matching pre-calculated hashes to crack passwords."
Can salting help determine if two users have the same password? Explain.,"No, salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because different salts are used for each user's password, even if the underlying passwords are identical. The unique salts result in different hashes, thus obscuring any commonality between passwords."
List examples of modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords include Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2. When using these algorithms, no additional steps are required to implement salting, as it is handled automatically."
What is a key characteristic of modern hashing algorithms designed for securely storing passwords?,"A key characteristic of modern hashing algorithms designed for securely storing passwords is that they should be slow. This is in contrast to cryptographic hashes like the SHA family or KECCAK, which are designed to be fast. The slowness of password hashing algorithms is a security feature, making brute-force attacks more computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers."
"How can the ""slowness"" of modern password hashing algorithms be adjusted?","The ""slowness"" of modern password hashing algorithms can be configured by changing the ""work factor."" The work factor is a parameter that controls the computational effort required to compute a hash, allowing administrators to balance security needs with system performance. A higher work factor increases the time needed to compute a hash, making brute-force attacks more difficult."
Which password hashing algorithm was recognized as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,Argon2 is the password hashing algorithm that was recognized as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
"If Argon2 is not available, what is the recommended second choice for password storage?","If Argon2 is not available for password storage, the bcrypt password hashing function should be considered the second choice."
"Define ""work factor"" in the context of password hashing algorithms.","The ""work factor"" in the context of password hashing algorithms refers to a configurable parameter that determines how slow the hashing process is. By changing the work factor, the computational effort required to generate a hash can be adjusted. A higher work factor increases the time needed to compute a hash, thereby making brute-force attacks more resource-intensive and time-consuming for an attacker."
"What are the potential difficulties users face when forced to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords?","When users are forced to use long passwords that mix upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, are generated by the system, and changed repeatedly, they may face several difficulties. These include difficulty memorizing complex passwords, difficulty dealing with frequent password changes, and finding ways of re-using their favorite password. Such policies can also lead to users writing down passwords on paper kept close to the computer."
Describe the user behavior that can result from overly strict password policies.,"Overly strict password policies, such as requiring long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords, can lead to undesirable user behaviors. Users may struggle with memorization, find frequent changes burdensome, or resort to re-using favorite passwords. A common outcome is that users write down their passwords on a piece of paper and keep it close to their computer, which undermines the intended security."
Why is it crucial to set a password for a user account?,"It is crucial to set a password for a user account because if no password is set, an attacker does not even have to guess it. This leaves the account completely vulnerable to unauthorized access."
Explain the security risk associated with default passwords.,"Default passwords pose a significant security risk because they often have common, easily guessable values, such as ""manager."" While useful for field engineers installing a system, if left unchanged, these default passwords make it easy for an attacker to break into the system."
What are the recommended characteristics for avoiding guessable passwords?,"To avoid guessable passwords, it is recommended to prescribe a minimal password length. Additionally, the password format should mix upper and lower case characters (making it case-sensitive), and include numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (making it alphanumeric). This complexity makes passwords harder to guess, especially given the existence of online dictionaries for almost every language."
"What is meant by ""password length"" in password policies?","In password policies, ""password length"" refers to the minimal number of characters a password must contain. Prescribing a minimal password length is a measure to avoid guessable passwords, as longer passwords are generally harder to crack through brute-force methods."
"What is meant by ""password format"" in password policies?","In password policies, ""password format"" refers to the required composition of a password. To avoid guessable passwords, the format typically dictates mixing upper and lower case characters (making it case-sensitive) and including numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (making it alphanumeric). This ensures a higher level of complexity and randomness, making passwords more resistant to dictionary attacks and brute-force attempts."
Why should default passwords be changed immediately after system installation?,"Default passwords should be changed immediately after system installation because they often have common, easily guessable values like ""manager."" While convenient for field engineers during installation, leaving them unchanged creates a significant vulnerability, making it easy for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system."
"Define ""password ageing"" as a password policy.","Password ageing is a password policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords to force users to change them regularly. It also includes measures to prevent users from reverting to old passwords, such as keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used, to ensure new passwords are truly distinct."
What are the two main components of a password ageing policy?,"The two main components of a password ageing policy are: 1) setting expiry dates for passwords to compel users to change them regularly, and 2) preventing users from reverting to previously used passwords, for example, by maintaining a history of the last ""ten"" passwords used."
"How do systems typically ""limit login attempts""?","Systems typically limit login attempts by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain number of failed attempts occur, the system reacts by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This mechanism is designed to prevent or discourage further unauthorized access attempts, such as brute-force attacks."
What is the primary purpose of limiting login attempts?,"The primary purpose of limiting login attempts is to prevent or discourage further unauthorized access attempts, such as brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks. By monitoring unsuccessful login attempts and locking the user account after a threshold, the system makes it significantly harder for attackers to guess passwords."
"Why is it important to ""inform the user"" about recent login activity?","It is important to ""inform the user"" about recent login activity to warn them about recently attempted attacks. After a successful login, displaying the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since that time can alert the user to potential unauthorized access attempts on their account, prompting them to take appropriate security measures."
"What is a ""passphrase"" as an alternative form of password?",A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size passwords from these phrases.
"Describe ""visual drawing patterns"" as an alternative password method.","Visual drawing patterns are an alternative password method primarily used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on a grid or set of points, which serves as their password."
"What are ""picture passwords"" and in which operating system were they used?",Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select objects in pictures and patterns to log in. This method was used in Windows 8.
"What are ""one-time passwords""?","One-time passwords are passwords that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short period, providing enhanced security by preventing replay attacks."
List four alternative forms of passwords mentioned in password security concepts.,"Four alternative forms of passwords mentioned are: Passphrases, Visual drawing patterns, Picture passwords, and One-time passwords."
"What is the ""password file"" and what information does it contain?","The ""password file"" is a file maintained by the operating system that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. This file is critical for user authentication and system security."
What are the potential threats an attacker poses to the password file?,"An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the passwords, while compromising integrity means altering the password data."
List the options for protecting the password file.,"The options for protecting the password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, and a combination of cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
"Explain ""cryptographic protection"" as an option for securing the password file.","Cryptographic protection, as an option for securing the password file, involves encrypting the password data within the file. This ensures that even if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the file, the passwords remain unreadable without the decryption key, thus protecting their confidentiality."
"How does ""access control enforced by the operating system"" protect the password file?","Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by restricting who can read, write, or execute the file. This mechanism ensures that only authorized users or processes, such as the operating system's authentication services, can access the password file, thereby preventing unauthorized individuals from compromising its confidentiality or integrity."
Describe a combined approach to protecting the password file.,"A combined approach to protecting the password file involves using both cryptographic protection and access control. This strategy might also include further measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks, such as using strong hashing algorithms with high work factors and salting. This multi-layered defense enhances the security of the password file against various attack vectors."
What is the direct relationship between the time required to crack hashes and the number of hashes when salting is employed?,"When salting is employed, the time required to crack hashes grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. This is because each hash must be cracked individually using its unique salt, preventing attackers from using pre-computed tables or comparing a single calculated hash against multiple stored hashes."
How does salting prevent an attacker from using rainbow tables?,"Salting prevents an attacker from using rainbow tables by adding a unique, randomly generated string (the salt) to each password before hashing. Rainbow tables rely on pre-computed hashes for common passwords. Since each password now has a unique salt, even identical passwords will produce different hashes, rendering pre-computed rainbow tables ineffective as they would need to be generated for every possible salt-password combination, which is computationally infeasible."
"Why are modern password hashing algorithms designed to be ""slow"" unlike crypto hashes?","Modern password hashing algorithms are designed to be ""slow"" specifically for security purposes, unlike crypto hashes such as the SHA family and KECCAK which are designed for speed. The slowness makes brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks computationally intensive and time-consuming for attackers, thereby increasing the cost and difficulty of compromising passwords. This design choice is a deliberate security measure."
Name two fast cryptographic hashes that are *not* suitable for secure password storage.,"Two fast cryptographic hashes that are not suitable for secure password storage are the SHA family and KECCAK. These algorithms are designed for speed, which makes them vulnerable to brute-force attacks when used for password hashing."
What is one specific difficulty users may encounter with frequent password changes?,"One specific difficulty users may encounter with frequent password changes is dealing with the changes themselves, which can be burdensome and lead to frustration or insecure practices like writing down passwords."
What is a common insecure practice users might adopt if passwords are too complex or frequently changed?,A common insecure practice users might adopt if passwords are too complex or frequently changed is writing them down on a piece of paper and keeping it close to the computer. This undermines the security intended by the complex policies.
What is the consequence if a user account has no password set?,"If a user account has no password set, the consequence is that an attacker does not even have to guess it, meaning they can gain immediate and unauthorized access to the account."
Why are online dictionaries a concern when considering password security?,"Online dictionaries are a concern when considering password security because they exist for almost every language. Attackers can use these dictionaries in dictionary attacks to guess common words and phrases as passwords, making it crucial to enforce password policies that include a mix of characters and symbols to prevent such attacks."
"What does ""case-sensitive"" mean in the context of password format?","In the context of password format, ""case-sensitive"" means that the distinction between upper and lower case letters matters. For example, ""Password123"" would be considered different from ""password123"". This requirement increases the complexity and number of possible password combinations, making them harder to guess."
"What does ""alphanumeric"" mean in the context of password format?","In the context of password format, ""alphanumeric"" means that the password should include a combination of alphabetical characters (both upper and lower case) and numerical digits, along with other non-alphabetical symbols. This broadens the character set, making passwords more robust against guessing and brute-force attacks."
How does preventing users from reverting to old passwords enhance security?,"Preventing users from reverting to old passwords enhances security by ensuring that when a password change is enforced, the new password is genuinely different from previous ones. If users could reuse old passwords, the security benefit of regular changes would be negated, as an attacker who compromised an old password could still gain access. Policies often achieve this by keeping a history, such as the last ""ten"" passwords used."
What specific information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to warn them about potential attacks?,"After a successful login, to warn a user about potential attacks, the system should display the time of their last login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This information can alert the user to any suspicious activity on their account."
In which specific context are visual drawing patterns typically used as an alternative password?,"Visual drawing patterns are typically used as an alternative password in the context of touch interfaces, such as those found on Android mobile devices."
What additional measures might be combined with cryptographic protection and access control to protect the password file?,"In addition to cryptographic protection and access control, further measures to slow down dictionary attacks might be combined to protect the password file. These measures could include using strong, slow hashing algorithms with high work factors and salting, which make it computationally expensive for attackers to test many password guesses."
