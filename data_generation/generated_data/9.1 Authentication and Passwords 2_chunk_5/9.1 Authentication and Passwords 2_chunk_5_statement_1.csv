Define the concept of salting in the context of password storage.,"Salting is a security measure in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a ""salt,"" is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This process significantly enhances security by making it harder for attackers to crack large numbers of hashes."
Explain what a 'salt' is in password storage.,"A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password before it is hashed. This string is unique for every user, meaning that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to the distinct salts applied."
How does salting make it harder for an attacker to crack passwords?,"Salting makes cracking passwords significantly harder because the salt is unique for every user. This forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required to crack passwords grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks much more time-consuming and resource-intensive."
What additional protection does salting provide against pre-computation attacks?,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using methods like rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Since each password has a unique salt, pre-computed tables of common password hashes become ineffective, as the attacker would need to pre-compute hashes for every possible password-salt combination, which is computationally infeasible."
How does salting prevent an attacker from determining if two users have the same password?,"Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because different salts will result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical. An attacker cannot simply compare stored hashes to identify users with the same password."
List some modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This means that when these algorithms are used, no additional steps are required by the developer or system administrator to implement salting, as it is an inherent feature of their design."
What is the primary characteristic of modern hashing algorithms designed for securely storing passwords?,"Modern hashing algorithms designed for securely storing passwords are characterized by being intentionally slow. Unlike cryptographic hashes (such as the SHA family and KECCAK) which are designed for speed, password hashing algorithms are designed to be computationally intensive to deter brute-force attacks. Their slowness can often be configured by changing a ""work factor""."
How can the slowness of modern password hashing algorithms be configured?,"The slowness of modern password hashing algorithms can be configured by changing the ""work factor."" This parameter allows administrators to adjust the computational effort required to hash a password, increasing the difficulty for attackers as hardware capabilities improve over time."
Which algorithm won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,"Argon2 is the algorithm that won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. It is considered a strong choice for securely storing passwords due to its design, which includes resistance to various types of attacks."
What is the recommended second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available?,"If Argon2 is not available, the bcrypt password hashing function should be the second choice for password storage. Bcrypt is another robust algorithm designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks."
"What are the potential difficulties users face when forced to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords?","Users may face several difficulties when forced to use such passwords: 1. They may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords. 2. They may have difficulty dealing with frequent password changes. 3. They may find ways of re-using their favorite password, circumventing the policy's intent."
Why is it generally considered a bad idea to write down your password?,"It is generally considered a bad idea to write down your password because if it is kept close to the computer, an attacker gaining physical access to the machine could easily find the written password, compromising the account's security."
Why is it crucial to set a password for a user account?,"It is crucial to set a password for a user account because if there is no password, an attacker does not even have to guess it. They can simply access the account without any authentication, leading to immediate compromise."
Explain why default passwords pose a security risk and should be changed.,"Default passwords, such as a system account having a default value like ""manager,"" pose a significant security risk. While they help field engineers during system installation, if left unchanged, they make it extremely easy for an attacker to break into the system, as these default values are often publicly known or easily guessable."
"What are the recommended characteristics for a strong, non-guessable password?","For a strong, non-guessable password, the recommended characteristics include: mixing upper and lower case characters (making it case-sensitive), including numerical symbols, and incorporating other non-alphabetical symbols (making it alphanumeric). Additionally, a minimal password length should be prescribed."
What is the purpose of prescribing a minimal password length?,"The purpose of prescribing a minimal password length is to increase the complexity and the time required for an attacker to guess or brute-force a password. Longer passwords have a larger keyspace, making them more resistant to dictionary attacks and brute-force attempts."
What is 'password ageing' as a password policy?,"Password ageing is a password policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords. Its purpose is to force users to change their passwords regularly, reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a compromised password."
How do password ageing policies prevent users from reverting to old passwords?,"Password ageing policies prevent users from reverting to old passwords by typically keeping a list of previously used passwords, for example, the last ""ten"" passwords. This ensures that users create new, unique passwords each time they are forced to change them, rather than cycling through a small set of familiar ones."
How can a system limit login attempts to enhance security?,"A system can limit login attempts by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain threshold of failed attempts is reached, the system can react by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This measure prevents or discourages further brute-force attempts by an attacker."
Why is it important to inform a user about recent login activity?,"It is important to inform a user about recent login activity to warn them about recently attempted attacks. After a successful login, the system should display the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since, allowing the user to identify suspicious activity and take appropriate action if their account is being targeted."
Define a 'passphrase' as an alternative form of password.,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size password from this passphrase, providing a more user-friendly yet secure authentication method."
What are 'visual drawing patterns' in the context of alternative passwords?,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password typically used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on a grid or set of points, which the system then verifies."
Describe 'picture passwords' and where they are used.,"Picture passwords are an alternative form of password where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns for authentication. This method was notably used in Windows 8, allowing for a more visual and potentially easier-to-remember authentication process."
What is the 'password file' maintained by an operating system?,"The 'password file' is a file maintained by the operating system that stores user names and their corresponding passwords, typically in a hashed or encrypted format. This file is critical for user authentication and system security."
What are the potential threats an attacker poses to the password file?,"An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the password data, while compromising integrity means altering the password data, both of which can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts."
List the options for protecting the password file.,"The options for protecting the password file include: cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, or a combination of cryptographic protection and access control. Further measures can also be implemented to slow down dictionary attacks."
What does 'cryptographic protection' entail for the password file?,"Cryptographic protection for the password file involves encrypting or hashing the passwords stored within it. This ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the file, the passwords are not immediately readable in plain text, making it much harder to compromise user accounts."
How does 'access control enforced by the operating system' protect the password file?,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by restricting who can read, write, or execute operations on the file. Typically, only privileged system processes or administrators are granted access, preventing unauthorized users or applications from tampering with it."
What is a combined approach to protecting the password file?,"A combined approach to protecting the password file involves using both cryptographic protection and access control. This layered security strategy provides robust defense, as an attacker would need to bypass both the operating system's access restrictions and the cryptographic measures to compromise the password data. Additional measures can also be included to slow down dictionary attacks."
Why are modern hashing algorithms designed to be slow?,"Modern hashing algorithms are designed to be slow to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming for attackers. This slowness, configurable via a ""work factor,"" increases the cost and time required for an attacker to test a large number of possible passwords, thus enhancing security."
What is the difference between modern password hashing algorithms and crypto hashes like SHA family?,"The primary difference is their design goal: modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed to be slow and computationally intensive to deter brute-force password cracking, while crypto hashes like the SHA family and KECCAK are designed to be fast for general cryptographic purposes such as data integrity checks."
What is the implication of a salt being 'unique for every user'?,"The implication of a salt being 'unique for every user' is that even if multiple users choose the exact same password, their stored hashes will be different because a distinct, randomly generated salt is applied to each. This prevents attackers from identifying users with identical passwords by simply comparing hashes."
How does salting impact the time required for an attacker to crack hashes?,"Salting significantly increases the time required for an attacker to crack hashes. Because each hash is salted with a unique string, an attacker cannot use pre-computed tables or crack multiple hashes simultaneously. Instead, they must crack each hash individually using its specific salt, meaning the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
What does 'case-sensitive' mean in the context of password format?,"In the context of password format, 'case-sensitive' means that the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters matters. For example, 'Password123' would be considered different from 'password123', increasing the complexity and the number of possible combinations an attacker would need to guess."
What are 'alphanumeric' symbols in password policies?,"'Alphanumeric' symbols in password policies refer to a combination of alphabetical characters (A-Z, a-z) and numerical digits (0-9). When a password policy requires alphanumeric symbols, it means the password must include at least some characters from both categories."
Why are on-line dictionaries a concern for password security?,"On-line dictionaries are a concern for password security because they exist for almost every language today. Attackers can use these dictionaries in dictionary attacks to quickly test common words and phrases as passwords, making it easy to crack passwords that are simple words or common combinations."
What is the benefit of using a passphrase over a traditional password?,"The benefit of using a passphrase over a traditional password is that users can enter sentences or long phrases that are easier for them to remember. Despite being easy to recall, these longer phrases can still result in a strong, complex actual password when processed by a hash function, offering both security and usability."
How do one-time passwords function?,"One-time passwords are a form of authentication where a password is valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short period, providing enhanced security by making replay attacks impossible."
What is the role of a hash function in processing a passphrase?,"The role of a hash function in processing a passphrase is to compute a fixed-size actual password from the user-entered sentence or long phrase. This hash function transforms the variable-length passphrase into a consistent, fixed-length output that is then stored and used for authentication, rather than storing the passphrase itself."
What is the primary goal of password policies?,"The primary goal of password policies is to enhance the security of user accounts and systems by establishing rules for creating, managing, and protecting passwords, thereby making it harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access."
Why is it important to avoid guessable passwords?,"It is important to avoid guessable passwords because attackers can easily compromise accounts using methods like dictionary attacks, which leverage common words, phrases, and patterns. Guessable passwords offer little to no resistance to such attacks."
What is a 'work factor' in password hashing algorithms?,"A 'work factor' is a configurable parameter in modern password hashing algorithms that determines how slow or computationally intensive the hashing process will be. By adjusting the work factor, administrators can increase the time and resources required to compute a hash, making brute-force attacks more difficult."
How does the operating system contribute to password file protection?,"The operating system contributes to password file protection by maintaining the file itself and enforcing access control mechanisms. These mechanisms restrict unauthorized users or processes from reading, modifying, or deleting the password file, thereby safeguarding its confidentiality and integrity."
What is the risk of not changing default passwords?,"The risk of not changing default passwords is that they are often publicly known or easily discoverable. If left unchanged, an attacker can exploit these known default values to easily break into the system, bypassing security measures without needing to guess or crack a unique password."
What does it mean for a password to be 'complex'?,"For a password to be 'complex', it typically means it incorporates a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols. This variety increases the number of possible character combinations, making it harder for attackers to guess or brute-force."
How do frequent password changes impact user behavior?,"Frequent password changes can negatively impact user behavior by causing difficulty in memorizing new complex passwords. This may lead users to write down their passwords or find ways to re-use favorite passwords, potentially undermining the security benefits of the policy."
What is the purpose of displaying the time of last login to a user?,"The purpose of displaying the time of last login to a user after a successful login is to provide an immediate indicator of any unauthorized access. If the user sees a last login time that they do not recognize, it serves as a warning that their account may have been compromised."
How does displaying the number of failed login attempts benefit security?,"Displaying the number of failed login attempts since the last successful login benefits security by alerting the user to potential attacks. If this number is unexpectedly high, it indicates that an attacker might be attempting to gain unauthorized access to their account, prompting the user to take protective measures."
Why are long passwords generally more secure?,Long passwords are generally more secure because they significantly increase the number of possible combinations an attacker would need to try in a brute-force attack. This exponential increase in the search space makes it computationally much more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to crack the password.
What is the primary objective of 'Password Storage Concepts'?,"The primary objective of 'Password Storage Concepts' is to outline methods and algorithms that ensure passwords are stored securely, making them resistant to various forms of attack, such as brute-force attempts, dictionary attacks, and pre-computation attacks, even if the password database is compromised."
