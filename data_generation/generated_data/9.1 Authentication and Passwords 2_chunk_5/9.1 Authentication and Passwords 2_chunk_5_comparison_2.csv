Compare salting with a hashing process that does not use salting for password storage.,"Salting involves adding a unique, randomly generated string, known as a **salt**, to each password as part of the hashing process. This salt is unique for every user. In a hashing process without salting, an attacker could calculate a hash once and compare it against every stored hash. With salting, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt, which makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. Salting also protects against pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Furthermore, salting means that it is impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes, because the different salts will result in different hashes even if the passwords are the same."
What are the key differences between modern hashing algorithms designed for password storage and cryptographic hashes like the SHA family or KECCAK?,"Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, are specifically designed for securely storing passwords. A key difference is that they are designed to be **slow**, unlike cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family and KECCAK, which are designed to be fast. The slowness of modern hashing algorithms can be configured by changing the **work factor**. Additionally, modern hashing algorithms automatically salt the passwords, meaning no additional steps are required for salting when using them."
Compare Argon2 with bcrypt in the context of password hashing algorithms.,"Argon2 is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. The bcrypt password hashing function is considered the second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available. Both are examples of modern hashing algorithms designed for securely storing passwords, meaning they are intentionally slow and can have their slowness configured by a **work factor**."
"Discuss the trade-offs between forcing users to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords versus the potential user experience and security implications.","While forcing users to use long passwords, mixing upper and lower case characters and numerical symbols, generating them by the system, and changing them repeatedly might seem to enhance security, it introduces several challenges. Users may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, leading to them writing passwords down on a piece of paper kept close to the computer, which is a security risk. Users may also have difficulty dealing with frequent password changes, and they might find ways of re-using their favorite password, undermining the intent of frequent changes."
What is the security difference between setting a password for a user account and having no password at all?,"If there is no password for a user account, an attacker does not even have to guess it to gain access. This represents a significant security vulnerability. Setting a password, even a simple one, forces an attacker to at least attempt to guess or crack the password, thereby providing a basic layer of protection."
Compare the security implications of changing default passwords versus leaving them unchanged.,"Default passwords, often having values like ""manager"" for system accounts, are helpful for field engineers during system installation. However, if these default passwords are left unchanged, it becomes easy for an attacker to break into the system. Changing default passwords removes this known vulnerability, significantly enhancing security by forcing attackers to guess or crack unique credentials rather than exploiting common, pre-set ones."
Explain the concept of password ageing and how it differs from a policy with no password expiry.,"**Password ageing** involves setting expiry dates for passwords to force users to change them regularly. This policy also typically includes measures to prevent users from reverting to old passwords, such as keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used. In contrast, a policy with no password expiry allows users to keep the same password indefinitely. Password ageing aims to reduce the risk of compromised passwords being used over long periods by ensuring they are regularly updated, whereas no expiry means a compromised password could remain valid for an extended time."
Compare the security benefits of limiting login attempts with allowing unlimited login attempts.,"Limiting login attempts means the system monitors unsuccessful login attempts and reacts by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This measure is designed to prevent or discourage further brute-force or dictionary attacks by making it difficult for an attacker to repeatedly guess passwords. Allowing unlimited login attempts, on the other hand, provides no such deterrent, enabling attackers to try an infinite number of password combinations without consequence, making the system highly vulnerable to automated attacks."
What are the advantages of informing a user about their last login time and failed login attempts compared to not providing such information?,"After a successful login, displaying the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since that time serves to warn the user about recently attempted attacks. This information allows users to detect unauthorized access or attempts to compromise their account, enabling them to take action, such as changing their password or reporting suspicious activity. Not providing such information leaves users unaware of potential security breaches or attempts, delaying their response to threats."
How does a passphrase differ from a traditional password?,"A **passphrase** is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the (fixed-size) actual passwords. A traditional password typically refers to a shorter string of characters, often with specific requirements for mixing upper and lower case, numerical, and non-alphabetical symbols. The key difference lies in the length and structure: passphrases leverage longer, more memorable phrases, while traditional passwords often rely on complexity within a shorter string."
Compare visual drawing patterns with picture passwords as alternative forms of authentication.,"**Visual drawing patterns** are an alternative form of password typically used on touch interfaces, such as in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on a grid. **Picture passwords**, on the other hand, involve selecting objects in pictures and patterns. This method was used in Windows 8, where users would interact with a chosen image by performing specific gestures (e.g., taps, circles, lines) on predefined points. The primary difference is the interaction method and context: drawing patterns on a grid versus interacting with elements within a chosen image."
What are the differences between cryptographic protection and access control as methods for protecting the password file?,"**Cryptographic protection** involves encrypting the password file, making its contents unreadable without the correct decryption key. This protects the confidentiality of the passwords even if an attacker gains access to the file. **Access control**, enforced by the operating system, restricts who can read, write, or execute the password file. This prevents unauthorized users or processes from accessing the file in the first place. While cryptographic protection secures the data itself, access control secures access to the data. They can also be combined for enhanced security."
Compare using a combination of cryptographic protection and access control for the password file with using only a single method.,"Using a **combination of cryptographic protection and access control** for the password file offers a layered security approach. Cryptographic protection encrypts the file's contents, safeguarding confidentiality even if access controls are bypassed. Access control, enforced by the operating system, restricts unauthorized access to the file itself. This combination, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks, provides more robust protection against compromise of confidentiality or integrity. Relying on only a single method, such as just cryptographic protection or just access control, leaves a potential single point of failure. For instance, if access control is breached, an unencrypted file is immediately exposed. If cryptographic protection is the only defense, a weakness in the encryption or key management could compromise the file."
"How does salting protect against rainbow tables, and how does this differ from its role in preventing the determination of identical passwords?","Salting protects against **rainbow tables** by making pre-computing hashes ineffective. A **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string added to each password before hashing. Since each password has a unique salt, the hash generated for a given password will be different for every user, even if they use the same password. This means a pre-computed rainbow table, which maps common password hashes, cannot be used to crack multiple passwords simultaneously. This differs from salting's role in preventing the determination of identical passwords because, due to the unique salt for every user, different salts will result in different hashes even if two users have the exact same password. This makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking each hash individually, thus enhancing privacy and security."
Explain the relationship between modern hashing algorithms being slow and their configurable slowness.,"Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, are specifically designed to be **slow** for securely storing passwords, unlike fast cryptographic hashes. This inherent slowness is a security feature, making brute-force attacks computationally expensive. The **configurable slowness** means that how slow these algorithms are can be adjusted by changing their **work factor**. The work factor is a parameter that controls the computational effort required to compute the hash, allowing administrators to balance security with performance based on available resources and evolving computational power."
Compare the roles of prescribing a minimal password length and defining a specific password format in avoiding guessable passwords.,"Prescribing a **minimal password length** increases the total number of possible password combinations, making brute-force attacks more time-consuming. A longer password inherently has a larger search space for an attacker. Defining a specific **password format**, such as requiring a mix of upper and lower case (case-sensitive), numerical, and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric), aims to prevent attackers from guessing passwords easily, especially those found in online dictionaries. While length increases the search space, format ensures complexity and diversity of characters, making dictionary attacks and simple pattern-based guesses less effective. Both are crucial for avoiding guessable passwords."
"Discuss the dual nature of default passwords, comparing their utility for field engineers with their inherent security risks.","Default passwords, such as ""manager"" for system accounts, serve a practical purpose by helping **field engineers** during the installation of a system, providing a known credential for initial setup. However, this utility is directly contrasted by their significant **security risk**. If these default passwords are left unchanged after installation, they become an easy target for attackers, as these values are often publicly known or easily guessable. An attacker can exploit these unchanged defaults to break into the system without needing to guess or crack a unique password."
Compare the security implications of preventing users from reverting to old passwords with allowing them to reuse old passwords.,"Preventing users from reverting to old passwords, for example, by keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used, is a security measure under **password ageing**. This policy ensures that even if a user's old password was compromised, they cannot simply switch back to it, forcing them to create a new, distinct password. Allowing the reuse of old passwords, however, negates the security benefits of regular password changes. If a user reuses a password that was previously compromised, their account remains vulnerable, as an attacker who knows the old password can regain access."
"How do the two aspects of password ageing, forcing regular changes and preventing old password reuse, contribute to security differently?","**Password ageing** involves two main aspects. Firstly, it sets expiry dates for passwords to **force users to change passwords regularly**. This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password, as its validity period is limited. Secondly, it aims to **prevent users from reverting to old passwords**, for example, by keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used. This aspect ensures that when a password is changed, it is genuinely a new, distinct password, rather than a cycle back to a potentially compromised or easily guessable previous one. While forcing regular changes limits the lifespan of a compromised password, preventing reuse ensures that the new password actually enhances security rather than reintroducing an old vulnerability."
What is the difference between compromising the confidentiality of the password file and compromising its integrity?,"Compromising the **confidentiality** of the password file means an attacker gains unauthorized access to read the contents of the file, revealing user names and their associated (hashed) passwords. This allows the attacker to potentially crack the passwords offline. Compromising the **integrity** of the password file means an attacker gains unauthorized ability to modify or tamper with the file's contents. This could involve changing existing passwords, adding new user accounts, or altering password hashes, leading to unauthorized access or denial of service. Confidentiality is about keeping the information secret, while integrity is about keeping the information accurate and unaltered."
Compare cryptographic protection of the password file with measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks.,"**Cryptographic protection** of the password file involves encrypting its contents, making the stored user names and passwords unreadable without the correct decryption key. This primarily safeguards the **confidentiality** of the file, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access to the file, they cannot easily read the passwords. Measures to **slow down dictionary attacks**, often implemented as part of a combination of protection methods, are designed to make it computationally expensive for an attacker to test many password guesses. While cryptographic protection secures the data at rest, slowing down dictionary attacks typically involves making the hashing process itself slow (e.g., using a high work factor in modern hashing algorithms) or by limiting login attempts, which directly hinders the attacker's ability to rapidly try dictionary words."
"Compare the SHA family and KECCAK with Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 in terms of their primary design goals for hashing.","The SHA family and KECCAK are cryptographic hash functions designed to be **fast**. They are optimized for quick computation, making them suitable for data integrity checks, digital signatures, and other applications where speed is paramount. In contrast, Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 are modern hashing algorithms specifically designed for **securely storing passwords**. Their primary design goal is to be **slow**, making brute-force attacks computationally intensive and therefore impractical. This slowness can be configured via a **work factor**. Additionally, Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically incorporate salting, a feature not inherently part of the SHA family or KECCAK's core design for general-purpose hashing."
"Explain the concept of a ""work factor"" in modern password hashing algorithms and how it differs from the fixed speed of cryptographic hashes like SHA family.","In modern hashing algorithms designed for password storage, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, the **work factor** is a configurable parameter that determines how slow the hashing process will be. By changing the work factor, the computational effort required to compute a hash can be adjusted, allowing for a balance between security and performance. A higher work factor means a slower, more secure hash. Cryptographic hashes like the SHA family and KECCAK, however, are designed to be **fast** and generally operate at a fixed, optimized speed. They do not have a configurable work factor to intentionally slow them down, as their purpose is efficient data hashing rather than password protection against brute-force attacks."
Compare rainbow tables with database-based lookups as methods an attacker might use for pre-computing hashes.,"Both **rainbow tables** and **database-based lookups** are methods an attacker might use for pre-computing hashes to speed up password cracking. A rainbow table is a pre-computed table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, effectively mapping hashes back to their original passwords. It's a space-time trade-off, where pre-computation saves time during the attack. Database-based lookups refer to an attacker having access to a database of known password-hash pairs, possibly from previous breaches or common password lists. The attacker can then simply look up a stolen hash in their database to find the corresponding password. Salting protects against both by ensuring that each password's hash is unique due to a unique salt, making pre-computed tables or databases of generic hashes ineffective."
"How does salting make cracking large numbers of hashes harder, and how does this relate to its protection against pre-computation?","Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the **salt** is unique for every user. This forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. This mechanism directly contributes to its protection against **pre-computing hashes** using rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Because each hash is uniquely salted, a generic pre-computed table (like a rainbow table) or a database of common password-hash pairs cannot be used to efficiently crack multiple passwords. Each hash effectively becomes a unique target, rendering mass pre-computation strategies inefficient."
Compare the user challenges of difficulty memorizing complex passwords with difficulty dealing with frequent password changes.,"When users are forced to use complex passwords (long, mixing character types, system-generated), a common challenge is the **difficulty memorizing** them. This often leads to insecure practices like writing passwords down. Separately, users may experience **difficulty dealing with frequent password changes**. This can lead to frustration, forgotten passwords, or users finding ways of re-using their favorite password, which undermines the security benefit of regular changes. While both relate to user burden, memorization difficulty is about the complexity of a single password, whereas dealing with frequent changes is about the ongoing management and creation of new, distinct passwords over time."
Compare the security risks associated with users writing down their passwords versus re-using their favorite passwords.,"When users find complex passwords difficult to memorize or frequent changes burdensome, they might resort to writing passwords down on a piece of paper kept close to the computer. This creates a physical security vulnerability, as anyone with physical access to the user's environment can discover the password. Alternatively, users might find ways of re-using their favorite password. This risk means that if one account using that ""favorite"" password is compromised, all other accounts using the same password become vulnerable, leading to a cascading security failure. Both are significant risks, but writing down passwords is a physical compromise, while re-using passwords is a logical compromise across multiple services."
"Compare the objectives of the password policy ""Set a password"" with ""Avoid guessable passwords.""","The objective of the ""Set a password"" policy is fundamental: to ensure that a user account has any password at all. If there is no password, an attacker does not even have to guess it, making the account completely vulnerable. The objective of ""Avoid guessable passwords"" is to ensure that the password chosen, once set, is robust against common attack methods. This involves prescribing a minimal password length and a specific password format (mix of upper/lower case, numerical, non-alphabetical symbols) to counter dictionary attacks and brute-force attempts. ""Set a password"" is about existence, while ""Avoid guessable passwords"" is about quality."
"Compare the security goals of the password policy ""Change default passwords"" with ""Password ageing.""","The security goal of ""Change default passwords"" is to eliminate a known, easily exploitable vulnerability. Default passwords (e.g., ""manager"") are common and, if left unchanged, allow attackers easy access. This policy addresses initial system setup security. ""Password ageing,"" on the other hand, aims to maintain ongoing security by setting expiry dates for passwords, forcing regular changes, and preventing users from reverting to old passwords. This policy addresses the risk of long-term compromise of a password and ensures freshness. ""Change default passwords"" is a one-time critical step, while ""Password ageing"" is a continuous security practice."
"Compare the security mechanisms of ""Limit login attempts"" with ""Inform user"" as password policies.","The ""Limit login attempts"" policy is a proactive security mechanism where the system monitors unsuccessful login attempts and reacts by locking the user account (temporarily or permanently). Its purpose is to prevent or discourage brute-force and dictionary attacks by making repeated guessing impossible or impractical. The ""Inform user"" policy is a reactive security mechanism. After a successful login, it displays the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since. Its purpose is to warn the user about recently attempted attacks, empowering them to take action if suspicious activity is detected. One prevents attacks, the other helps detect and respond to them."
Compare passphrases with one-time passwords as alternative forms of authentication.,"A **passphrase** is an alternative form of password where the user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the (fixed-size) actual passwords. Passphrases are designed to be memorable and reusable by the user, offering a more user-friendly alternative to complex traditional passwords. **One-time passwords** (OTPs), however, are credentials that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short time. OTPs enhance security by ensuring that even if intercepted, they cannot be reused for subsequent access. The key difference is reusability: passphrases are designed for repeated use, while OTPs are strictly single-use."
Compare protecting the password file using only access control with using a combination of cryptographic protection and access control.,"Protecting the password file using only **access control enforced by the operating system** restricts who can read, write, or execute the file. This prevents unauthorized users or processes from accessing the file's contents. However, if the access control mechanism itself is bypassed or compromised, the file's contents become exposed. Using a **combination of cryptographic protection and access control** provides a stronger defense. Cryptographic protection encrypts the file, making its contents unreadable even if access control fails. This layered approach ensures that even if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the file (bypassing access control), they still cannot read the sensitive password data without the decryption key. This combination can also include further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
"How does salting make cracking large numbers of hashes harder, and how does this differ from its role in making it impossible to determine if two users have the same password?","Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes harder because a **salt** is unique for every user. This means an attacker cannot pre-compute hashes or use rainbow tables effectively, as they must crack each hash individually using its specific salt. The time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. This differs from salting's role in making it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. Because different salts are used for each user, even if two users enter the exact same password, the hashing process will produce two entirely different hashes. This prevents an attacker from simply comparing hashes to identify users with identical passwords, thus enhancing privacy and security."
Compare modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords with older methods that might require additional steps for salting.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 **automatically salt the passwords**. This means that when these algorithms are used, the unique, randomly generated salt is incorporated into the hashing process without requiring any additional, explicit steps from the developer or system administrator. This simplifies implementation and reduces the risk of salting being overlooked. Older or more generic hashing methods, particularly those not specifically designed for password storage, might require **additional steps for salting**. In such cases, the salt would need to be generated, stored, and explicitly combined with the password before hashing, adding complexity and potential for error in implementation."
Compare Argon2's status as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition with bcrypt's recommendation as a second choice.,"Argon2 is distinguished as the **winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition**, indicating its superior design and security properties as evaluated by experts in the field. This makes it the recommended primary choice for password storage. Bcrypt, while a robust and widely respected password hashing function, is recommended as the **second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available**. This suggests that while bcrypt is highly secure, Argon2 is considered to have marginal advantages or better performance characteristics under certain conditions, as determined by the competition. Both are modern hashing algorithms designed to be slow and automatically salt passwords."
Compare the security benefits of prescribing a minimal password length with requiring an alphanumeric password format.,"Prescribing a **minimal password length** directly increases the search space for an attacker attempting a brute-force attack. A longer password means there are exponentially more possible combinations, making it take significantly longer to guess. Requiring an **alphanumeric password format** (mix of upper and lower case, numerical, and other non-alphabetical symbols) enhances security by making passwords less predictable and more resistant to dictionary attacks. While length increases the sheer number of possibilities, the alphanumeric format ensures that those possibilities are diverse and not easily found in common word lists or simple patterns. Both contribute to avoiding guessable passwords."
What are the security implications of a password policy requiring case-sensitive passwords compared to one allowing non-case-sensitive passwords?,"A password policy requiring **case-sensitive** passwords means that ""Password"" is treated as different from ""password"" or ""PASSWORD"". This effectively increases the character set available for each position in the password, significantly expanding the total number of possible combinations and making brute-force attacks much harder. A policy allowing **non-case-sensitive** passwords, however, treats all letters as if they were the same case. This drastically reduces the effective character set, making passwords much easier to guess or crack, as an attacker only needs to consider one case for each letter. Case-sensitivity is a crucial component of a strong password format."
Compare the primary protection offered by cryptographic protection of the password file versus access control enforced by the operating system.,"**Cryptographic protection** of the password file primarily offers **confidentiality**. It encrypts the file's contents, ensuring that even if an unauthorized entity gains access to the file, the sensitive information (user names and hashed passwords) remains unreadable without the correct decryption key. **Access control enforced by the operating system**, on the other hand, primarily offers **authorization and integrity**. It dictates who (which users or processes) can access the file and what operations they can perform (read, write, execute). This prevents unauthorized access to the file itself. While cryptographic protection secures the data, access control secures the container of the data."
Compare the theoretical ideal of highest password security through complex passwords with the practical difficulties users face.,"Theoretically, password security is highest if users are forced to use long passwords, mixing upper and lower case characters and numerical symbols, generated for them by the system, and changed repeatedly. This maximizes the entropy and minimizes the predictability of passwords. However, practically, users may have **difficulty memorizing complex passwords**, leading to them being written down. They may also have **difficulty dealing with frequent password changes**, which can lead to frustration and the re-use of favorite passwords. These practical difficulties can undermine the theoretical security benefits by leading to insecure user behaviors."
"How does salting make cracking large numbers of hashes harder, and how is this related to the time required growing in direct proportion to the number of hashes?","Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because a **salt** is unique for every user. This forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each. This process means that the **time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes**. Unlike unsalted hashes where an attacker might calculate a hash once and compare it against many stored hashes, salting ensures that each hash requires an individual, unique computation. This direct proportionality means that attacking a database of a million salted hashes takes a million times longer than attacking a single salted hash, making large-scale attacks computationally prohibitive."
"Compare the initial security measures of ""Set a password"" and ""Change default passwords"" in password policies.","The ""Set a password"" policy is the most fundamental initial security measure, ensuring that a user account has any password at all. Without it, an attacker gains immediate access without guessing. The ""Change default passwords"" policy addresses a specific initial vulnerability where system accounts often come with easily guessable or publicly known default values (e.g., ""manager""). If these are left unchanged, they provide an easy entry point for attackers. Both are critical initial steps, but ""Set a password"" ensures a barrier exists, while ""Change default passwords"" ensures that barrier isn't a widely known weak point."
"Compare the long-term security goals of ""Avoid guessable passwords"" with ""Password ageing.""","The ""Avoid guessable passwords"" policy aims to ensure that the passwords users create are inherently strong and resistant to common attack methods like dictionary attacks and brute-force guessing. This is achieved by prescribing minimal length and complex formats (case-sensitive, alphanumeric). Its goal is to make individual passwords hard to crack. ""Password ageing,"" on the other hand, focuses on the lifecycle of passwords. It sets expiry dates to force regular changes and prevents the reuse of old passwords. Its goal is to limit the window of vulnerability for any single password and ensure that even if a password is compromised, it has a limited lifespan. One focuses on password strength, the other on password freshness and rotation."

Its primary goal is to reduce the risk associated with long-lived or reused passwords by forcing users to update them regularly. One deals with attack attempts, the other with password longevity and freshness."
"Compare the security benefits of ""Inform user"" with ""Change default passwords.""","The ""Inform user"" policy provides a reactive security benefit by displaying the time of last login and failed attempts after a successful login. This empowers users to detect and respond to potential unauthorized access attempts. ""Change default passwords"" provides a proactive and fundamental security benefit by eliminating easily exploitable, known vulnerabilities present in default system account passwords. This prevents attackers from gaining initial access through common credentials. One helps detect ongoing threats, the other prevents initial, easy breaches."
"Compare how ""Avoid guessable passwords"" and ""Limit login attempts"" contribute to preventing unauthorized access.","""Avoid guessable passwords"" contributes to preventing unauthorized access by making individual passwords inherently difficult to guess or crack. This is achieved through requirements for minimal length and complex formats (case-sensitive, alphanumeric), which thwart dictionary attacks and simple brute-force attempts. ""Limit login attempts"" contributes by actively blocking or slowing down an attacker who is attempting to guess passwords. By monitoring unsuccessful attempts and locking accounts, it prevents an attacker from making an unlimited number of guesses, thus making brute-force attacks impractical. One makes the target harder to hit, the other limits the number of shots an attacker can take."

"Compare the security benefits of ""Change default passwords"" with ""Limit login attempts.""","""Change default passwords"" provides the benefit of eliminating a critical initial vulnerability. Default passwords are often well-known and, if unchanged, offer an easy entry point for attackers. This policy secures the initial setup of accounts.

Default passwords are often common and easily exploited, so this policy ensures that these initial weak points are secured immediately after system setup. One is about continuous maintenance of user passwords, the other about securing the system's initial configuration."
What are the differences between a password policy that prescribes a minimal password length and one that does not?,"A password policy that **prescribes a minimal password length** requires users to create passwords that meet a certain character count, such as 8 or 12 characters. This increases the total number of possible password combinations, making brute-force attacks significantly more time-consuming and computationally expensive for an attacker. A policy that **does not prescribe a minimal password length** allows users to set very short passwords. Short passwords have a much smaller search space, making them highly susceptible to brute-force attacks, where an attacker can quickly try all possible combinations to find the correct password."
Compare the security benefits of requiring a mix of upper and lower case characters in passwords with only requiring a single case.,"Requiring a **mix of upper and lower case characters** in passwords significantly increases the complexity and the number of possible character combinations for each position in the password. For example, if a character can be either 'a' or 'A', it effectively doubles the options for that position, making the password much harder to guess or crack through brute-force or dictionary attacks. Only requiring a **single case** (e.g., all lowercase or all uppercase) drastically reduces the effective character set. This simplifies the attacker's task, as they do not need to consider case variations, making passwords much easier to compromise."
How does including numerical symbols in a password format enhance security compared to only using alphabetical characters?,"Including **numerical symbols** in a password format, alongside alphabetical characters, enhances security by expanding the character set available for password creation. This increases the total number of possible password combinations, making the password more resistant to brute-force attacks. If a password format only uses **alphabetical characters**, the search space for an attacker is limited to letters. By adding numbers, the attacker must consider digits 0-9 for each position, significantly increasing the complexity and the time required to guess or crack the password, especially when combined with mixed-case letters and other non-alphabetical symbols."
Compare the security implications of including non-alphabetical symbols in passwords with only using alphanumeric characters.,"Including **non-alphabetical symbols** (e.g., !, @, #, $, %) in passwords, in addition to alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers), significantly increases the complexity and entropy of the password. This expands the character set even further, making passwords much more resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks, as attackers must account for a wider range of special characters. If passwords only use **alphanumeric characters**, the attacker's search space is limited to letters and numbers. While better than just alphabetical, adding non-alphabetical symbols makes the password exponentially harder to guess, especially against sophisticated cracking tools that might target common alphanumeric patterns."
What are the differences between a password policy that prevents reverting to old passwords and one that allows it?,"A password policy that **prevents users from reverting to old passwords**, for example, by keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used, is a crucial component of password ageing. This ensures that when a user changes their password, they are forced to create a genuinely new and distinct one, mitigating the risk that a previously compromised or easily guessable password is reused. A policy that **allows users to revert to old passwords** undermines the security benefits of regular password changes. If a user can simply cycle back to a password they used before, especially one that might have been compromised, their account remains vulnerable, and the effort of changing passwords becomes largely ineffective."
