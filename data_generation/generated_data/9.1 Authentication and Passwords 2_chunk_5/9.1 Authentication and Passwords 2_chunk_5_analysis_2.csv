Analyse the concept of Salting in password storage.,"Salting is a security measure in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This means that for every user, a distinct salt is used. The primary benefit of salting is that it significantly increases the difficulty for an attacker to crack large numbers of hashes. Instead of calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt for each user. This causes the time required for cracking to grow in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks much harder."
What insights can be derived from the analysis of salting's protection mechanisms?,"Salting provides crucial protection against several attack vectors. Firstly, it protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using methods like rainbow tables or database-based lookups. A **rainbow table** is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. By adding a unique salt to each password, the hash generated is unique even for identical passwords, rendering precomputed tables ineffective. Secondly, salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without individually cracking their hashes. This is because different salts will inevitably result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical, thus enhancing user privacy and security."
Identify modern hashing algorithms that automatically incorporate salting.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This means that when these algorithms are used, no additional manual steps are required to implement salting, simplifying secure password storage practices. **Argon2id**, **bcrypt**, and **PBKDF2** (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) are all cryptographic key derivation functions designed to be computationally intensive, making brute-force attacks more difficult, and they inherently include salting as part of their design."
Explain the design philosophy behind modern password hashing algorithms.,"Modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed for securely storing passwords with a key characteristic: they should be slow. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family or KECCAK, which are optimized for speed, password hashing algorithms are intentionally designed to be computationally intensive. This slowness makes brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks significantly more time-consuming and therefore less feasible for attackers. The degree of slowness can often be configured by changing a parameter known as the **work factor**, which allows administrators to adjust the computational cost based on evolving hardware capabilities and security needs."
Discuss the significance of Argon2 in the context of password hashing.,"Argon2 holds significant importance in password hashing as it was the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. This recognition highlights its robust design and effectiveness for securely storing passwords. Its design prioritizes resistance against various attacks, including GPU-based cracking and side-channel attacks. For password storage, Argon2 is considered the primary recommendation due to its superior security properties demonstrated in the competition."
When should bcrypt be considered for password storage?,"The bcrypt password hashing function should be considered as the second choice for password storage, specifically if Argon2 is not available or cannot be implemented. **bcrypt** is a password hashing function based on the Blowfish cipher, designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks, and it incorporates a work factor to adjust its computational cost. While Argon2 is the preferred modern standard, bcrypt remains a strong and widely respected alternative for secure password storage."
"Analyze the challenges associated with enforcing strict password policies, such as long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords.","Enforcing strict password policies, such as requiring users to use long, complex passwords mixing upper and lower case characters with numerical symbols, system-generated passwords, and frequent changes, presents several challenges. Firstly, users may experience difficulty memorizing complex passwords, leading to frustration and potentially insecure coping mechanisms. Secondly, users may struggle with the burden of frequent password changes, which can also lead to poor password hygiene. Lastly, users might find ways of re-using their favorite passwords across different systems or modifying them predictably, undermining the intended security benefits. These issues can inadvertently lead to users adopting less secure practices, such as writing down passwords."
What are the security implications of users writing down their passwords?,"The security implications of users writing down their passwords, particularly on a piece of paper kept close to the computer, are significant and negative. This practice directly compromises the confidentiality of the password. If an attacker gains physical access to the user's immediate environment, they can easily discover the password without needing to resort to digital cracking methods. This bypasses all digital security measures, such as hashing and salting, making the account highly vulnerable to unauthorized access."
Explain the fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account.,"Setting a password for a user account is fundamentally important because, without one, an attacker does not even have to guess it. An account without a password provides an open door for unauthorized access, allowing any individual to gain control of the account and its associated resources instantly. This completely negates any security measures and leaves the system entirely vulnerable."
Discuss the risks associated with default passwords in system accounts.,"Default passwords in system accounts pose significant security risks. Often, system accounts come with widely known default values, such as 'manager'. While these defaults can be convenient for field engineers installing the system, if they are left unchanged, they become an easy target for attackers. Attackers can exploit these well-known default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially compromising its integrity and confidentiality. Therefore, changing default passwords immediately after installation is a critical security practice."
What are the key recommendations for avoiding guessable passwords?,"To avoid guessable passwords, several key recommendations should be followed. Firstly, prescribe a minimal password length to increase the complexity and search space for attackers. Secondly, enforce a specific password format that requires a mix of upper and lower case characters (making it **case-sensitive**), and the inclusion of numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols (making it **alphanumeric**). **Case-sensitive** means that 'Password' is treated differently from 'password'. **Alphanumeric** refers to characters that are either alphabetic letters or numerical digits. Lastly, it's important to acknowledge that today, online dictionaries for almost every language exist, which attackers can use for dictionary attacks. Therefore, passwords should not be simple words found in dictionaries."
Analyze the purpose and mechanisms of password ageing.,"Password ageing is a security policy designed to enhance security by regularly forcing users to change their passwords. Its primary purpose is to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker who might have compromised an old password. The mechanisms involved include setting expiry dates for passwords, which prompts users to create new ones after a certain period. Additionally, password ageing policies often prevent users from reverting to old passwords by keeping a history, such as a list of the last 'ten' passwords used, ensuring that new passwords are truly distinct and not just recycled previous ones."
Explain how limiting login attempts contributes to password security.,"Limiting login attempts is a crucial security measure that protects against brute-force attacks, where an attacker repeatedly tries different passwords until the correct one is found. The system monitors unsuccessful login attempts. Upon detecting a certain number of failed attempts within a specified timeframe, the system reacts by locking the user account. This lock can be either complete (requiring administrative intervention to unlock) or for a given time interval. This mechanism effectively prevents or discourages further automated attempts to guess passwords, significantly slowing down or stopping an attacker."
Describe the importance of informing users about recent login activity.,"Informing users about recent login activity is an important security practice that helps users detect and react to potential unauthorized access. After a successful login, the system should display the time of the last successful login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This information serves as a warning to the user about recently attempted attacks. If a user sees an unfamiliar last login time or a high number of failed attempts, they can be alerted to a potential compromise and take immediate action, such as changing their password or reporting suspicious activity."
What are the alternative forms of passwords mentioned in the document?,"The document outlines several alternative forms of passwords beyond traditional text-based ones. These include: \n1. **Passphrase**: Users enter sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember, and the system applies a hash function to compute the (fixed-size) actual passwords. \n2. **Visual drawing patterns**: These are used on touch interfaces, commonly seen in systems like Android, where users draw a specific pattern to unlock. \n3. **Picture passwords**: Users select objects in pictures and patterns, a method that was used in Windows 8. \n4. **One-time passwords**: These are passwords that are valid for only one login session or transaction, providing enhanced security by preventing replay attacks."
Analyze the role of the operating system in managing password files and the associated risks.,"The operating system plays a critical role in maintaining a file that stores user names and their corresponding passwords. This **password file** is a central component of user authentication. However, this file is also a prime target for attackers. An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of this password file. **Confidentiality** refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning an attacker could steal the password hashes. **Integrity** refers to preventing unauthorized modification of information, meaning an attacker could alter password hashes or user accounts. Protecting this file is paramount to overall system security."
Detail the options available for protecting the password file.,"There are several options for protecting the password file, which is crucial for maintaining system security. These options include: \n1. **Cryptographic protection**: This involves encrypting the password file or, more commonly, storing password hashes rather than plain-text passwords, often combined with salting. \n2. **Access control enforced by the operating system**: This involves setting strict permissions on the password file, limiting who can read or modify it to authorized system processes and administrators. **Access control** refers to mechanisms that restrict access to resources based on user identity or group membership. \n3. **Combination of cryptographic protection and access control**: This approach leverages both encryption/hashing and strict permissions, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks, providing a layered defense against compromise."
Explain how a salt makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder.,"A salt makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because it ensures that each password's hash is unique, even if the underlying passwords are the same. Since the salt is unique for every user, an attacker cannot pre-compute a single hash for a common password and compare it against all stored hashes. Instead, the attacker is forced to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each user. This means the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making it computationally infeasible to crack a large database of salted hashes efficiently."
What is the 'work factor' in the context of password hashing algorithms?,"The 'work factor' in the context of password hashing algorithms refers to a configurable parameter that determines how computationally intensive or 'slow' the hashing process will be. Modern hashing algorithms designed for password storage, unlike fast cryptographic hashes, are intentionally slow to deter brute-force attacks. By changing the work factor, administrators can adjust the amount of computational effort required to compute a hash. Increasing the work factor makes the hashing process slower, thereby increasing the time and resources an attacker would need to crack passwords, even with powerful hardware."
Describe the characteristics of a passphrase as an alternative form of password.,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password characterized by being a sentence or a long phrase. The key advantage of passphrases is that they are generally easier for users to remember compared to complex, randomly generated strings, while still offering significant length and complexity. When a user enters a passphrase, the system applies a hash function to compute the actual password, which is typically a fixed-size output. This method combines user-friendliness with cryptographic strength, as the length of the phrase contributes to its entropy."
How do visual drawing patterns function as an alternative password method?,"Visual drawing patterns function as an alternative password method primarily on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Instead of typing a sequence of characters, users unlock their devices or access accounts by drawing a specific pattern or sequence of gestures on a grid of points. This method leverages spatial memory and motor skills rather than alphanumeric recall. The security of visual drawing patterns depends on the complexity and uniqueness of the drawn pattern, as well as the underlying system's implementation of pattern recognition and storage."
Explain the concept of picture passwords and where they were used.,"Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select specific objects or patterns within a chosen picture to log in. Instead of typing a password, the user interacts with an image by tapping or drawing gestures on predefined points or areas. This method was notably used in Windows 8. The security relies on the user remembering the specific picture, the sequence of interactions, and the precise locations or gestures, making it a visual and interactive form of authentication."
What is a one-time password and what is its primary benefit?,"A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for only a single login session or transaction. Its primary benefit is enhanced security because, even if an attacker intercepts an OTP, it cannot be reused for subsequent access. This makes OTPs highly resistant to replay attacks, where an attacker captures valid authentication credentials and attempts to use them again. OTPs are often generated by a token (hardware or software) and are time-sensitive or event-sensitive."
How does salting protect against pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables?,"Salting protects against pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables by ensuring that the hash generated for a password is unique to each user, even if multiple users share the same password. A **rainbow table** is a precomputed table of hashes designed to reverse cryptographic hash functions. Without salting, a common password would always produce the same hash, allowing an attacker to look up that hash in a rainbow table to find the original password. By adding a unique, randomly generated salt to each password before hashing, the resulting hash is different for every user, rendering generic rainbow tables ineffective. An attacker would need to generate a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value, which is computationally infeasible."
Why is it impossible to determine if two users have the same password when salting is used?,"It is impossible to determine if two users have the same password when salting is used because each user's password is combined with a unique, randomly generated salt before being hashed. Even if two users choose the exact same password, the different salts applied to each password will result in completely different hash values. Therefore, by simply comparing the stored hash values, one cannot infer whether the original passwords were identical, as the hashes will always appear distinct. This enhances privacy and prevents attackers from identifying common passwords across a user base."
What are the primary functions of a password policy regarding default passwords?,"The primary functions of a password policy regarding default passwords are to mitigate the significant security risks they pose. Default passwords, often simple and widely known (e.g., 'manager'), are convenient for initial system setup by field engineers but become a major vulnerability if left unchanged. A robust password policy mandates that all default passwords for system accounts must be changed immediately upon installation. This prevents attackers from easily breaking into systems using publicly available or commonly guessed default credentials, thereby securing the system from an initial point of compromise."
How do online dictionaries pose a threat to password security?,"Online dictionaries pose a significant threat to password security because they provide attackers with vast lists of common words and phrases that users often choose as passwords. Attackers can perform **dictionary attacks**, where they systematically try every word in an online dictionary (which exists for almost every language) against a user's account or a database of stolen password hashes. If users select passwords that are simple dictionary words, these attacks can quickly succeed, compromising accounts. This highlights the importance of password policies that enforce complexity requirements beyond simple dictionary words."
Detail the methods for protecting a password file.,"Protecting the password file, which contains user names and their associated passwords (typically in hashed form), is critical. The methods for protection include: \n1. **Cryptographic protection**: This involves using strong hashing algorithms (like Argon2id, bcrypt, PBKDF2) with salting to store passwords, ensuring that even if the file is accessed, the original passwords are not directly exposed. Encryption of the entire file can also be used. \n2. **Access control enforced by the operating system**: The operating system must implement strict permissions on the password file, limiting read and write access exclusively to authorized system processes and administrators. This prevents unauthorized users or applications from even viewing the hashed passwords. \n3. **Combination of cryptographic protection and access control**: This layered approach provides the strongest defense. It combines the security of strong hashing and encryption with strict access permissions. Additionally, further measures can be implemented to slow down dictionary attacks, such as rate limiting access to the file or increasing the computational cost of hashing."
What is the role of the operating system in maintaining password files?,"The operating system's role in maintaining password files is to store and manage user names and their corresponding passwords (or more accurately, password hashes). It is responsible for creating, updating, and securely accessing this file during the authentication process. The operating system also enforces access control mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this file, ensuring that only authorized processes can read or modify its contents. This central management by the OS is fundamental to user authentication and overall system security."
What are the different categories of alternative password forms mentioned?,"The document mentions four distinct categories of alternative password forms: \n1. **Passphrases**: These involve using sentences or long phrases that are easy for users to remember. \n2. **Visual drawing patterns**: These are patterns drawn on a touch interface, commonly used on mobile devices. \n3. **Picture passwords**: These require users to select specific objects or patterns within a chosen image. \n4. **One-time passwords**: These are credentials that are valid for only a single login session or transaction."
Explain why modern hashing algorithms for passwords should be slow.,"Modern hashing algorithms for passwords should be slow because this characteristic is a deliberate design choice to enhance security against brute-force and dictionary attacks. If a hashing algorithm were fast, an attacker could test billions of password guesses per second, even with modest hardware. By making the hashing process computationally intensive and slow (configurable via a **work factor**), the time and resources required for an attacker to test a large number of passwords become prohibitively high. This significantly increases the cost and time for an attacker to crack passwords, making such attacks less feasible and protecting user accounts more effectively."
What are the implications if an attacker can pre-compute hashes?,"If an attacker can pre-compute hashes, it has severe implications for password security. Pre-computation, often done using **rainbow tables** or large databases of common password hashes, allows an attacker to quickly find the original password corresponding to a stolen hash without needing to perform real-time computations for each guess. This drastically reduces the time and effort required for cracking, making a large number of accounts vulnerable simultaneously. Salting is the primary defense against this, as it makes pre-computation impractical by ensuring each hash is unique."
How does the 'work factor' in password hashing algorithms contribute to security?,"The 'work factor' in password hashing algorithms directly contributes to security by allowing the computational cost of hashing to be adjusted. By increasing the work factor, the algorithm is made intentionally slower, requiring more processing power and time to compute a hash. This increased computational burden makes brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks significantly more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker. As computing power advances, the work factor can be increased to maintain a desired level of resistance against cracking, ensuring that the algorithm remains secure over time without needing a complete redesign."
What is the primary difference between modern password hashing algorithms and crypto hashes like SHA family?,"The primary difference between modern password hashing algorithms (like Argon2id, bcrypt, PBKDF2) and crypto hashes such as the SHA family (e.g., SHA-256) or KECCAK lies in their design goal regarding speed. Crypto hashes like SHA are designed to be fast and efficient for general-purpose data integrity and digital signatures. In contrast, modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed to be slow and computationally intensive. This intentional slowness, often configurable via a **work factor**, is a security feature that makes brute-force and dictionary attacks against passwords much harder and more time-consuming for attackers, unlike fast hashes which would be easily crackable for passwords."
Discuss the security benefits of preventing users from reverting to old passwords.,"Preventing users from reverting to old passwords is a significant security benefit within a password ageing policy. If users could simply reuse a recently expired password, the effectiveness of forcing regular changes would be negated. An attacker who compromises a password would still have access even after the user 'changes' it back to the old one. By maintaining a history (e.g., a list of the last 'ten' passwords used) and disallowing reuse, the policy ensures that new passwords are truly distinct. This forces users to create genuinely new credentials, reducing the risk of an attacker maintaining access with a previously compromised password."
How does the system react to unsuccessful login attempts to enhance security?,"To enhance security, the system reacts to unsuccessful login attempts by monitoring their frequency. If a certain threshold of failed attempts is reached within a specified period, the system will take action to prevent or discourage further attempts. This reaction typically involves locking the user account. The lock can be either complete, requiring an administrator to manually unlock it, or for a given time interval, after which the user can try again. This mechanism is crucial for thwarting brute-force attacks by making it impractical for attackers to systematically guess passwords."
What specific information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to warn about attempted attacks?,"After a successful login, to warn the user about recently attempted attacks, the system should specifically display two pieces of information: the time of the last successful login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This allows the user to quickly identify any suspicious activity. For example, if the user sees a last login time that doesn't match their own activity or a high count of failed attempts, they are immediately alerted to a potential compromise or an ongoing attack, prompting them to take protective measures."
What are the implications of users having difficulty memorizing complex passwords?,"Users having difficulty memorizing complex passwords has several negative implications for security. When passwords are too complex to remember, users may resort to insecure practices such as writing them down on physical notes (e.g., on paper kept near the computer), storing them in unencrypted digital files, or using predictable patterns to generate them. These actions undermine the very purpose of complex passwords by creating new vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited by attackers, effectively bypassing the intended security benefits of complexity."
Discuss the impact of frequent password changes on user behavior and security.,"Frequent password changes, while seemingly a good security practice, can have a negative impact on user behavior and overall security. Users may find it difficult to deal with the constant need to create and remember new passwords. This often leads to users choosing simpler, more guessable passwords, or adopting predictable patterns for their new passwords (e.g., incrementing a number or changing a single character). They might also reuse old passwords or write them down. These behaviors ultimately reduce the actual security posture, as the 'new' passwords are often weaker or easily discoverable, making the system more vulnerable despite the policy."
How does user re-using their favorite password pose a security risk?,"User re-using their favorite password poses a significant security risk because if that single password is compromised on one service, an attacker can then use it to gain unauthorized access to all other accounts where the user has reused it. This is a common vulnerability known as **credential stuffing**. Even if other services have strong security measures, the reuse of a password creates a single point of failure. This risk is exacerbated when users are forced into strict password policies that make remembering unique passwords difficult, leading them to fall back on familiar, reused credentials."
What is the definition of a 'salt' in password storage?,"A **salt** in password storage is defined as a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This string is distinct for every user. Its purpose is to ensure that even if two users have the same password, the resulting hash stored in the system will be different due to the unique salt appended to each. This significantly enhances security by making pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables ineffective and by preventing the determination of identical passwords across users."
Explain the term 'case-sensitive' in the context of password format.,"In the context of password format, 'case-sensitive' means that the system distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, if a password is 'Password123', entering 'password123' or 'PASSWORD123' would be considered incorrect. This requirement increases the complexity and the number of possible combinations for a password, thereby making it harder for attackers to guess or brute-force, as they must account for both cases for each letter."
What does 'alphanumeric' mean when describing password format requirements?,"When describing password format requirements, 'alphanumeric' means that the password must include characters that are either alphabetic letters (A-Z, a-z) or numerical digits (0-9). This requirement ensures a basic level of complexity by combining two different character sets. Often, password policies further extend this to include non-alphabetical symbols (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.) to increase the entropy and strength of the password even more, making it harder to guess or crack."
How does cryptographic protection secure a password file?,"Cryptographic protection secures a password file primarily by transforming the sensitive data within it into an unreadable format, making it unintelligible to unauthorized parties. In the context of passwords, this typically involves storing password hashes (generated using strong, slow hashing algorithms like Argon2id with unique salts) rather than plain-text passwords. Even if an attacker gains access to the password file, they only obtain these hashes, which are computationally difficult to reverse engineer into original passwords. Additionally, the entire password file itself could be encrypted, adding another layer of defense against unauthorized disclosure."
What is the role of access control in protecting the password file?,"Access control plays a critical role in protecting the password file by restricting who or what can interact with it. Enforced by the operating system, **access control** mechanisms define permissions that specify which users, groups, or processes are authorized to read, write, or execute operations on the password file. By setting strict access controls, unauthorized users or malicious software are prevented from accessing or tampering with the file, even if they are present on the system. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the stored password information by limiting its exposure to only necessary and trusted entities."
Describe the combined approach to protecting the password file.,"The combined approach to protecting the password file involves leveraging both cryptographic protection and access control, often with additional measures. This layered security strategy offers the strongest defense. **Cryptographic protection** ensures that even if the file's contents are accessed, the passwords (stored as salted hashes) are not immediately usable. **Access control**, enforced by the operating system, restricts unauthorized entities from even reaching the file. Furthermore, this combination can include additional measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks, such as increasing the computational cost of hashing or implementing rate limiting on authentication attempts, creating a robust defense against various attack vectors."
What is the primary goal of modern hashing algorithms for password storage?,"The primary goal of modern hashing algorithms for password storage is to securely store passwords in a way that makes them extremely difficult and time-consuming for attackers to crack, even if the hashed password database is compromised. This is achieved by designing the algorithms to be intentionally slow and computationally intensive (configurable via a **work factor**), unlike fast cryptographic hashes. They also incorporate **salting** automatically to prevent pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables and ensure unique hashes for identical passwords, thereby maximizing resistance against brute-force and dictionary attacks."
How does salting contribute to preventing database-based lookups for pre-computed hashes?,"Salting contributes to preventing database-based lookups for pre-computed hashes by ensuring that each password's hash is unique to the user. An attacker might try to build a database of common passwords and their corresponding hashes. However, because a unique, randomly generated salt is added to each password before hashing, the resulting hash for a given password will be different for every user. This means an attacker cannot simply look up a stolen hash in a generic database of pre-computed hashes to find the original password, as the specific salt used would not be accounted for in such a generic database. This forces attackers to crack each hash individually, significantly increasing their effort."
What is the main advantage of a passphrase over a traditional short password?,"The main advantage of a passphrase over a traditional short password is that it allows users to create a much longer and more complex credential that is simultaneously easier to remember. While traditional passwords often rely on a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols in a short string, which can be hard to recall, a passphrase uses a sentence or a long phrase. This length significantly increases the entropy and resistance to brute-force attacks, while the natural language structure makes it more memorable for the user, combining strong security with usability."
Why is it important for modern password hashing algorithms to be configurable via a 'work factor'?,"It is important for modern password hashing algorithms to be configurable via a 'work factor' because computing power continuously increases over time. An algorithm that is sufficiently slow today might become too fast and vulnerable to brute-force attacks with future hardware advancements. The **work factor** allows administrators to adjust the computational cost of the hashing process. By increasing the work factor periodically, the algorithm's resistance to cracking can be maintained or even enhanced without needing to change the algorithm itself, ensuring long-term security against evolving attacker capabilities."
What are the potential drawbacks of doing without default passwords entirely?,"The document raises the question, 'Would it then be better to do without default passwords?' While the document doesn't explicitly state drawbacks, it implies that default passwords help field engineers installing the system. Therefore, a potential drawback of doing without default passwords entirely could be increased complexity or time required for initial system setup and configuration. Without a pre-set credential, even a temporary one, the initial access and configuration process for legitimate installers might become more cumbersome, potentially requiring alternative secure provisioning methods."
How does the concept of 'time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes' relate to salting?,"The concept of 'time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes' directly relates to salting because salting forces an attacker to process each hash individually. Since each password is combined with a unique salt before hashing, every stored hash is distinct. An attacker cannot compute a single hash for a common password and compare it against a large batch of stored hashes. Instead, for each hash they want to crack, they must perform the hashing operation with the specific salt associated with that hash. This means that cracking 100 hashes will take approximately 100 times longer than cracking a single hash, making large-scale attacks computationally prohibitive."
What is the primary security benefit of password ageing?,"The primary security benefit of password ageing is to limit the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password. By forcing users to change passwords regularly, even if an attacker manages to obtain a password, its validity period is limited. This reduces the time an attacker can use the compromised credential for unauthorized access. Additionally, by preventing reuse of old passwords, it ensures that new passwords are genuinely new, further enhancing security."
Why are modern hashing algorithms for passwords specifically designed to be slow?,"Modern hashing algorithms for passwords are specifically designed to be slow to make brute-force and dictionary attacks computationally infeasible for attackers. Unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes that prioritize speed, password hashes intentionally introduce a significant delay in computation. This delay, often controlled by a **work factor**, means that an attacker attempting to guess passwords would need an extremely long time and immense computational resources to test a large number of possibilities, thereby protecting user accounts from rapid, automated cracking attempts."
What is the main purpose of limiting login attempts?,"The main purpose of limiting login attempts is to prevent or discourage brute-force attacks against user accounts. A **brute-force attack** involves an attacker systematically trying every possible password combination until the correct one is found. By monitoring unsuccessful login attempts and reacting by locking the user account (either completely or for a given time interval) after a certain number of failures, the system significantly slows down or completely stops these automated guessing attempts, making the attack impractical and protecting the account from unauthorized access."
How does displaying the time of last login enhance security?,"Displaying the time of last login after a successful login enhances security by providing the user with a simple and immediate way to detect unauthorized access. If the user sees a last login time that does not correspond to their own activity, it serves as a clear warning sign that their account may have been compromised. This prompt notification allows the user to take immediate action, such as changing their password, reviewing account activity, or reporting the suspicious login to administrators, thereby mitigating potential damage from an attacker."
What is the significance of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition for password storage choices?,"The 2015 Password Hashing Competition holds significant importance for password storage choices because it provided a rigorous evaluation of various password hashing algorithms, leading to the selection of Argon2 as the winner. This competition helped establish a modern standard for secure password hashing, guiding developers and security professionals towards algorithms that are robust against current and anticipated attack methods. The outcome of the competition directly influences recommendations, positioning Argon2 as the preferred choice and bcrypt as a strong second alternative, based on their demonstrated security properties."
