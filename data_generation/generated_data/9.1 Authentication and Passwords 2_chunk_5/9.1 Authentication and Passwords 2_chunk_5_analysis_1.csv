Define salting in the context of password storage.,"Salting is the process where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This salt is unique for every user, making it significantly harder for an attacker to crack large numbers of hashes, as they would have to crack them one at a time using the respective salt, rather than pre-computing a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. The time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Explain how salting makes cracking large numbers of password hashes more difficult.,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of password hashes significantly harder because a unique, randomly generated string, called a salt, is added to each password before hashing. Since this salt is unique for every user, an attacker cannot pre-compute hashes or use rainbow tables. Instead, they are forced to crack hashes one at a time, using the specific salt associated with each user's password. This increases the time required for cracking in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks impractical."
How does salting protect against pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables?,"Salting protects against pre-computation attacks, such as those using rainbow tables or database-based lookups, by adding a unique, randomly generated string (a salt) to each password before it is hashed. Because the salt is unique for every user, even if two users have the same password, their salted hashes will be different. This prevents an attacker from pre-computing a large table of common password hashes (a rainbow table) and using it to quickly find matches for many stored hashes, as each hash would require a unique salt to be considered."
Discuss the role of salting in preventing the determination of identical passwords among users.,"Salting plays a crucial role in preventing the determination of whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is achieved because a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password before hashing. Consequently, even if two users happen to choose the exact same password, the different salts applied to their passwords will result in distinct hash values. This makes it impossible for an attacker to simply compare hash values to identify users with identical passwords."
"Which modern hashing algorithms automatically incorporate salting, and what is the implication of this?","Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically incorporate salting into their process. The implication of this automatic salting is that no additional steps are required from the user or developer to add a salt when using these algorithms for password storage. This simplifies secure password implementation while still benefiting from the enhanced security provided by salting, which involves adding a unique, randomly generated string to each password before hashing."
What is the primary design goal for modern hashing algorithms used for securely storing passwords?,"The primary design goal for modern hashing algorithms used for securely storing passwords is to be slow. Unlike cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family and KECCAK, which are designed for speed, password hashing algorithms are intentionally made computationally intensive. This slowness makes brute-force attacks and other cracking attempts significantly more time-consuming and therefore less feasible for attackers. The degree of slowness can often be configured by adjusting a parameter known as the work factor."
Define 'work factor' in the context of password hashing algorithms.,"The 'work factor' is a configurable parameter in modern password hashing algorithms that determines how slow the hashing process will be. By changing the work factor, the computational intensity and thus the time required to compute a hash can be adjusted. A higher work factor increases the time needed to calculate a hash, making brute-force attacks more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker, thereby enhancing security."
What is the significance of Argon2 in the realm of password hashing algorithms?,"Argon2 is significant because it was the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. This recognition highlights its robust design and effectiveness for securely storing passwords. It is a modern hashing algorithm specifically engineered to be slow and resistant to various attacks, making it a highly recommended choice for password storage."
When should bcrypt be considered for password storage?,"bcrypt should be considered as the second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available. Argon2 is generally recommended as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, but bcrypt is also a modern and robust password hashing function designed to be slow and secure, making it a strong alternative when Argon2 cannot be implemented."
"Analyze the user difficulties associated with memorizing complex, system-generated passwords.","Users may experience significant difficulty memorizing complex passwords, especially those that are long, mix upper and lower case characters, include numerical symbols, and are generated for them by the system. Such complexity, while intended to enhance security, can lead to users struggling to recall their credentials, potentially resulting in them writing down passwords or seeking less secure methods to manage them."
Examine the challenges users face with frequent password changes.,"Users may have difficulty dealing with frequent password changes. While intended to improve security by reducing the window of opportunity for compromised passwords, forcing users to change passwords too often can lead to frustration, forgotten passwords, or the adoption of predictable patterns for new passwords, such as simply incrementing a number or changing a single character, which undermines the security benefit."
"What issues arise when users are forced to use complex passwords and change them repeatedly, regarding password re-use?","When users are forced to use long, complex, system-generated passwords and change them repeatedly, they may find ways of re-using their favorite password. This behavior, driven by the difficulty of memorizing new complex passwords, defeats the purpose of frequent changes and complex requirements, as a compromised 'favorite' password could then be used across multiple accounts, negating the security benefits of the policy."
"Is it always a bad idea to write down your password, and why?","Yes, it is generally a bad idea to write down your password, especially if kept close to the computer. The risk is that if an attacker gains physical access to the computer or its immediate vicinity, they can easily find the written password, thereby compromising the account without needing to guess or crack it. This bypasses all digital security measures designed to protect the password."
Explain the fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account.,"Setting a password for a user account is fundamentally important because if there is no password, an attacker does not even have to guess it. They can simply gain unauthorized access to the account without any impediment. A password acts as the first line of defense, requiring authentication before access is granted, thereby protecting the account from immediate, unhindered intrusion."
Analyze the security risk associated with leaving default passwords unchanged.,"Leaving default passwords unchanged poses a significant security risk. Often, system accounts come with default values, such as ""manager"", which are widely known or easily guessable. These default passwords are helpful for field engineers installing the system, but if left unchanged, they make it extremely easy for an attacker to break into the system. Attackers can exploit these known defaults to gain unauthorized access, compromising the system's security."
What is a key policy recommendation for avoiding guessable passwords related to length?,"A key policy recommendation for avoiding guessable passwords is to prescribe a minimal password length. By enforcing a minimum length, passwords become inherently more complex and harder to guess or brute-force. Shorter passwords have a smaller keyspace, making them more susceptible to dictionary attacks or brute-force attempts, whereas longer passwords significantly increase the time and computational resources required for an attacker."
"Describe the recommended password format for creating strong, unguessable passwords.","The recommended password format for creating strong, unguessable passwords involves mixing upper and lower case characters (making it case-sensitive), including numerical symbols, and incorporating other non-alphabetical symbols. This combination, often referred to as alphanumeric and special characters, significantly increases the complexity and entropy of a password, making it much harder for attackers to guess or crack using dictionary attacks or brute-force methods."
How do online dictionaries relate to the policy of avoiding guessable passwords?,"Online dictionaries relate to the policy of avoiding guessable passwords because today, dictionaries for almost every language exist and are readily available to attackers. This means that if users choose common words or phrases as passwords, these can be easily compromised through dictionary attacks, where an attacker tries every word in a dictionary. Therefore, password policies must enforce complexity requirements (mixing cases, numbers, symbols) to ensure passwords are not simple dictionary words and are resistant to such attacks."
Explain the concept of password ageing through expiry dates.,"Password ageing, specifically through setting expiry dates for passwords, is a policy designed to force users to change their passwords regularly. This means that after a certain period, a user's current password will no longer be valid, and they will be prompted to create a new one. The purpose is to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password, as its validity period is limited."
How does password ageing prevent users from reverting to old passwords?,"Password ageing prevents users from reverting to old passwords by implementing a mechanism that keeps a list of previously used passwords, for example, the last ""ten"" passwords. When a user is required to change their password due to an expiry date, the system checks the new password against this list. If the new password matches one of the recently used passwords, the system rejects it, forcing the user to create a truly new and distinct password, thereby enhancing security."
Describe the mechanism and purpose of a 'limit login attempts' policy.,"A 'limit login attempts' policy involves the system monitoring unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain number of failed attempts occur within a specified timeframe, the system reacts by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. The purpose of this mechanism is to prevent or discourage further attempts by an attacker who might be trying to guess a password through brute-force or dictionary attacks, thereby protecting the account from unauthorized access."
"What information should be displayed to a user after a successful login, and why?","After a successful login, the system should display the time of the user's last login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This information serves to warn the user about recently attempted attacks. If the user sees an unfamiliar last login time or a high number of failed attempts, it indicates that someone else might be trying to access their account, prompting them to take action, such as changing their password or reporting suspicious activity."
Define a passphrase and explain how it functions as an alternative form of password.,"A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are typically easier to remember than complex, random character strings. The system then applies a hash function to this passphrase to compute the actual password, which is of a fixed size. This method leverages human memory for longer, more memorable inputs while still generating a cryptographically secure, fixed-size credential for system authentication."
"What are visual drawing patterns as an alternative password form, and where are they commonly used?","Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password that involves a user drawing a specific pattern on a touch interface. This pattern, rather than a sequence of characters, serves as the authentication credential. They are commonly used in mobile operating systems, such as Android, providing a graphical and often more intuitive method for unlocking devices compared to traditional alphanumeric passwords."
Explain what picture passwords are and where they have been utilized.,"Picture passwords are an alternative form of password where users select specific objects in pictures and patterns to authenticate. Instead of typing characters, the user interacts with an image by tapping or drawing on designated areas in a particular sequence. This method was utilized in Windows 8, offering a more visual and potentially easier-to-remember authentication experience."
Briefly describe one-time passwords.,"One-time passwords (OTPs) are an alternative form of password that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short period. This enhances security by ensuring that even if an OTP is intercepted, it cannot be re-used for subsequent unauthorized access."
What information does the operating system maintain in a password file?,"The operating system maintains a file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords. This file is critical for user authentication, as it stores the necessary credentials that the system uses to verify a user's identity during login."
What is an attacker's primary objective concerning the password file?,"An attacker's primary objective concerning the password file is to compromise its confidentiality or integrity. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the usernames and passwords stored within, potentially allowing them to impersonate users. Compromising integrity means altering the data in the file, which could lead to unauthorized access or denial of service."
How can cryptographic protection be applied to secure the password file?,"Cryptographic protection can be applied to secure the password file by encrypting its contents. This means that the usernames and passwords stored within the file are transformed into an unreadable format using an encryption algorithm and a key. Even if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the file, they would not be able to read the sensitive information without the decryption key, thus protecting its confidentiality."
Explain how access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file.,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by restricting who can read, write, or execute the file. The operating system sets permissions that dictate which users or processes have authorized access to the password file. This prevents unauthorized users or malicious software from directly accessing or modifying the file, thereby safeguarding its confidentiality and integrity."
Describe a comprehensive approach to protecting the password file that combines multiple measures.,"A comprehensive approach to protecting the password file involves a combination of cryptographic protection and access control. Cryptographic protection encrypts the file's contents, making it unreadable without the correct key, while access control enforced by the operating system restricts who can access the file itself. Additionally, this combined approach can include further measures specifically designed to slow down dictionary attacks, adding another layer of defense against brute-force attempts to crack passwords within the file."
"Why is it important for modern password hashing algorithms to be slow, unlike crypto hashes?","It is important for modern password hashing algorithms to be slow because this characteristic significantly increases the computational cost and time required for an attacker to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks. Unlike crypto hashes (such as SHA family & KECCAK) which are designed to be fast for data integrity checks, password hashes are intentionally made slow to deter attackers from quickly testing a large number of password guesses, thereby enhancing the security of stored passwords."
Which algorithm won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,Argon2 is the algorithm that won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
"Considering the risks of default passwords, would it be better to do without them entirely?","While default passwords, such as ""manager"", are helpful for field engineers installing a system, leaving them unchanged makes it easy for an attacker to break in. Therefore, it is crucial to change them immediately rather than relying on their absence, as their initial presence facilitates system setup but becomes a severe vulnerability if not updated."
What role does case-sensitivity play in password format policies?,"Case-sensitivity plays a crucial role in password format policies by requiring users to mix upper and lower case characters. This significantly increases the number of possible character combinations for a given password length, making it much harder for attackers to guess or brute-force the password. For example, 'Password' is distinct from 'password' or 'PASSWORD' in a case-sensitive system, expanding the search space for an attacker."
What is the most basic and essential password policy regarding user accounts?,"The most basic and essential password policy regarding user accounts is to set a password. If no password is set for a user account, an attacker does not even have to guess it, gaining immediate and unrestricted access. A password serves as the fundamental barrier to unauthorized entry."
Why is it critical to change default passwords on system accounts?,"It is critical to change default passwords on system accounts because these often have well-known default values, such as ""manager"". While useful for field engineers during installation, if these default passwords are left unchanged, they provide an easy entry point for attackers, allowing them to break into the system without needing to guess complex credentials."
What is the overarching goal of the 'Avoid guessable passwords' policy?,"The overarching goal of the 'Avoid guessable passwords' policy is to ensure that passwords are not easily discoverable through common attack methods like dictionary attacks or simple guessing. This is achieved by prescribing a minimal password length and enforcing a complex password format that includes a mix of upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols, making them resistant to readily available online dictionaries."
What are the two main components of a 'password ageing' policy?,"The two main components of a 'password ageing' policy are setting expiry dates for passwords to force users to change them regularly, and preventing users from reverting to old passwords by keeping a list of previously used ones (e.g., the last ""ten"" passwords). These measures ensure that passwords are not used indefinitely and that new passwords are truly distinct from recent ones, enhancing security."
How does limiting login attempts contribute to password security?,"Limiting login attempts contributes to password security by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts and reacting by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval. This mechanism prevents or discourages brute-force attacks and other automated guessing attempts by making it computationally expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to try multiple password combinations."
What is the security benefit of informing the user about their last login and failed attempts?,"The security benefit of informing the user about their last login time and the number of failed login attempts since their last successful login is to warn them about recently attempted attacks. This allows users to detect suspicious activity on their account, such as unauthorized login attempts, and take appropriate action, like changing their password or contacting support, thereby acting as an early warning system."
Compare modern password hashing algorithms with crypto hashes like SHA family and KECCAK in terms of their design philosophy.,"Modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed to be slow for securely storing passwords, with their slowness configurable via a work factor. This intentional slowness makes brute-force attacks computationally expensive. In contrast, crypto hashes like the SHA family and KECCAK are designed to be fast, primarily for purposes such as data integrity checks and digital signatures, where rapid computation is a desirable characteristic."
List examples of modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Examples of modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords include Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed to incorporate a unique, randomly generated string (a salt) into the hashing process without requiring additional manual steps from the user or developer."
What are the potential drawbacks if users are forced to use system-generated passwords?,"If users are forced to use system-generated passwords, a potential drawback is that they may have difficulty memorizing these complex passwords. System-generated passwords are often long and contain a mix of upper/lower case characters and numerical/special symbols, which, while secure, can be challenging for human recall, potentially leading to users writing them down or finding ways to re-use simpler, favorite passwords."
"Why is mixing upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols important for password security?","Mixing upper and lower case characters, numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols is important for password security because it significantly increases the complexity and entropy of a password. This expanded character set makes the password much harder to guess or crack through brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks, as the number of possible combinations an attacker must try grows exponentially with each added character type."
Differentiate between compromising the confidentiality and integrity of a password file.,"Compromising the confidentiality of a password file means an attacker gains unauthorized access to read the usernames and passwords stored within it. This allows them to view sensitive information. Compromising the integrity of a password file, on the other hand, means an attacker gains unauthorized ability to modify or alter the data within the file, potentially changing passwords or adding new user accounts, which can lead to unauthorized access or system disruption."
What additional measures can be combined with cryptographic protection and access control to slow down dictionary attacks on a password file?,"To slow down dictionary attacks on a password file, additional measures can be combined with cryptographic protection and access control. These measures typically involve using slow password hashing algorithms (like Argon2 or bcrypt) with a high work factor, which intentionally makes each hash computation time-consuming. This significantly increases the time and computational resources an attacker needs to test a large number of dictionary words against the stored hashes, making the attack less feasible."
"Which alternative form of password is commonly used on touch interfaces, such as Android devices?","Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password commonly used on touch interfaces, such as Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on the screen, which the system then uses to verify their identity."
What alternative password form was used in Windows 8?,"Picture passwords were an alternative password form used in Windows 8. This method involved users selecting specific objects in pictures and patterns to authenticate, offering a visual alternative to traditional text-based passwords."
Describe where in the hashing process a salt is added to a password.,"A salt is added to each password as part of the hashing process. Specifically, this unique, randomly generated string is concatenated with the password before the hashing algorithm is applied. The combined string (password + salt) is then fed into the hashing function to produce the final hash value, ensuring that even identical passwords result in different hashes due to their unique salts."
