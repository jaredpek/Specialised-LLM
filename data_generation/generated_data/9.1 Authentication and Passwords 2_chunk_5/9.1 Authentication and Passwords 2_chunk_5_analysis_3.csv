Define salting in the context of password storage and explain its fundamental mechanism.,"Salting is a security technique in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a **salt**, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. The **hashing process** transforms the password and salt into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash, which is stored instead of the original password. Because the salt is unique for every user, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This significantly increases the time required to crack large numbers of hashes, as the time grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
"Analyze the security benefits of salting passwords, particularly against common attack methods.","Salting passwords provides significant security benefits by making it harder for attackers to compromise stored hashes. Firstly, it protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using **rainbow tables** or database-based lookups. A **rainbow table** is a pre-computed table used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, typically for cracking passwords. By adding a unique salt to each password, the pre-computed hashes in a rainbow table become irrelevant. Secondly, salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, as an attacker must crack each hash individually with its unique salt. Finally, salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes, as different salts will result in different hashes even if the original passwords are identical."
"Which modern hashing algorithms automatically incorporate salting, and what does this imply for implementation?","Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This implies that no additional steps are required by the implementer to add a salt when using these algorithms, simplifying the secure storage of passwords."
"Explain why modern password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow, unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes.","Modern password hashing algorithms are specifically designed to be slow, unlike general-purpose cryptographic hashes such as SHA family and KECCAK which are designed to be fast. This slowness is a deliberate security feature. By making the hashing process computationally intensive, it significantly increases the time and resources an attacker needs to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks, even if they manage to obtain the hashed passwords. The slowness can be configured by changing the **work factor**, which is a parameter that controls the computational cost of the hashing function, allowing administrators to adjust the difficulty of cracking based on available computing power."
Define 'work factor' in the context of password hashing algorithms and its significance.,"The **work factor** is a configurable parameter in modern password hashing algorithms that determines how slow the hashing process will be. By changing the work factor, the computational cost of generating a hash can be adjusted. A higher work factor means the hashing process takes longer, which in turn makes it significantly harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to crack passwords through brute-force or dictionary attacks, even if they have access to the hashed passwords."
Identify the recommended modern password hashing algorithms according to the document.,"The document recommends Argon2 as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition for securely storing passwords. If Argon2 is not available, bcrypt should be considered the second choice for password storage."
Provide details about Argon2 as a password hashing algorithm.,"Argon2 is a modern password hashing algorithm that was the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. It is specifically designed for securely storing passwords and, like other modern algorithms, is intended to be slow to deter brute-force attacks. It automatically salts passwords, eliminating the need for additional steps during implementation."
Describe the role and recommendation for bcrypt in password storage.,"bcrypt is a password hashing function recommended as the second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available. Like Argon2, it is a modern hashing algorithm designed for securely storing passwords, meaning it is intentionally slow and automatically salts passwords to enhance security against various attacks."
"What are the primary challenges associated with enforcing highly secure password policies, such as requiring long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords?","Enforcing highly secure password policies, which mandate long passwords, mixing upper and lower case characters and numerical symbols, system generation, and repeated changes, presents several primary challenges for users. Users may experience difficulty memorizing complex passwords. They may also struggle with the frequent password changes required. Consequently, users might find ways to re-use their favorite password or resort to writing down their passwords, often on a piece of paper kept close to their computer, which can undermine the intended security."
Discuss the security implications of users writing down their passwords.,"When users are forced to use complex, system-generated, or frequently changed passwords, they may find it difficult to memorize them. This often leads to users writing down their passwords, for example, on a piece of paper kept close to their computer. This practice significantly compromises security, as it creates a physical vulnerability where an attacker could gain direct access to the password without needing to bypass digital security measures."
Explain the fundamental importance of setting a password for a user account.,"Setting a password for a user account is fundamentally important because if there is no password, an attacker does not even have to guess it. This means the account is completely unprotected and can be accessed by anyone, making it an immediate and severe security vulnerability."
Analyze the security risks associated with not changing default passwords on system accounts.,"Not changing default passwords on system accounts poses a significant security risk. Often, passwords for system accounts have common default values, such as ""manager"". While these default passwords help field engineers during system installation, if left unchanged, they make it easy for an attacker to break into the system. Attackers can exploit these well-known default credentials to gain unauthorized access, compromising the system's security."
What is a key recommendation for avoiding guessable passwords regarding password length?,"A key recommendation for avoiding guessable passwords is to prescribe a minimal password length. This policy ensures that users create passwords that are sufficiently long, making them harder to guess or crack through brute-force attacks, which try every possible combination of characters."
"Describe the recommended password format for creating strong, unguessable passwords.","The recommended password format for creating strong, unguessable passwords involves mixing upper and lower case characters, which is known as **case-sensitive** input, and including numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols. This combination of character types is often referred to as **alphanumeric** with special characters. Such a diverse character set significantly increases the complexity and entropy of a password, making it much harder for attackers to guess or crack."
How do online dictionaries impact the security of guessable passwords?,"Online dictionaries significantly impact the security of guessable passwords because today, on-line dictionaries for almost every language exist. Attackers can use these dictionaries in **dictionary attacks**, which involve trying common words and phrases from these dictionaries as passwords. If users choose guessable passwords based on dictionary words, they are highly vulnerable to such attacks, as the attacker does not need to guess randomly but can systematically test known words."
"Explain the concept of password ageing, specifically focusing on the role of expiry dates.","Password ageing is a security policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords. The primary role of these expiry dates is to force users to change their passwords regularly. This practice helps mitigate the risk of a compromised password remaining valid indefinitely, reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker who might have obtained an old password."
How does password ageing prevent users from reverting to old passwords?,"Password ageing policies prevent users from reverting to old passwords by keeping a record, such as a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used. This mechanism ensures that when a user is prompted to change their password due to an expiry date, they cannot simply reuse a recently discarded password, thereby maintaining a higher level of security and preventing predictable password cycling."
Describe the security policy of limiting login attempts and its purpose.,"Limiting login attempts is a security policy where the system monitors unsuccessful login attempts. Its purpose is to prevent or discourage further attempts by an attacker. The system reacts by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval, after a certain number of failed attempts. This mechanism thwarts brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries numerous password combinations, by making such attempts impractical and time-consuming."
What information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to enhance security awareness?,"After a successful login, to enhance security awareness and warn the user about recently attempted attacks, the system should display the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since that last successful login. This information allows users to quickly identify any suspicious activity on their account and take appropriate action if unauthorized attempts are detected."
Explain what a passphrase is and how it functions as an alternative form of password.,"A **passphrase** is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the (fixed-size) actual passwords from these passphrases. This method leverages human memory for longer, more complex inputs while still relying on cryptographic hashing for secure storage, offering a balance between usability and security."
Describe visual drawing patterns as an alternative form of password.,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password primarily used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern or sequence on a grid of points or images. This method provides a non-textual way for users to authenticate."
What are picture passwords and where are they typically used?,"Picture passwords are an alternative form of password where users select objects in pictures and patterns for authentication. This method was notably used in Windows 8, offering a visual and interactive way for users to log in instead of typing a traditional alphanumeric password."
Briefly describe one-time passwords as an alternative authentication method.,"One-time passwords are an alternative form of password that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short period, providing enhanced security by preventing replay attacks if the password is intercepted."
What role does the operating system play concerning user password files?,"The operating system maintains a file that contains user names and their corresponding passwords (or more accurately, password hashes). This **password file** is a critical component of system security, as it stores the credentials necessary for user authentication."
What are the primary threats an attacker poses to the password file?,"An attacker primarily poses threats to the confidentiality or integrity of the password file. **Confidentiality** refers to preventing unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning an attacker might try to read the password file. **Integrity** refers to maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information, meaning an attacker might try to alter the password file, for example, to change a user's password or add a new user."
Explain cryptographic protection as an option for securing the password file.,"Cryptographic protection is an option for securing the password file by encrypting its contents. **Cryptographic protection** involves using encryption algorithms to transform the data in the password file into an unreadable format, making it unintelligible to unauthorized individuals. Only those with the correct decryption key can access the original information, thereby protecting the confidentiality of the stored usernames and passwords."
How does access control contribute to protecting the password file?,"Access control contributes to protecting the password file by enforcing restrictions on who can read, write, or execute the file. This **access control** is typically enforced by the operating system, which manages permissions for files and directories. By limiting access to only authorized system processes or administrators, it prevents unauthorized users or malicious software from directly accessing or tampering with the password file."
Describe a comprehensive approach to protecting the password file using a combination of methods.,"A comprehensive approach to protecting the password file involves a combination of cryptographic protection and access control. This means the file's contents are encrypted (**cryptographic protection**) and the operating system enforces strict permissions on who can access the file (**access control**). Additionally, this combined approach can include further measures to slow down **dictionary attacks**, which are attempts to crack passwords by systematically trying words from a dictionary. These additional measures could include rate limiting access attempts or increasing the computational cost of verifying passwords."
Differentiate between modern password hashing algorithms and general-purpose crypto hashes like SHA family or KECCAK.,"Modern password hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, are specifically designed for securely storing passwords and are characterized by being intentionally slow. This slowness is a security feature, configurable via a **work factor**, to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive. In contrast, general-purpose crypto hashes, like those in the SHA family and KECCAK, are designed to be fast for integrity checks and other cryptographic applications where speed is paramount. Their speed makes them unsuitable for direct password storage as it would allow attackers to quickly test many password guesses."
How does the uniqueness of salt for every user impact an attacker's effort to crack hashes?,"The uniqueness of a salt for every user significantly increases an attacker's effort to crack hashes. Instead of calculating a hash once for a common password and comparing it against every stored hash (which would be possible without unique salts), an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt for each user. This means the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making it significantly harder to crack large numbers of hashes simultaneously."
Summarize the three initial password policies outlined in the recap section.,"The initial three password policies outlined in the recap section are: 1. **Set a password**: This is fundamental because without a password, an attacker doesn't even need to guess to gain access. 2. **Change default passwords**: Default passwords, often common values like ""manager"", are easy for attackers to exploit if left unchanged after system installation. 3. **Avoid guessable passwords**: This involves prescribing a minimal password length and enforcing a complex password format that mixes upper and lower case characters (**case-sensitive**), numerical, and other non-alphabetical symbols (**alphanumeric**), especially considering the existence of online dictionaries for various languages."
Summarize the password policies related to password ageing and limiting login attempts.,"The password policies related to password ageing and limiting login attempts are: 1. **Password ageing**: This involves setting expiry dates for passwords to force users to change them regularly. It also includes preventing users from reverting to old passwords by keeping a list of previously used passwords, such as the last ""ten"". 2. **Limit login attempts**: This policy involves the system monitoring unsuccessful login attempts and reacting by locking the user account (either completely or for a given time interval) to prevent or discourage further brute-force attempts."
Explain the password policy concerning informing the user about login activity.,"The password policy concerning informing the user about login activity dictates that after a successful login, the system should display the time of the last login and the number of failed login attempts since. The purpose of this policy is to warn the user about recently attempted attacks, allowing them to detect and react to potential unauthorized access attempts to their account."
Compare the security advantages of using passphrases over traditional short passwords.,"Passphrases offer security advantages over traditional short passwords primarily due to their length and memorability. Users can enter sentences or long phrases that are easy for them to remember, which naturally leads to a much longer input string than a typical password. This increased length significantly expands the search space for an attacker, making brute-force attacks much more computationally intensive and time-consuming, even though the system still applies a hash function to compute a fixed-size actual password."
What is the significance of 'case-sensitive' in the context of password format?,"In the context of password format, 'case-sensitive' means that the distinction between upper and lower case characters matters. For example, 'Password' is considered different from 'password'. This significance lies in increasing the complexity and the number of possible character combinations for a given password length, thereby making it harder for attackers to guess or crack the password through brute-force methods."
Define 'alphanumeric' in the context of password requirements and explain its security benefit.,"In the context of password requirements, 'alphanumeric' refers to a password format that includes a mix of alphabetical characters (both upper and lower case) and numerical digits. The security benefit of requiring alphanumeric characters, often combined with other non-alphabetical symbols, is that it significantly increases the entropy and complexity of a password. This makes the password much harder to guess or crack through brute-force or dictionary attacks, as the attacker must consider a wider range of character types."
Why are fast cryptographic hashes like SHA family or KECCAK not suitable for directly storing passwords?,"Fast cryptographic hashes like the SHA family or KECCAK are not suitable for directly storing passwords because their speed, while beneficial for other cryptographic applications, makes them vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks when used for passwords. An attacker who obtains a database of password hashes generated by a fast algorithm can quickly test millions or billions of password guesses per second, making it feasible to crack many passwords in a relatively short amount of time. Modern password hashing algorithms are intentionally designed to be slow to counteract this."
Explain what compromising the 'integrity' of a password file means.,"Compromising the 'integrity' of a password file means that an attacker has managed to alter or tamper with the data within the file in an unauthorized way. For example, an attacker might change a user's password hash to one they know, add new unauthorized user accounts, or modify existing account permissions. This undermines the trustworthiness and reliability of the password data, potentially granting the attacker control over user accounts or the system itself."
Explain what compromising the 'confidentiality' of a password file means.,"Compromising the 'confidentiality' of a password file means that an attacker has gained unauthorized access to read the contents of the file. While the file typically stores password hashes rather than plain-text passwords, gaining access to these hashes still allows an attacker to perform offline brute-force or dictionary attacks to try and crack the original passwords. This breach of confidentiality is a critical step for attackers aiming to gain unauthorized access to user accounts."
What is the role of a hash function when a user enters a passphrase?,"When a user enters a passphrase, the system applies a **hash function** to compute the (fixed-size) actual passwords. A **hash function** is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (the passphrase) and converts it into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value or digest. This hash value is then stored instead of the original passphrase. This process ensures that the actual passphrase is never stored directly, enhancing security, while still allowing the system to verify the passphrase upon subsequent logins by hashing the entered passphrase and comparing the result to the stored hash."
What is the security rationale behind preventing users from reverting to old passwords?,"The security rationale behind preventing users from reverting to old passwords is to mitigate the risk associated with previously compromised or weak passwords. If an attacker has obtained an old password, allowing a user to revert to it would immediately re-enable the attacker's access. By keeping a history of used passwords (e.g., the last ""ten""), the system ensures that users are forced to create genuinely new passwords, reducing the likelihood of an attacker successfully reusing a known credential."
Analyze how password ageing contributes to overall password security.,"Password ageing contributes to overall password security by reducing the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a compromised password. By forcing users to change passwords regularly through expiry dates, it ensures that even if a password is stolen or guessed, its validity period is limited. Furthermore, by preventing users from reverting to old passwords, it ensures that new passwords are truly distinct, thereby continuously refreshing the security posture of user accounts against persistent or historical credential compromise."
"In what context are visual drawing patterns typically used as an alternative password form, citing an example?","Visual drawing patterns are typically used as an alternative password form on touch interfaces. A prominent example of this usage is in Android operating systems, where users can unlock their devices by drawing a specific pattern on a grid, rather than typing a traditional password or PIN."
"Which operating system notably used picture passwords, and how did they function?","Windows 8 notably used picture passwords as an alternative form of authentication. In this system, users would select specific objects or patterns within a chosen picture. This method allowed for a more visual and interactive login experience compared to traditional text-based passwords."
What is the direct consequence if a user account has no password set?,"If a user account has no password set, the direct consequence is that an attacker does not even have to guess it. This means anyone can gain unauthorized access to the account without any authentication barrier, making the account and potentially the entire system extremely vulnerable."
"Explain why default passwords, despite their utility for field engineers, are problematic from a security standpoint.","Default passwords, such as ""manager"", are problematic from a security standpoint because they are widely known or easily guessable. While they serve a utility for field engineers during system installation, if these default values are left unchanged, they provide an easy entry point for attackers. Attackers can exploit these common credentials to break into systems without needing to perform complex cracking techniques, posing a significant and avoidable security risk."
How does the policy of limiting login attempts specifically deter brute-force attacks?,"The policy of limiting login attempts specifically deters **brute-force attacks** by making them impractical. A **brute-force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or encryption key by trying many combinations. By monitoring unsuccessful login attempts and locking the user account after a few failures (either completely or for a time interval), the system drastically slows down or completely stops an attacker's ability to systematically try numerous password combinations, thereby rendering brute-force attempts ineffective and time-consuming."
What is the primary purpose of displaying the time of last login and failed login attempts to a user after successful authentication?,"The primary purpose of displaying the time of last login and the number of failed login attempts to a user after successful authentication is to warn the user about recently attempted attacks. This information serves as an immediate alert, allowing the user to detect any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts on their account. If the user notices an unfamiliar login time or an unexpected number of failed attempts, they can take prompt action, such as changing their password or reporting the activity, to secure their account."
Explain how salting prevents an attacker from determining if two users share the same password.,"Salting prevents an attacker from determining whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes because different salts will result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical. Since each user's password is combined with a unique, randomly generated salt before hashing, the resulting hash values will be distinct. This means an attacker cannot simply compare two stored hash values to infer if the original passwords were the same, thus preserving user privacy and security."
List and briefly describe the three main options for protecting the password file.,"The three main options for protecting the password file are: 1. **Cryptographic protection**: This involves encrypting the contents of the password file, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals without the correct decryption key. 2. **Access control enforced by the operating system**: This means setting permissions on the password file to restrict who can access it, ensuring only authorized system processes or administrators can read or modify it. 3. **Combination of cryptographic protection and access control**: This approach integrates both encryption and strict access permissions, often supplemented with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks, providing a robust multi-layered defense for the password file."
What is the significance of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition winner?,"The significance of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition winner is that Argon2 was selected as the leading modern hashing algorithm specifically designed for securely storing passwords. This competition aimed to identify the best algorithm for this purpose, emphasizing features like resistance to various attacks and configurability, thereby providing a strong recommendation for secure password storage practices."
How does the 'time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes' principle apply to salting?,"The principle that 'time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes' applies to salting because each password hash is generated with a unique salt. This forces an attacker to process each hash individually, applying the correct unique salt for each attempt. Consequently, cracking a large number of hashes becomes a linear process in terms of computational effort, directly proportional to the total number of hashes, rather than a single computation that could be applied across many hashes simultaneously."
