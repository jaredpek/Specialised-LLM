"Define the concept of ""salting"" in password storage.","Salting is the process where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password as part of the hashing process."
Explain how salting enhances password security against cracking attempts.,"Salting enhances password security by making cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder. Because a unique salt is used for every user, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This increases the time required for cracking in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Describe the impact of salting on an attacker's ability to pre-compute hashes.,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Since each password has a unique salt, pre-computed hashes for common passwords become ineffective, as the attacker would need to pre-compute hashes for every possible password combined with every possible salt."
How does salting prevent an attacker from determining if two users share the same password?,Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because different salts will result in different hashes even if the underlying passwords are identical.
List modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt passwords, so no additional steps are required when using them."
What is the primary characteristic of modern hashing algorithms designed for secure password storage?,"Modern hashing algorithms designed for securely storing passwords are characterized by being slow. This deliberate slowness is unlike crypto hashes such as the SHA family and KECCAK, which are designed to be fast."
How can the slowness of modern password hashing algorithms be configured?,"The slowness of modern password hashing algorithms can be configured by changing the ""work factor."" A higher work factor increases the computational effort required, making the hashing process slower and more resistant to brute-force attacks."
Which algorithm was recognized as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition?,Argon2 was the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
What is the recommended alternative for password storage if Argon2 is not available?,The bcrypt password hashing function should be the second choice for password storage if Argon2 is not available.
"Identify potential difficulties users face when forced to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords.","Users may face several difficulties when forced to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords. These include difficulty memorizing complex passwords, difficulty dealing with frequent password changes, and finding ways of re-using their favorite password."
What is a common consequence if users struggle with complex password policies?,"A common consequence if users struggle with complex password policies, such as those requiring long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords, is that they may write their passwords down on a piece of paper kept close to the computer."
Explain the importance of setting a password for a user account.,"Setting a password for a user account is crucial because if there is no password, an attacker does not even have to guess it, gaining unauthorized access directly."
Why is it important to change default passwords on system accounts?,"It is important to change default passwords on system accounts because they often have common default values, such as ""manager."" If left unchanged, these default passwords make it easy for an attacker to break into the system."
What are the key characteristics of a strong password format to avoid guessable passwords?,"A strong password format to avoid guessable passwords should prescribe a minimal password length and mix upper and lower case characters (making it case-sensitive). It should also include numerical and other non-alphabetical symbols, making it alphanumeric."
How do online dictionaries impact the security of guessable passwords?,"Today, online dictionaries for almost every language exist, which significantly impacts the security of guessable passwords. Attackers can use these dictionaries in dictionary attacks to quickly try common words and phrases, making simple or dictionary-based passwords highly vulnerable."
"Define ""password ageing"" as a password policy.","Password ageing is a password policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords to force users to change their passwords regularly. It also includes measures to prevent users from reverting to old passwords, such as keeping a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used."
What is the purpose of limiting login attempts in a password policy?,"The purpose of limiting login attempts is to prevent or discourage further unauthorized access attempts. The system monitors unsuccessful login attempts and can react by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval, after a certain number of failed attempts."
Why should a user be informed about their last login time and failed login attempts?,A user should be informed about their last login time and the number of failed login attempts since their last successful login to warn them about recently attempted attacks. This allows users to detect and report suspicious activity.
"Describe a ""passphrase"" as an alternative form of password.",A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size passwords from these phrases.
"What are ""visual drawing patterns"" in the context of alternative passwords?","Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password typically used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users create a pattern by connecting points on a grid or drawing a specific shape."
"Explain ""picture passwords"" as an alternative authentication method.","Picture passwords are an alternative authentication method where users select objects in pictures and patterns. This method was used, for example, in Windows 8, requiring users to interact with an image to authenticate."
"What are ""one-time passwords""?",One-time passwords are an alternative form of password that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after use or a short period.
"What is the ""password file"" maintained by an operating system?","The ""password file"" is a file maintained by the operating system that contains user names and their corresponding passwords or password hashes."
What are the potential risks if an attacker compromises the password file?,"If an attacker compromises the password file, the potential risks include compromising the confidentiality or integrity of the file. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts or manipulation of password data."
List the primary options for protecting the password file.,"The primary options for protecting the password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, and a combination of cryptographic protection and access control."
Describe the combined approach for protecting the password file.,"The combined approach for protecting the password file involves using both cryptographic protection and access control. This method can also include further measures to slow down dictionary attacks, enhancing overall security."
"What is a ""salt"" in the context of password hashing?","A salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process."
How does the uniqueness of a salt for every user affect an attacker's strategy?,"The uniqueness of a salt for every user forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt. This prevents them from calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash, significantly increasing the effort required for a successful attack."
"What does ""pre-computing hashes"" refer to in the context of password attacks?",Pre-computing hashes refers to an attacker calculating and storing hashes for common passwords (often in structures like rainbow tables or database-based lookups) before attempting to crack actual password hashes. This allows for rapid comparison and identification of passwords.
"Why are modern hashing algorithms for passwords designed to be ""slow""?","Modern hashing algorithms for passwords are designed to be ""slow"" to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming. This deliberate slowness increases the time and resources an attacker needs to try many password combinations, thereby enhancing security."
"What is a ""work factor"" in password hashing?","A ""work factor"" is a configurable parameter in modern password hashing algorithms that determines how slow the hashing process will be. By changing the work factor, the computational intensity of the hashing operation can be adjusted."
What is the main advantage of Argon2 over older hashing algorithms for password storage?,"The main advantage of Argon2, as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, is its design specifically for securely storing passwords, incorporating features like resistance to GPU cracking and side-channel attacks, and its configurable slowness via a work factor."
What is the primary benefit of bcrypt for password storage?,"The primary benefit of bcrypt for password storage is its design to be slow and adaptive, meaning its computational cost can be increased over time to keep pace with increasing hardware capabilities, making brute-force attacks more difficult."
"What are ""rainbow tables"" and how does salting mitigate their threat?","Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables of hashes used to reverse cryptographic hash functions, often for cracking passwords. Salting mitigates their threat because the unique salt added to each password means that even if the same password is used by multiple users, their hashes will be different, rendering generic rainbow tables ineffective."
"What is the consequence of users re-using their favorite password, even with complex password policies?","The consequence of users re-using their favorite password, even when forced to use complex password policies, is that if that favorite password is ever compromised for one account, all other accounts using the same password become vulnerable."
What is the risk associated with default passwords for system accounts?,"The risk associated with default passwords for system accounts is that they are often publicly known or easily guessable (e.g., ""manager""). If these are not changed, an attacker can easily gain unauthorized access to the system."
"What does ""case-sensitive"" mean in the context of password format?","In the context of password format, ""case-sensitive"" means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct characters. For example, ""Password"" would be considered different from ""password."""
"What are ""alphanumeric"" symbols in password creation?","""Alphanumeric"" symbols in password creation refer to a combination of alphabetical characters (A-Z, a-z) and numerical digits (0-9), along with other non-alphabetical symbols like punctuation or special characters."
How does preventing users from reverting to old passwords improve security?,"Preventing users from reverting to old passwords improves security by ensuring that even if an old password was compromised, it cannot be reused, thus limiting the window of vulnerability for that specific password. This is often achieved by keeping a history of previously used passwords, such as a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used."
How can an operating system enforce access control on the password file?,"An operating system can enforce access control on the password file by setting permissions that restrict which users or processes can read, write, or execute the file. Typically, only privileged system processes should have direct access to the raw password file."
What is the primary goal of cryptographic protection for the password file?,"The primary goal of cryptographic protection for the password file is to encrypt the stored passwords or their hashes, making them unreadable to unauthorized individuals even if they gain access to the file. This protects the confidentiality of the password data."
What is the benefit of displaying the time of last login to a user?,"The benefit of displaying the time of last login to a user is to provide them with an immediate indication of whether their account has been accessed by someone else. If the displayed time does not match their last activity, it serves as a warning of potential unauthorized access."
How do visual drawing patterns enhance security compared to simple PINs?,Visual drawing patterns enhance security compared to simple PINs by offering a larger keyspace and making it harder for shoulder-surfers to observe and replicate the input. The complexity of the pattern can be much greater than a short numerical sequence.
In what operating system were picture passwords notably used?,Picture passwords were notably used in Windows 8.
What is the main characteristic that differentiates one-time passwords from traditional static passwords?,"The main characteristic that differentiates one-time passwords from traditional static passwords is their ephemeral nature: they are valid for only a single use or a very short duration, significantly reducing the risk of replay attacks or compromise through theft."
"Why is it important for password hashing algorithms to be ""slow"" rather than ""fast"" like crypto hashes?","It is important for password hashing algorithms to be ""slow"" rather than ""fast"" because their purpose is to protect against brute-force attacks. A slow hash makes it computationally expensive for an attacker to try many password guesses, whereas fast crypto hashes are designed for speed in general data integrity checks."
"How does the ""work factor"" contribute to the future-proofing of password hashing?","The ""work factor"" contributes to the future-proofing of password hashing by allowing the computational cost of hashing to be increased over time. As computing power grows, the work factor can be adjusted upwards to maintain the same level of resistance against brute-force attacks, without requiring a complete change of the hashing algorithm."
"What is the primary purpose of ""password policies""?","The primary purpose of ""password policies"" is to establish rules and guidelines for creating, managing, and protecting passwords within a system or organization, aiming to enhance overall security by making passwords harder to guess, crack, or compromise."
What is the risk of not having a minimal password length policy?,"The risk of not having a minimal password length policy is that users might choose very short passwords, which are significantly easier and faster for attackers to guess or brute-force, thereby compromising account security."
How does the system react to unsuccessful login attempts when a limit is imposed?,"When a limit is imposed on unsuccessful login attempts, the system reacts by monitoring these attempts and, upon reaching the predefined limit, it locks the user account. This lock can be either complete or for a given time interval, serving to prevent or discourage further unauthorized access attempts."
