What is salting in the context of password storage?,"Salting is a security measure in password storage where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This process makes it significantly harder for attackers to crack large numbers of hashes."
How does salting enhance password security?,"Salting enhances password security by making it significantly harder for an attacker to crack hashes. Since a unique salt is used for every user, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This increases the time required for cracking in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
"What is a ""salt"" in password hashing?","A ""salt"" in password hashing is a unique, randomly generated string that is appended to each password before it undergoes the hashing process. Its purpose is to ensure that even identical passwords result in different hashes, thereby increasing security."
How does salting protect against pre-computing hashes?,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes by making it impossible to use techniques like rainbow tables or database-based lookups. Because each password has a unique salt, the pre-computed hashes would not match the salted hashes stored in the system, rendering such attacks ineffective."
Explain how salting prevents an attacker from determining if two users share the same password.,"Salting prevents an attacker from determining if two users share the same password because the different salts applied to each user's password will result in different hashes, even if the original passwords are identical. This means an attacker cannot simply compare hash values to identify users with the same password."
Which modern hashing algorithms automatically incorporate salting?,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This means that no additional steps are required from the user or system administrator to implement salting when using these algorithms."
What is the primary characteristic of modern hashing algorithms designed for secure password storage?,"The primary characteristic of modern hashing algorithms designed for secure password storage is that they should be slow. Unlike cryptographic hashes such as the SHA family and KECCAK, which are designed for speed, password hashing algorithms are intentionally slow to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming."
How can the slowness of password hashing algorithms be adjusted?,"The slowness of password hashing algorithms can be adjusted by changing the ""work factor."" The work factor is a configurable parameter that controls the computational effort required to compute a hash, allowing administrators to balance security with performance requirements."
What is the significance of Argon2 in password hashing?,"Argon2 is significant in password hashing because it was the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. This recognition highlights its strength and suitability for securely storing passwords, making it a highly recommended choice."
What is the recommended alternative for password storage if Argon2 is not available?,"If Argon2 is not available for password storage, the bcrypt password hashing function should be considered the second choice. Bcrypt is another robust algorithm specifically designed for secure password hashing."
"What are the potential drawbacks of forcing users to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords?","Forcing users to use long, complex, system-generated, and frequently changed passwords can lead to several drawbacks: users may have difficulty memorizing complex passwords, they may struggle with frequent password changes, and they might find ways to re-use their favorite passwords, or even write them down, which compromises security."
Why might users write down their passwords?,"Users might write down their passwords, keeping them close to the computer, if they are forced to use complex passwords that are difficult to memorize, or if they are required to change them frequently, making it hard to keep track of new ones."
What is the first recommendation in password policies?,"The first recommendation in password policies is to ""Set a password."" This is crucial because if there is no password for a user account, an attacker does not even need to guess it, gaining immediate access."
Why is it important to change default passwords?,"It is important to change default passwords because they often have common values, such as ""manager,"" which are widely known. While default passwords assist field engineers during system installation, if left unchanged, they make it easy for an attacker to break into the system."
What are the guidelines for avoiding guessable passwords?,"To avoid guessable passwords, policies should prescribe a minimal password length and enforce a specific password format. The recommended format includes a mix of upper and lower case characters (case-sensitive), numerical symbols, and other non-alphabetical symbols (alphanumeric). This is important because online dictionaries for almost every language exist, making simple or common passwords easily guessable."
"Define ""case-sensitive"" in the context of password format.","In the context of password format, ""case-sensitive"" means that the system distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, ""Password"" would be considered different from ""password."""
"What does ""alphanumeric"" mean for password symbols?","For password symbols, ""alphanumeric"" refers to characters that include both alphabetical letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerical digits (0-9), as well as other non-alphabetical symbols (e.g., !, @, #, $)."
What is password ageing?,"Password ageing is a password policy that involves setting expiry dates for passwords to compel users to change their passwords regularly. It also includes measures to prevent users from reverting to old passwords, such as maintaining a list of the last ""ten"" passwords used."
What is the purpose of limiting login attempts?,"The purpose of limiting login attempts is to prevent or discourage further unauthorized access attempts by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts. If a certain number of failed attempts occur, the system can react by locking the user account, either completely or for a given time interval."
How can informing the user after a successful login contribute to security?,"Informing the user after a successful login can contribute to security by displaying the time of their last login and the number of failed login attempts since. This warns the user about any recently attempted attacks, allowing them to take action if suspicious activity is detected."
What is a passphrase as an alternative form of password?,A passphrase is an alternative form of password where a user enters sentences or long phrases that are easy to remember. The system then applies a hash function to compute the actual fixed-size password from this passphrase.
Describe visual drawing patterns as an alternative password.,"Visual drawing patterns are an alternative form of password typically used on touch interfaces, such as those found in Android devices. Users authenticate by drawing a specific pattern on a grid or set of points."
What are picture passwords and where are they used?,Picture passwords are an alternative form of password where users select specific objects or patterns within a given picture to authenticate. This method was notably used in Windows 8.
What are one-time passwords?,"One-time passwords (OTPs) are an alternative form of password that is valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are typically generated dynamically and expire after a short period or a single use, providing enhanced security against replay attacks."
"What is the ""password file"" maintained by an operating system?","The ""password file"" maintained by an operating system is a file that stores user names and their corresponding passwords, typically in a hashed or encrypted format. This file is critical for user authentication."
What is the main risk associated with the password file?,"The main risk associated with the password file is that an attacker could try to compromise its confidentiality or integrity. Compromising confidentiality means gaining unauthorized access to the password data, while compromising integrity means altering the data."
What are the general options for protecting the password file?,"The general options for protecting the password file include cryptographic protection, access control enforced by the operating system, or a combination of both cryptographic protection and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks."
How does cryptographic protection secure the password file?,"Cryptographic protection secures the password file by encrypting its contents, making the stored passwords unreadable to unauthorized individuals even if they gain access to the file. This ensures the confidentiality of the password data."
How does access control enforced by the operating system protect the password file?,"Access control enforced by the operating system protects the password file by restricting who can read, write, or execute the file. This ensures that only authorized processes or users, typically the operating system itself or specific administrative accounts, can interact with the password file."
"What combined approach can be used to protect the password file, and what additional measures might be included?","A combined approach to protect the password file involves using both cryptographic protection and access control. Additionally, further measures can be included to slow down dictionary attacks, such as using strong hashing algorithms with high work factors and salting."
"What is the definition of a ""work factor"" in password hashing?","A ""work factor"" in password hashing is a configurable parameter that determines the computational difficulty and time required to compute a hash. By increasing the work factor, the hashing process becomes slower, making brute-force attacks more time-consuming and expensive for attackers."
Why are modern password hashing algorithms designed to be slow?,"Modern password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow to make it significantly harder and more time-consuming for attackers to perform brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks. This intentional slowness increases the cost and effort required for an attacker to crack passwords, even with powerful computing resources."
What is Argon2id?,"Argon2id is a modern hashing algorithm specifically designed for securely storing passwords. It is one of the variants of Argon2, which won the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, and it automatically salts passwords, requiring no additional steps for implementation."
What is bcrypt?,Bcrypt is a password hashing function that is considered a strong choice for password storage. It is a modern hashing algorithm that automatically salts passwords and is recommended as the second choice if Argon2 is not available.
What is PBKDF2?,"PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a modern hashing algorithm used for securely storing passwords. It automatically salts passwords, meaning no additional steps are needed for salting when it is implemented."
How do modern hashing algorithms differ from crypto hashes like SHA family and KECCAK?,"Modern hashing algorithms designed for secure password storage differ from crypto hashes like the SHA family and KECCAK primarily in their design goal: modern password hashes are intentionally designed to be slow to deter brute-force attacks, whereas crypto hashes are designed to be fast for general cryptographic purposes."
What is the consequence of not setting a password for a user account?,"The consequence of not setting a password for a user account is that an attacker does not even have to guess it, meaning they can gain immediate and unauthorized access to the account without any effort."
What is the risk associated with default passwords if they are not changed?,"The risk associated with default passwords if they are not changed is that they are often common and publicly known (e.g., ""manager""). This makes it easy for an attacker to break into the system, as they can simply try these well-known default values."
Why is a minimal password length important for security?,A minimal password length is important for security because shorter passwords are generally easier and faster for attackers to crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks. Enforcing a minimum length increases the complexity and time required for such attacks.
What information should be displayed to a user after a successful login to warn them about potential attacks?,"After a successful login, the system should display the time of the user's last login and the number of failed login attempts since that last login. This information serves to warn the user about any recently attempted attacks on their account."
How do one-time passwords enhance security?,"One-time passwords (OTPs) enhance security by being valid for only a single login session or transaction. This means that even if an attacker intercepts an OTP, it cannot be reused for subsequent access, effectively preventing replay attacks and unauthorized access."
What is the role of a hash function in computing actual passwords from passphrases?,"The role of a hash function in computing actual passwords from passphrases is to transform the user-entered sentence or long phrase into a fixed-size, actual password. This process ensures that the system stores a secure, one-way representation of the passphrase rather than the passphrase itself."
How do visual drawing patterns function as a password?,"Visual drawing patterns function as a password by requiring the user to reproduce a specific sequence of movements or connections on a touch interface. This pattern is then used by the system to authenticate the user, similar to how a traditional password would be verified."
In what operating system were picture passwords notably used?,"Picture passwords were notably used in Windows 8. In this system, users would authenticate by selecting specific objects or patterns within a chosen image."
What kind of attacks do measures to slow down dictionary attacks aim to prevent?,"Measures to slow down dictionary attacks aim to prevent attackers from quickly guessing passwords by trying a large list of common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords. These measures increase the computational cost and time required for each guess, making such attacks impractical."
What is the primary goal of salting in password storage?,"The primary goal of salting in password storage is to make cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder. By adding a unique, randomly generated string to each password before hashing, it forces attackers to crack hashes one at a time, rather than using pre-computed tables or comparing against a single stored hash."
Why is it difficult to deal with frequent password changes for users?,"It is difficult for users to deal with frequent password changes because it requires them to constantly remember new, complex passwords. This can lead to frustration, the re-use of old passwords, or even writing down passwords, all of which can compromise security."
What is the benefit of preventing users from reverting to old passwords in a password ageing policy?,"The benefit of preventing users from reverting to old passwords in a password ageing policy is that it enhances security by ensuring that users create genuinely new passwords. If users could simply cycle through a few old passwords, the security benefit of regular changes would be negated, as an attacker might already know those old passwords."
How does locking a user account after too many failed login attempts protect the system?,"Locking a user account after too many failed login attempts protects the system by preventing brute-force attacks. It stops an attacker from continuously trying different password combinations, thereby limiting their ability to guess the correct password and gain unauthorized access."
What is the role of the operating system in maintaining the password file?,The operating system plays a crucial role in maintaining the password file by storing user names and their corresponding passwords. It is responsible for managing access to this file and enforcing security measures to protect its confidentiality and integrity.
