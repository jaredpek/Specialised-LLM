List the key disadvantages associated with biometric authentication techniques.,"The key disadvantages associated with biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define what a 'false negative' means in the context of biometric authentication.,"A false negative occurs when a user is indeed an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device incorrectly rejects that user."
Explain the concept of a 'false positive' in biometric authentication systems.,"A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a legitimate user, meaning the biometric authentication device incorrectly accepts the impersonator as an authentic user."
Describe the social acceptance issue related to biometric authentication techniques.,Social acceptance is an issue to take into account when considering biometric authentication techniques. All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than simply entering a password.
What is the primary concern regarding key management in biometric authentication?,"The primary concern regarding key management in biometric authentication techniques is that measurements of the user's biology are used to construct a key, a supposedly unique sequence of zeros and ones corresponding to a particular user. If an attacker obtains these biological measurements, they can impersonate the user."
Provide an example of how a criminal might exploit the key management issue in biometric authentication.,"For example, a criminal may be able to ""copy"" a user's fingerprint by re-creating it with a wax imprint that the criminal then puts on top of their own finger, allowing them to impersonate the user."
How does the key management issue in biometric systems differ from that in password systems when a 'key' is compromised?,"In biometric systems, if a user's fingerprint (considered a ""key"") is stolen, it cannot be revoked because the user cannot get a new fingerprint. By contrast, in password systems, keys are generated from passwords, and users can easily change their passwords if they are ever stolen or compromised."
Under what circumstances does biometric authentication become ineffective?,Biometric authentication becomes ineffective once attackers are able to impersonate biometric measurements.
What are biometrics utilized for in individual authentication techniques?,"Biometrics are utilized in individual authentication techniques to identify individuals by checking physiological or behavioral characteristics. These characteristics include fingerprints, faces, voice, iris patterns, and signatures."
Why are biometric systems considered convenient?,"Biometric systems are considered convenient because they eliminate the need for users to memorize something, such as passwords, or to carry something about, such as ID tokens."
What dangerous situation can arise if a user's biometric data is abused?,"A user of biometric systems would get into a dangerous situation when their biometric data is abused, as this could lead to unauthorized access or impersonation."
Explain the fundamental difference in mutability between biometric data and passwords/ID tokens when compromised.,"The fundamental difference is that you cannot change your fingerprints or other biometric data if they are compromised, whereas you can change your passwords or ID tokens when they are compromised."
"According to Matsumoto, what two aspects should a security assessment of biometric user identification systems cover?","According to Matsumoto, a security assessment of biometric user identification systems should be conducted not only for the accuracy of authentication but also for security against fraud."
What two critical protections must biometric systems provide regarding biometric information?,"Biometric systems must protect the information for biometrics against abuse, and they must also prevent fake biometrics."
What is the overall topic of the document regarding biometrics?,The overall topic of the document regarding biometrics is the disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques.
What is the significance of 'varying social acceptance' as a disadvantage of biometric authentication?,"Varying social acceptance is a significant disadvantage because it indicates that biometric authentication techniques are generally less accepted by society compared to traditional methods like entering a password, which can hinder their widespread adoption and user comfort."
Why is the inability to revoke a stolen biometric 'key' a major problem?,"The inability to revoke a stolen biometric ""key"" is a major problem because, unlike passwords that can be changed, a user cannot get a new fingerprint or other biological measurement. This means that once compromised, the biometric data remains a permanent vulnerability for impersonation."
What kind of characteristics do biometric authentication techniques check to identify individuals?,"Biometric authentication techniques check physiological or behavioral characteristics to identify individuals. Examples include fingerprints, faces, voice, iris patterns, and signatures."
What is the implication of a 'tradeoff needed for both' false positives and false negatives in biometric systems?,"The implication of a 'tradeoff needed for both' false positives and false negatives is that improving one often comes at the expense of the other. For instance, making a system more sensitive to reduce false negatives might increase false positives, and vice-versa, requiring a balance based on the application's security and usability requirements."
How do biometric authentication techniques construct a 'key' for a user?,"Biometric authentication techniques construct a ""key"" for a user by taking measurements of the user's biology. These measurements are then used to create a supposedly unique sequence of zeros and ones that corresponds only to that particular user."
What is the consequence if an attacker successfully obtains a user's biological measurements?,"If an attacker is able to obtain a user's biological measurements, the consequence is that the attacker will be able to impersonate the user, thereby gaining unauthorized access to systems or data."
What is the title of the paper by Tsutomu Matsumoto mentioned in the document?,"The title of the paper by Tsutomu Matsumoto mentioned in the document is ""Gummy and Conductive Silicone Rubber Fingers - Importance of Vulnerability Analysis"" and also referenced as ""Matsumoto Fingerprint Paper-Asiacrypt2002""."
What is the author's affiliation for the paper on 'Gummy and Conductive Silicone Rubber Fingers'?,"The author, Tsutomu Matsumoto, is affiliated with Yokohama National University, Graduate School of Environment and Information Sciences."
"What is the core message regarding security assessment of biometric systems, as highlighted by Matsumoto?","The core message highlighted by Matsumoto is that security assessment of biometric user identification systems should not only focus on the accuracy of authentication but also, and critically, on security against fraud."
"Why is it problematic that biometric data cannot be changed once compromised, unlike passwords?","It is problematic because if biometric data, such as a fingerprint, is compromised, the user cannot simply change it like a password. This means the compromised biometric data could be used indefinitely by an attacker, making the authentication technique ineffective for that user permanently."
What are the two main categories of characteristics used in biometrics for identification?,The two main categories of characteristics used in biometrics for identification are physiological characteristics and behavioral characteristics.
Give three examples of physiological characteristics used in biometrics.,"Three examples of physiological characteristics used in biometrics are fingerprints, faces, and iris patterns."
