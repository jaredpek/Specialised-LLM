What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"The key disadvantages to biometric authentication techniques are the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues. A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully bypasses the system, while a false negative occurs when an authentic user is incorrectly rejected. Social acceptance refers to the willingness of users to adopt and use these techniques, and key management issues relate to the inability to revoke or change compromised biometric data."
"Define a ""false negative"" in the context of biometric authentication.","A false negative in the context of biometric authentication occurs when a user is indeed an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device incorrectly rejects that user, preventing their access."
"What is a ""false positive"" in biometric authentication?","A false positive in biometric authentication occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to the system."
Why is social acceptance considered a disadvantage for biometric authentication techniques?,Social acceptance is considered a disadvantage for biometric authentication techniques because it is an issue that needs to be taken into account. All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are generally less socially accepted than the simpler and more familiar act of entering a password.
Explain the key management issue as a disadvantage for biometric authentication.,"The key management issue is a significant disadvantage for biometric authentication techniques. In these systems, measurements of a user's biology are used to construct a key, which is a supposedly unique sequence of zeros and ones corresponding only to that particular user. The problem arises because if an attacker is able to obtain a user's biological measurements, they will be able to impersonate the user. Unlike passwords, which can be changed if compromised, a user cannot get a new fingerprint if their original one has been stolen, meaning the biometric ""key"" cannot be revoked."
"How can an attacker impersonate a user in a biometric system, specifically regarding fingerprints?","An attacker can impersonate a user in a biometric system by obtaining the user's biological measurements. For example, a criminal may be able to ""copy"" a user's fingerprint by re-creating it with a wax imprint that the criminal then puts on top of their own finger to bypass the system."
"What is the fundamental difference between key management in biometric systems and password systems when a ""key"" is compromised?","The fundamental difference in key management is that in biometric systems, if a user's ""key"" (e.g., a fingerprint) is stolen, it cannot be revoked because the user cannot get a new fingerprint. By contrast, in password systems, keys are generated from passwords, and users can easily have their passwords changed if they are ever stolen or compromised, effectively revoking the old key."
When does biometric authentication become ineffective?,"Biometric authentication becomes ineffective once attackers are able to successfully impersonate biometric measurements. This means that if an attacker can replicate or bypass the biometric check, the system's security is compromised."
What are biometrics used for in individual authentication techniques?,"Biometrics are utilized in individual authentication techniques to identify individuals by checking their physiological or behavioral characteristics. Physiological characteristics include fingerprints, faces, and iris patterns, while behavioral characteristics include voice and signatures."
Why are biometric systems considered convenient?,"Biometric systems are considered convenient because they eliminate the need for users to memorize something, such as passwords, or to carry something about, such as ID tokens. This simplifies the authentication process for the user."
What is the risk associated with the abuse of biometric data?,"The risk associated with the abuse of biometric data is that a user of biometric systems would get into a dangerous situation when their biometric data is abused. This is because, unlike passwords or ID tokens, a user cannot change their fingerprints or other biometric data if they are compromised."
Who is Tsutomu Matsumoto and what is his affiliation mentioned in the document?,"Tsutomu Matsumoto is affiliated with Yokohama National University, specifically the Graduate School of Environment and Information Sciences, located at 79-7 Tokiwadai, Hodogaya, Yokohama 240-8501, Japan."

What kind of characteristics do biometric systems check for identification?,"Biometric systems check both physiological and behavioral characteristics for identification. Physiological characteristics are physical traits like fingerprints, faces, and iris patterns, while behavioral characteristics are unique patterns of behavior like voice and signatures."
Can a user change their biometric data like fingerprints if they are compromised?,"No, a user cannot change their biometric data like fingerprints if they are compromised. This is a significant disadvantage compared to passwords or ID tokens, which can be changed when stolen or compromised."
"What is the ""tradeoff needed for both"" in the context of false positives and false negatives?","The ""tradeoff needed for both"" refers to the balance that must be achieved between minimizing false positives and false negatives in biometric authentication systems. Improving the performance in one area often comes at the expense of the other, requiring careful calibration to optimize overall system effectiveness and security."
Why is it problematic that a user cannot get a new fingerprint if their original one has been stolen?,"It is problematic that a user cannot get a new fingerprint if their original one has been stolen because the fingerprint serves as a unique and unchangeable ""key"" for authentication. If this key is compromised, it cannot be revoked or replaced, leaving the user permanently vulnerable to impersonation using that stolen biometric data."
