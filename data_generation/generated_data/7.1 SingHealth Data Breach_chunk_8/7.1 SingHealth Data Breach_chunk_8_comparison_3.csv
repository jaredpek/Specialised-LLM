Compare database activity monitoring (DAM) with the lack of monitoring at the SCM database.,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are available on the market and can address some or all of the identified gaps in monitoring. In contrast, the SCM database experienced a lack of monitoring, and specifically, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What are the differences between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database in terms of security and criticality?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, with privileged access management not being the exclusive means of access, and logins possible without two-factor authentication. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this alternative route for convenience. Furthermore, there was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers. In contrast, the SCM database was treated as mission critical, implying a higher level of security and monitoring compared to the SGH Citrix servers, which were treated as not mission critical."
Explain the security vulnerabilities associated with the SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing these servers, and it was possible to log in by other means without two-factor authentication. This alternative route was known to and used by IHiS Citrix administrators for convenience. Additionally, there was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to the SGH Citrix servers."
Define RDP and explain its role in the security breach.,"RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. It is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection. In the context of the security breach, there was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers, which contributed to the overall vulnerability."
What were the monitoring practices for SGH Citrix servers compared to mission-critical systems?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. In contrast, vulnerability scanning, which is an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify security gaps, was carried out for mission-critical systems but was not performed for the SGH Citrix servers."
How did internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increase the attack surface?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while serving operational needs, created an avenue for the attacker to enter and exit the network. This allowed the attacker to use an internet-connected workstation to gain entry to the network, subsequently leading to the SCM database to steal medical data. The security risks associated with this internet connectivity were raised as early as August 2015."
What measures were determined by the healthcare sector regarding internet access by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for work. For staff who did require internet access for work, access would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time, was intended to be a 'remote browser'."
Explain the vulnerability related to Outlook versions used by IHiS.,"The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. The attacker was able to install this hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the installed Outlook application. A patch that would have prevented this vulnerability and the installation of the tool was available since late-2017, highlighting a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
What is C2 infrastructure and what were its uses in the context of the breach?,"C2 infrastructure refers to Command and Control servers. In the context of the breach, CSA's forensic analysis revealed Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These C2 servers were generally used for three purposes: Infection, where the server is used to drop malware into a system; Data exfiltration, where technical data is sent to the servers; and Beacon, where infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat', which is a slow, rhythmic communication to sustain communications."
What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are a number of network artifacts that appear to be overseas C2 servers. These are pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system memory or network traffic, that can provide evidence of a computer intrusion."
Describe the function of a 'beacon' in C2 infrastructure.,"A 'beacon' in C2 infrastructure refers to the connection of infected machines to C2 servers to establish a slow, rhythmic communication. This communication is meant to sustain the connection between the infected machine and the command and control server."
What was the critical factor that allowed the attacker access to the SCM database?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database. This compromise was facilitated by the fact that privileged access management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers, and logins were possible by other means without two-factor authentication."
What does 'Privileged Access Management' refer to in the context of server access?,"Privileged Access Management refers to the security controls and practices used to manage and monitor accounts that have elevated permissions on IT systems. In this context, it was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers, meaning other less secure methods were also available."
Explain the implication of logins to SGH Citrix servers being possible without 2-factor authentication.,"Logins to the SGH Citrix servers being possible without 2-factor authentication meant that an attacker could potentially gain access to these servers using only a username and password, bypassing an additional layer of security that verifies the user's identity. This significantly weakened the overall security posture of the servers."
What was the role of IHiS Citrix administrators in the security breach?,IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of the alternative route for logging into the SGH Citrix servers without two-factor authentication and made use of it for convenience. This awareness and utilization of a less secure method contributed to the overall vulnerability that the attacker exploited.
What is the significance of 'unauthorized access' to SGH Citrix servers?,"Unauthorized access to SGH Citrix servers means that individuals who were not permitted to access these servers were able to do so. This is a critical security failure, especially when these servers provide a pathway to sensitive data, such as the SCM database."
How did the lack of firewalls affect the security of SGH Citrix servers?,"The lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to the SGH Citrix servers created a direct pathway for attackers to potentially gain access to these systems from outside the network, bypassing security measures that would typically restrict such connections."
Compare the criticality of SGH Citrix servers with the SCM database.,"The SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission critical, whereas the SCM database was considered mission critical. This difference in perceived criticality likely influenced the level of security and monitoring applied to each system, with the SCM database presumably receiving more stringent controls."
What does it mean for servers to be 'not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts'?,"Servers that are 'not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts' are not continuously observed for immediate threats or anomalies. This means that any suspicious activities, vulnerabilities, or issues arising from these servers would not be detected and flagged promptly, allowing potential security breaches to go unnoticed for extended periods."
What is 'vulnerability scanning' and why was it not performed on SGH Citrix servers?,"Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify gaps in security. While this process was carried out for mission-critical systems, it was not performed for the SGH Citrix servers, indicating a gap in the security assessment of these non-mission-critical systems."
How did the SingHealth network's internet connection serve as an 'avenue of entry and exit' for the attacker?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet provided a pathway for the attacker to both enter the network and potentially exfiltrate data. This means the internet connection acted as a gateway, allowing external access into the internal network infrastructure."
What was 'Workstation A' in the context of the attack?,"'Workstation A' was an internet-connected workstation within the SingHealth network that the attacker used as a point of entry. By compromising this workstation, the attacker was able to gain access to the broader network and subsequently move towards the SCM database."
What was the consequence of the attacker using an internet-connected workstation to gain entry?,"By using an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A) to gain entry to the network, the attacker was able to establish a foothold within the SingHealth IT infrastructure. From this initial point of access, the attacker could then navigate the network and proceed towards the SCM database to steal medical data."
"When were security risks from internet connectivity first raised, and to whom?",The security risks arising from internet-connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) to the Ministry of Health (MOH) from as early as August 2015.
What was the determined approach to internet access for staff by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For those staff who did require internet access, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which was planned to be a 'remote browser'."
What is a 'remote browser' in the context of secure internet access?,"A 'remote browser' is a type of secure internet access platform. In this context, it was intended to be the method through which staff requiring internet access for work would connect, implying a more controlled and potentially isolated browsing environment compared to direct internet access."
What vulnerability allowed the attacker to install a hacking tool on Workstation A?,The attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation.
"When was the hacking tool installed on Workstation A, and what enabled its installation?","The hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. Its installation was enabled by the attacker exploiting a vulnerability present in the version of the Outlook application that was installed on the workstation."
What was the availability of a patch for the Outlook vulnerability?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017."
What is the implication of a 'clear need to improve software upgrade policies'?,"A 'clear need to improve software upgrade policies' indicates that the current practices for updating software, specifically applying patches to address vulnerabilities, were insufficient. This failure to update software in a timely manner allowed the attacker to exploit a known vulnerability."
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These IOCs provided evidence of malicious activity originating from external command and control infrastructure.
What are 'overseas C2 servers' and what was their general use?,"'Overseas C2 servers' are Command and Control servers located outside the country. Generally, these servers were used for infection (dropping malware), data exfiltration (sending technical data), and beaconing (maintaining communication with infected machines)."
Explain the 'Infection' function of C2 servers.,The 'Infection' function of C2 servers means that the server is used as a means of dropping malware into the system it is trying to infect. This is a primary step in compromising a target system.
What is 'Data exfiltration' in the context of C2 servers?,"'Data exfiltration' refers to the act of sending technical data to the C2 servers. This is a common objective for attackers, as it involves stealing sensitive information from the compromised network."
What is the purpose of 'beacon' communication from infected machines to C2 servers?,"The purpose of 'beacon' communication is for infected machines to connect to C2 servers and establish a 'heartbeat'. This refers to a slow, rhythmic communication that is meant to sustain the connection between the infected machine and the command and control infrastructure, allowing for continued control and communication."
Compare the monitoring of SCM databases with SGH Citrix servers.,"The SCM database was treated as mission critical, implying it likely received more robust monitoring. In contrast, the SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission critical and were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from them."
What security gap was highlighted by the lack of DAM implementation?,"The lack of Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) implementation at IHiS at the time of the attack highlighted a significant security gap. DAM solutions are designed to monitor database activities, and their absence meant that unusual queries and access patterns might have gone undetected."
How did the compromise of SGH Citrix servers facilitate access to the SCM database?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with a pathway to gain access to the SCM database. This was possible due to the servers not being adequately secured, specifically with the availability of alternative login methods without two-factor authentication."
What is the implication of 'Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means' for accessing SGH Citrix servers?,"This implies that while there might have been a system for managing privileged access, it was not the only way to gain access to the SGH Citrix servers. Other, potentially less secure, methods were available and utilized, creating vulnerabilities."
What security measure was missing to prevent unauthorized remote access via RDP to SGH Citrix servers?,The security measure that was missing to prevent unauthorized remote access via RDP to the SGH Citrix servers was firewalls. The absence of these firewalls allowed for easier external access to the servers.
What does it mean for SGH Citrix servers to be 'not mission critical'?,"When SGH Citrix servers are described as 'not mission critical,' it suggests they were not considered essential for the core operations of the organization. This perception might have led to them receiving less stringent security measures and monitoring compared to systems deemed mission critical."
How did the attacker leverage internet connectivity to reach the SCM database?,"The attacker leveraged the SingHealth network's internet connectivity to gain entry into the network via an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A). From this initial access point, the attacker was able to navigate the network and eventually reach the SCM database to steal medical data."
What was the determined policy for staff internet access by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the policy determined for staff internet access was to remove it for those who did not require it for work. For those who did require it, access would be through a secure internet access platform, specifically a 'remote browser'."
What specific software vulnerability was exploited to install the hacking tool?,The specific software vulnerability that was exploited to install the hacking tool was a flaw in the version of the Outlook application installed on Workstation A.
What is the significance of a patch being available since late-2017 for the Outlook vulnerability?,"The significance of a patch being available since late-2017 for the Outlook vulnerability is that a solution existed to prevent the exploit. The fact that the attack occurred on December 1, 2017, and the patch was available, highlights a failure in timely software patching and upgrade policies."
What are the three general uses of C2 servers mentioned?,"The three general uses of C2 servers mentioned are: Infection (dropping malware into a system), Data exfiltration (sending technical data to the servers), and Beacon (infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat' for sustained communication)."
What is the difference between 'Infection' and 'Data exfiltration' by C2 servers?,"The difference lies in their objectives. 'Infection' is the process where the C2 server is used to introduce malware into a system. 'Data exfiltration,' on the other hand, is the process of stealing sensitive technical data from the compromised system and sending it to the C2 servers."
How does a 'heartbeat' from an infected machine relate to C2 servers?,"A 'heartbeat' from an infected machine to C2 servers is a slow, rhythmic communication. Its purpose is to sustain the connection between the infected machine and the C2 server, ensuring that the server can maintain control over the compromised system and communicate with it as needed."
