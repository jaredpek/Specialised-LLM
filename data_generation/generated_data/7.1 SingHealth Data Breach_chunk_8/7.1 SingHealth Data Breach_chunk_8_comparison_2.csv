What are the differences between Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM)?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are designed to monitor database activities, which can address gaps in security. Privileged Access Management (PAM) refers to the control and monitoring of accounts with elevated privileges. The document mentions that DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack, and that Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing SGH Citrix servers, with logins possible without 2-factor authentication."
Explain the role of Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) in cybersecurity.,Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are available on the market and can address some or all of the security gaps highlighted. Their primary function is to monitor activities within a database.
What does RDP stand for and what is its function?,RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. It is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection.
What were the security implications of the SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database. This was partly due to Privileged Access Management not being the exclusive means for accessing these servers, allowing logins by other means without 2-factor authentication. Additionally, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and used this alternative route for convenience. There was also a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers."
Describe the security vulnerabilities related to the SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for access, and logins were possible without 2-factor authentication. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this less secure alternative route for convenience. Furthermore, there was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)."
What is vulnerability scanning and how was it applied to SGH Citrix servers?,"Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify gaps in security. While vulnerability scanning was carried out for mission-critical systems, it was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers. The SGH Citrix servers were also not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from them, unlike the SCM database."
How did internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increase the attack surface?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while serving operational needs, created an avenue of entry and exit for attackers. This allowed an attacker to use an internet-connected workstation to gain entry to the network and subsequently access the SCM database to steal medical data."
What were the security risks associated with internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network?,"The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH as early as August 2015. By June 2017, it was determined that internet access should be removed for staff who did not require it for work. For staff who did require internet access for work, it was to be provided through a secure internet access platform, such as a 'remote browser'."
What was the issue with the versions of Outlook used by IHiS?,"The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. This allowed the attacker to install the hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the Outlook application. A patch that could have prevented this vulnerability was available since late-2017, indicating a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."

Define 'Beacon' as it relates to C2 infrastructure.,"In the context of C2 infrastructure, 'Beacon' refers to the connection of infected machines to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A heartbeat is described as a slow, rhythmic communication meant just to sustain communications."
What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and how were they relevant to the C2 infrastructure?,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are a number of network elements that reveal a potential security breach. CSA's forensic analysis revealed IOCs that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These C2 servers were generally used for infection, data exfiltration, and beaconing."
Compare the monitoring of SCM databases with the monitoring of SGH Citrix servers.,"The SCM database was not monitored for unusual queries and access, and it was treated as mission-critical. In contrast, the SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical and were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. While DAM solutions could address monitoring gaps, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was the significance of the SGH Citrix servers' compromise?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with access to the SCM database. This access was facilitated by security weaknesses in the Citrix servers, including the lack of exclusive reliance on Privileged Access Management and the absence of 2-factor authentication for all logins."
What security measures were lacking for the SGH Citrix servers regarding remote access?,There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to the SGH Citrix servers. This contributed to the overall inadequate security of these servers.
What is the definition of 'attack surface' in the context of the SingHealth IT network?,"The 'attack surface' refers to the sum of the different points (the 'surface') where an unauthorized user (an 'attacker') can try to enter or extract data from an environment. In the context of the SingHealth IT network, internet connectivity increased this attack surface by creating an avenue of entry and exit for attackers."
What actions were planned by June 2017 regarding internet access for staff?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For staff who did require internet access for work, it was to be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was planned to take the form of a 'remote browser'."
What was the consequence of the unpatched Outlook versions used by IHiS?,"The consequence of the unpatched Outlook versions was that the attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in the specific version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation."
What is the purpose of C2 servers in a cyberattack?,"C2 (Command and Control) servers are used by attackers to manage compromised systems. Generally, they are used for 'Infection' (dropping malware), 'Data exfiltration' (sending technical data out), and 'Beacon' (maintaining communication with infected machines through a 'heartbeat')."
What is the difference between 'Infection' and 'Beacon' in C2 infrastructure?,"'Infection' in C2 infrastructure refers to the server being used to drop malware into a system. 'Beacon', on the other hand, refers to infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat', which is a slow, rhythmic communication to sustain communications."
