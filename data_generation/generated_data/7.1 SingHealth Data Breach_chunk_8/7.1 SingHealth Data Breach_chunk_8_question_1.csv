What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding C2 servers?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers.
What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log files or network traffic, that indicate a potential intrusion into a computer network or system."
What were the general uses of the C2 servers identified?,"The C2 servers were generally used for three main purposes: Infection, Data exfiltration, and Beacon."
What is meant by 'Infection' in the context of C2 servers?,"Infection, in the context of C2 servers, refers to the use of the server as a means of dropping malware into a system that it is trying to infect."
What is 'Data exfiltration' in relation to C2 servers?,"Data exfiltration, in relation to C2 servers, refers to the process where technical data is sent from compromised systems to these servers."
What is a 'Beacon' in the context of C2 servers?,"A 'Beacon' refers to the connection established by infected machines to C2 servers. This connection is characterized by a slow, rhythmic communication, often called a 'heartbeat', which is meant to sustain the communications between the infected machine and the C2 server."
What is the SCM database?,"The SCM database is a critical database that was accessed by the attacker. Its compromise was a key objective, and its security was managed differently from the SGH Citrix servers."
What is the role of Privileged Access Management (PAM)?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a security concept related to controlling and monitoring access to sensitive systems and data. In the context of the SGH Citrix servers, it was noted that PAM was not the exclusive means for accessing these servers, which allowed for alternative, less secure access methods."
What is 2-factor authentication?,2-factor authentication is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a security token or a phone).
What is the significance of 'convenience' for IHiS Citrix administrators?,"The mention of 'convenience' for IHiS Citrix administrators in relation to using alternative access routes to SGH Citrix servers suggests that security protocols were bypassed for ease of use, indicating a potential lapse in security practices."
What is the relationship between firewalls and unauthorized remote access?,Firewalls are security systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. The lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers meant that such access was not adequately blocked.
What is Microsoft?,Microsoft is the company that developed the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). RDP is a proprietary network communication protocol that allows remote control of another computer over a network.
What does it mean for a server to be 'mission critical'?,"A 'mission critical' system or server is one that is essential for the core operations and functioning of an organization. Downtime or compromise of such systems would have severe consequences. The SGH Citrix servers were not treated as mission critical, unlike the SCM database."
What are 'vulnerabilities' in the context of servers?,"Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a server or system that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or steal data. The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for vulnerabilities."
What is an 'attack surface'?,"An attack surface refers to the sum of the different points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user (an ""attacker"") can try to enter or extract data from an information system. Increased internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network expanded this attack surface."
What is 'Workstation A' in the context of the attack?,Workstation A was an internet-connected workstation that the attacker used as an entry point into the SingHealth network.
