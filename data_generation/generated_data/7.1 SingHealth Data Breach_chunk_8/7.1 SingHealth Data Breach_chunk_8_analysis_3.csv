Analyse the implementation of Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions with respect to the gaps highlighted in the document.,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are available on the market and could address some or all of the three gaps highlighted. However, it is noted that DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of SGH Citrix servers' security?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing these servers, and logins were possible through other means without 2-factor authentication. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and used it for convenience. Furthermore, there was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers."
Explain the role of SGH Citrix servers in the attack.,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in providing the attacker with access to the SCM database. This was facilitated by inadequate security measures, including the availability of alternative login methods without 2-factor authentication and a lack of firewalls for RDP access."
Define 'Privileged Access Management' in the context of SGH Citrix server security.,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) refers to a cybersecurity strategy that controls, monitors, and secures accounts with elevated access or privileges. In the context of SGH Citrix servers, PAM was not the exclusive means for accessing them, indicating a security gap where other, less secure methods were also available."
What was the issue with logins to SGH Citrix servers?,"Logins to the SGH Citrix servers were possible through means other than Privileged Access Management, and crucially, these alternative methods did not require 2-factor authentication. This presented a significant security vulnerability."
Describe the awareness and usage of alternative login routes by IHiS Citrix administrators.,IHiS Citrix administrators were not only aware of the alternative routes for logging into the SGH Citrix servers (which bypassed standard security measures like 2-factor authentication) but also made use of these routes for convenience.
Explain the vulnerability related to RDP access on SGH Citrix servers.,There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to the SGH Citrix servers. This allowed for potential unauthorized remote connections.
Define RDP and its function.,RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. It is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection.
What were the observations regarding the overall management of SGH Citrix servers?,"The SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. They were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. Additionally, vulnerability scanning, which was performed for mission-critical systems, was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers."
Define 'Vulnerability scanning' in the context of server security.,Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer to identify gaps in security. This process helps in uncovering weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
Compare the monitoring and security practices for SGH Citrix servers versus SCM database.,"SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues, and vulnerability scanning was not performed on them. In contrast, they were treated as not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database, implying that the SCM database likely received more stringent monitoring and security attention."
How did internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network affect the attack surface?,"Internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increased the attack surface. While serving operational needs, the network's connection to the internet created an avenue of entry and exit for the attacker."
Explain how the attacker gained initial entry into the SingHealth network.,The attacker made use of an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A) to gain entry into the network. This workstation served as the initial point of access before the attacker proceeded towards the SCM database.
What were the security risks associated with internet connectivity in the SingHealth network?,"The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were significant. These risks were raised by CSA to MOH as early as August 2015, indicating a recognized vulnerability."
What measures were determined by the healthcare sector regarding internet access by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for work. For staff who did require internet access for work, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was planned to take the form of a 'remote browser'."
Define 'remote browser' in the context of secure internet access.,"A 'remote browser' is a secure internet access platform designed to provide internet access to staff who require it for work, while mitigating security risks. It is a method to isolate internet browsing activities from the internal network."
Analyze the vulnerability related to Outlook versions used by IHiS.,"The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. This allowed the attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the Outlook application installed on Workstation A to install the hacking tool on December 1, 2017."
Describe how the attacker installed the hacking tool on Workstation A.,"The attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability present in the version of the Outlook application that was installed on that workstation."
What was the status of the patch for the Outlook vulnerability?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017. This indicates that the vulnerability could have been mitigated."
What is the implication of the unpatched Outlook versions?,"The unpatched versions of Outlook used by IHiS created a significant security gap, allowing an attacker to exploit a known vulnerability to install a hacking tool. This highlights a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
What is the significance of 'extensive C2 infrastructure' in the context of the breach?,"The presence of extensive C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure indicates a sophisticated attack. CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers, which were used by the attacker for various malicious activities."
Define 'Indicators of Compromise' (IOCs).,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log files or running processes, that indicate a computer intrusion. In this context, IOCs revealed the presence of overseas C2 servers."
What were the primary uses of the overseas C2 servers identified?,"The overseas C2 servers were generally used for three main purposes: Infection, where the server was used to drop malware into the system; Data exfiltration, where technical data was sent to the servers; and Beaconing, where infected machines connected to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat' for sustained communication."
Explain the function of 'Infection' in relation to C2 servers.,"Infection, in the context of C2 servers, refers to the use of the server as a means of dropping malware into a system that the attacker is trying to infect. This is a method for initial compromise or spreading of malicious software."
Describe 'Data exfiltration' as a function of C2 servers.,"Data exfiltration, in relation to C2 servers, refers to the process where technical data is sent from compromised systems to these servers. This is a common objective for attackers seeking to steal sensitive information."
Define 'Beacon' in the context of C2 server communication.,"Beacon, in the context of C2 servers, refers to the connection established by infected machines to these servers. This connection is characterized by a 'heartbeat', which is a slow, rhythmic communication pattern used to sustain the communication channel between the compromised machine and the attacker's infrastructure."
What was the critical factor that allowed the attacker access to the SCM database?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database. This compromise was facilitated by inadequate security measures on the Citrix servers.
Analyze the security implications of 'Privileged Access Management' not being the exclusive means for accessing SGH Citrix servers.,"When Privileged Access Management is not the exclusive means for accessing servers, it implies that other, potentially less secure, methods are available. In the case of SGH Citrix servers, this meant that logins were possible without the stringent controls typically associated with PAM, and crucially, without 2-factor authentication."
What does it mean for logins to servers to be possible 'without 2-factor authentication'?,"Logins to servers without 2-factor authentication mean that only a single form of verification, such as a password, was required to gain access. 2-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second, independent piece of evidence (like a code from a mobile device) to verify the user's identity, making unauthorized access much more difficult."
Explain the convenience factor exploited by IHiS Citrix administrators.,"The convenience factor exploited by IHiS Citrix administrators refers to their use of alternative, less secure routes for logging into the SGH Citrix servers. These routes bypassed standard security protocols, likely saving them time and effort, but at the cost of significantly weakening the overall security posture."
What is the cybersecurity significance of 'lack of firewalls' for RDP access?,"A lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP means that there are no network security devices in place to block or control incoming RDP connections. This leaves the servers vulnerable to direct, potentially malicious, remote access attempts from external networks."
How were SGH Citrix servers managed in terms of criticality?,"The SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical. This classification likely contributed to them receiving less rigorous security monitoring and maintenance compared to systems deemed mission-critical, such as the SCM database."
What was the consequence of SGH Citrix servers not being monitored for real-time analysis and alerts?,The lack of real-time monitoring and alerts for vulnerabilities and issues on the SGH Citrix servers meant that potential security threats or system weaknesses were not detected promptly. This allowed vulnerabilities to persist and potentially be exploited by attackers without immediate detection.
Why was vulnerability scanning not carried out for SGH Citrix servers?,"Vulnerability scanning was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers because they were treated as not mission-critical. Vulnerability scanning was, however, performed for mission-critical systems, indicating a disparity in security practices based on perceived system importance."
How did the SingHealth network's internet connection facilitate the attack?,The SingHealth network's connection to the internet provided an 'avenue of entry and exit' for the attacker. This means the internet connection served as a pathway for the attacker to infiltrate the network and potentially exfiltrate data.
Describe the attacker's path after gaining entry to the SingHealth network.,"After gaining entry to the network via an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A), the attacker made their way to the SCM database with the objective of stealing medical data."
When were the security risks of internet connectivity in the SingHealth network first raised?,The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH from as early as August 2015.
What was the proposed solution for staff requiring internet access for work by June 2017?,"By June 2017, it was determined that for staff who required internet access for work, this access would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which was to take the form of a 'remote browser'."
What was the action taken for staff who did not require internet access for work?,"For staff who did not require the internet for work, internet access would be removed. This measure aimed to reduce the attack surface by limiting unnecessary internet connectivity."
Analyze the impact of unpatched Outlook versions on cybersecurity.,"Unpatched Outlook versions created a critical vulnerability that allowed the attacker to install a publicly available hacking tool on December 1, 2017. This highlights the severe security risks associated with not applying available software patches promptly."
What is the significance of a 'publicly available hacking tool' in this context?,"The use of a 'publicly available hacking tool' implies that the exploit was not a highly sophisticated or custom-developed attack. It suggests that the vulnerability was known and that tools to exploit it were readily accessible, making the failure to patch even more critical."
What does the availability of a patch 'since late-2017' imply?,The fact that an effective patch was available since late-2017 implies that the vulnerability was known and a solution was developed. The failure to implement this patch on the affected systems (like the Outlook application on Workstation A) meant that the organization remained exposed to the attack.
What is the 'clear need' identified regarding software management?,"The situation clearly indicates a need to improve software upgrade policies. This includes ensuring that software is regularly patched and updated to address known vulnerabilities, especially for systems that are connected to the network."
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal about C2 servers?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These servers were utilized by the attacker for malicious activities.
What is the general purpose of C2 servers in cyberattacks?,"Generally, C2 servers are used by attackers to control compromised systems. In this case, they were used for infection (deploying malware), data exfiltration (stealing data), and beaconing (maintaining communication with infected machines)."
How did the attacker use Workstation A in the breach?,The attacker used Workstation A as an initial point of entry into the SingHealth network. They were able to install a hacking tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the Outlook application installed on it.
What was the ultimate goal of the attacker after gaining network access?,"After gaining entry to the network, the attacker's ultimate goal was to make their way to the SCM database to steal the medical data."
