For staff who did require internet access for work, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was to be a 'remote browser'."
What vulnerability allowed the attacker to install a hacking tool on Workstation A?,The attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation.
"When was the hacking tool installed on Workstation A, and what was the method of installation?","The hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the Outlook application."
Was a patch available to prevent the exploitation of the Outlook vulnerability?,"Yes, a patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017."
What was identified as a clear need regarding software management?,There was a clear need to improve software upgrade policies.
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers.
"What are C2 servers generally used for, according to CSA?","Generally, C2 servers were used for infection, data exfiltration, and beaconing."
Define 'Infection' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Infection, in the context of C2 server usage, is when a server is used as a means of dropping malware into a system it is trying to infect."
Define 'Data exfiltration' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Data exfiltration, in the context of C2 server usage, involves indications of technical data being sent to the servers."
Define 'Beacon' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Beacon, in the context of C2 server usage, refers to infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A heartbeat is a slow, rhythmic communication meant to sustain communications."
What is the definition of a 'heartbeat' in the context of C2 server communications?,"A 'heartbeat' refers to a slow, rhythmic communication between infected machines and C2 servers, meant solely to sustain communications."
What was the primary issue with monitoring at the SCM database?,The primary issue was the lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access.
What type of solutions could address the gaps highlighted regarding database monitoring?,Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions available on the market could address some or all of the three gaps highlighted.
What was the state of SGH Citrix servers' security against unauthorized access?,SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access.
What was the consequence of the SGH Citrix servers being compromised?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What alternative login methods were possible for SGH Citrix servers besides Privileged Access Management?,"Logins to the SGH Citrix servers were possible by other means without two-factor authentication, indicating that Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive method."
What was the reason IHiS Citrix administrators used alternative access routes?,IHiS Citrix administrators used the alternative access routes for convenience.
What security measure was missing to prevent unauthorized remote access via RDP to SGH Citrix servers?,There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers.
What does 'RDP' stand for and what is its function?,RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. It is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection.
How were SGH Citrix servers treated in terms of their importance?,SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission critical.
What kind of analysis and alerts were not being performed for SGH Citrix servers?,The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from them.
"What security practice was not applied to SGH Citrix servers, despite being done for other systems?","Vulnerability scanning, which was carried out for mission-critical systems, was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers."
What is the purpose of vulnerability scanning?,Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer to identify gaps in security.
