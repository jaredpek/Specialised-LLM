Define the concept of Database Activity Monitoring (DAM).,Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions designed to monitor database activities. These solutions can address various security gaps by tracking and analyzing database operations.
What was the status of DAM implementation by IHiS at the time of the attack?,"At the time of the attack, DAM was not implemented by IHiS."
Explain the criticality of the SGH Citrix servers' compromise.,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with access to the SCM database.
Describe the security vulnerabilities related to accessing SGH Citrix servers.,Access to SGH Citrix servers was not exclusively managed through Privileged Access Management. Logins to the servers were possible through other means that did not require two-factor authentication. This alternative route was known to and utilized by IHiS Citrix administrators for convenience.
What was the issue with firewalls and remote access to SGH Citrix servers?,There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access to the SGH Citrix servers using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
Define RDP in the context of cybersecurity.,"In cybersecurity, RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol. It is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection."
How were SGH Citrix servers managed in terms of criticality?,"The SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database."
What monitoring was lacking for the SGH Citrix servers?,The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts regarding vulnerabilities and issues arising from them.
Explain the concept of vulnerability scanning and its application to SGH Citrix servers.,"Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify security gaps. While vulnerability scanning was performed for mission-critical systems, it was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers."
How did internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network affect the attack surface?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while serving operational needs, created an avenue for the attacker to enter and exit the network, thereby increasing the attack surface."
Describe how an attacker could gain entry to the SingHealth network.,"An attacker could gain entry to the network by using an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A). From there, the attacker could proceed to the SCM database to steal medical data."
When were the security risks of internet connectivity in the SingHealth network first raised?,The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH as early as August 2015.
What measures were determined by the healthcare sector regarding internet access by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for work. For staff who did require internet access for work, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was to be a 'remote browser'."
What was the issue with the versions of Outlook used by IHiS?,The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool.
How was a hacking tool installed on Workstation A?,"The attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation."
When was a patch available to prevent the exploitation of the Outlook vulnerability?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017."
What was identified as a clear need regarding software management?,There was a clear need to improve software upgrade policies.
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding C2 infrastructure?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers.
What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are a number of network elements that forensic analysis revealed, which in this context appeared to be overseas C2 servers."
What were the general uses of C2 servers identified by CSA?,"Generally, C2 servers were used for infection, data exfiltration, and beaconing."
Explain the function of 'Infection' in relation to C2 servers.,Infection refers to the use of a server as a means of dropping malware into a system it is trying to infect.
Describe 'Data exfiltration' in the context of C2 servers.,Data exfiltration involves indications of technical data being sent to the C2 servers.
What is a 'beacon' in the context of infected machines and C2 servers?,"A beacon occurs when infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A heartbeat refers to a slow, rhythmic communication meant to sustain communications."
What was the primary issue with monitoring at the SCM database?,The primary issue was the lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access.
What type of solutions could address the gaps highlighted regarding database monitoring?,Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions available on the market could address some or all of the three gaps highlighted.
What was the consequence of the SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured?,The SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured against unauthorized access was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What alternative method of accessing SGH Citrix servers existed besides Privileged Access Management?,"Logins to the SGH Citrix servers by other means without two-factor authentication were possible, meaning Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means of access."
Who was aware of and used the alternative access route to SGH Citrix servers?,IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and made use of it for convenience.
What security measure was missing to prevent unauthorized remote access to SGH Citrix servers via RDP?,There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers.
What is the definition of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)?,Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection.
How did the management of SGH Citrix servers differ from the SCM database?,"SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission critical, unlike the SCM database."
What kind of analysis and alerts were missing for the SGH Citrix servers?,The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from these servers.
"What security practice was not applied to SGH Citrix servers, despite being used for other systems?","Vulnerability scanning, which was carried out for mission-critical systems, was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers."
What is the purpose of vulnerability scanning?,Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of the potential points of exploit on a computer to identify gaps in security.
How did the SingHealth IT network's internet connectivity impact security?,Internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increased the attack surface by creating an avenue of entry and exit for attackers.
What was the attacker's initial entry point into the SingHealth network?,The attacker made use of an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A) to gain entry to the network.
What was the ultimate target of the attacker after gaining network entry?,"After gaining entry to the network, the attacker made his way to the SCM database to steal the medical data."
"Who was informed about the security risks of internet connectivity in the SingHealth network, and when?",The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH from as early as August 2015.
What was the decision made by the healthcare sector regarding internet access for staff by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for work.
