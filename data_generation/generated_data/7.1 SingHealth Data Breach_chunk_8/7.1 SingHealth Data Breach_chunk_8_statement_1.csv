For staff who did require internet access for work, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was planned to be a 'remote browser'."
What was the issue with the versions of Outlook used by IHiS?,The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool.
How was the hacking tool installed on Workstation A?,"The attacker was able to install the publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation."
When was a patch available to prevent the exploitation of the Outlook vulnerability?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017."
What is the implication of the unpatched Outlook versions?,The situation highlights a clear need to improve software upgrade policies.
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding C2 infrastructure?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers.
What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are network artifacts or data that indicate a potential security breach or intrusion.
What were the general uses of C2 servers identified by CSA?,"Generally, C2 servers were used for infection (dropping malware into a system), data exfiltration (sending technical data to the servers), and beaconing (infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat' for sustained communication)."
Explain the function of C2 servers in the context of infection.,"In the context of infection, a C2 server is used as a means of dropping malware into the system it is trying to infect."
What is data exfiltration in relation to C2 servers?,"Data exfiltration, in relation to C2 servers, involves indications of technical data being sent to these servers."
Describe the 'beacon' function of C2 servers.,"The 'beacon' function involves infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A heartbeat refers to a slow, rhythmic communication meant to sustain communications."
What was the primary issue with the SCM database regarding monitoring?,There was a lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access.
What type of solutions could address the gaps in monitoring?,Database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions available on the market could address some or all of the highlighted gaps.
What was the critical factor that allowed the attacker access to the SCM database?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
Were SGH Citrix servers exclusively accessed via Privileged Access Management?,"No, Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. Logins were possible through other means without two-factor authentication."
What was the reason IHiS Citrix administrators used alternative access routes?,IHiS Citrix administrators used alternative access routes for convenience.
What security measure was missing to prevent unauthorized remote access via RDP to SGH Citrix servers?,There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP to the SGH Citrix servers.
Who developed the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)?,The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) was developed by Microsoft.
What is the function of RDP?,RDP enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection.
How did the management of SGH Citrix servers differ from the SCM database?,"SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical, whereas the SCM database was considered mission-critical."
What kind of analysis and alerts were missing for SGH Citrix servers?,SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from them.
What security practice was performed on mission-critical systems but not on SGH Citrix servers?,Vulnerability scanning was carried out for mission-critical systems but not for the SGH Citrix servers.
What is the purpose of vulnerability scanning?,Vulnerability scanning is performed to inspect potential points of exploit on a computer to identify security gaps.
How did the SingHealth network's internet connectivity contribute to the attack?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the internet created an avenue of entry and exit for the attacker, thereby increasing the attack surface."
What was the initial entry point for the attacker into the network?,The attacker used an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A) to gain entry to the network.
What was the ultimate target of the attacker after gaining network access?,"After gaining network access, the attacker made their way to the SCM database to steal medical data."
"Who was informed about the security risks of internet connectivity in the SingHealth network, and when?",CSA informed MOH about the security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network as early as August 2015.
What was the proposed secure internet access method for staff who needed internet access for work?,"For staff who required internet access for work, it was proposed that access would be through a secure internet access platform, which was to take the form of a 'remote browser'."
