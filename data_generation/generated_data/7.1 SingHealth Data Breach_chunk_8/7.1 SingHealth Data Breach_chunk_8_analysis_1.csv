Analyse the role of Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions in addressing security gaps.,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are designed to monitor and address security gaps related to database access and queries. These solutions can detect unusual activities and provide alerts, thereby enhancing the security posture of databases. However, it is noted that DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What were the security implications of SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured?,"The inadequate security of SGH Citrix servers was critical in granting the attacker access to the SCM database. This was due to Privileged Access Management not being the sole method for accessing these servers, allowing logins through other means without two-factor authentication. Furthermore, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this alternative route for convenience."
Explain the vulnerability related to SGH Citrix servers and unauthorized remote access.,"SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, specifically due to a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP. RDP, which stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection."
Describe the monitoring practices for SGH Citrix servers compared to the SCM database.,"Unlike the SCM database, SGH Citrix servers were not treated as mission-critical. Consequently, they were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts regarding vulnerabilities and issues. Additionally, vulnerability scanning, which was performed for mission-critical systems, was not conducted for the SGH Citrix servers."
Define vulnerability scanning and its relevance to server security.,"Vulnerability scanning is an inspection process focused on identifying potential points of exploit on a computer. Its purpose is to detect and highlight gaps in security. This process is crucial for maintaining the security of systems, especially those considered mission-critical."
How did internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network contribute to the attack surface?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while necessary for operational needs, inadvertently created an avenue for the attacker to enter and exit the network.

Its function is to enable a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection."
How were SGH Citrix servers managed in terms of criticality?,"SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical. This classification contrasted with the SCM database, which was considered mission-critical. This lower perceived criticality influenced the level of monitoring and security applied to the Citrix servers."
What was the monitoring status of SGH Citrix servers for real-time analysis?,The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis. This lack of continuous monitoring meant that alerts for vulnerabilities and other issues arising from these servers were not generated or acted upon promptly.
What is the definition of 'attack surface' in the context of IT networks?,"The 'attack surface' of an IT network refers to the sum of all the different points (or 'attack vectors') where an unauthorized user (an attacker) can try to enter, interact with, or extract data from a system. Increased internet connectivity can expand this surface."
How did the SingHealth network's internet connectivity increase the attack surface?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while serving operational needs, created an avenue for attackers to enter and exit the network. This direct link to the external internet expanded the potential points of vulnerability, thereby increasing the overall attack surface."
What was the timeline for raising security risks of internet connectivity in the SingHealth network?,The security risks associated with internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA (Cyber Security Agency) to MOH (Ministry of Health) as early as August 2015. This indicates that the potential dangers were identified well in advance of the breach.
What was the determined approach to internet access for staff by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access should be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For staff who did require internet access, it was to be provided through a secure internet access platform, specifically a 'remote browser'."
What is a 'remote browser' in the context of secure internet access?,"A 'remote browser' is a type of secure internet access platform. In the context of the healthcare sector's determined approach by June 2017, it was intended to be the form of access for staff who required internet connectivity for their work, providing a more controlled and secure environment."

What was the specific vulnerability exploited to install the hacking tool?,"The specific vulnerability exploited to install the hacking tool was found in the version of the Outlook application installed on Workstation A. The attacker leveraged this vulnerability to gain access and install the tool on December 1, 2017."
What is the implication of 'Versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched'?,The statement 'Versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool' implies that the Outlook software on the affected systems had known vulnerabilities that were not addressed through updates or patches. This allowed an attacker to exploit these weaknesses.
What is the definition of 'Indicators of Compromise' (IOCs)?,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log files or network traffic, that indicate a potential intrusion or a system compromise. CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network IOCs that pointed to overseas C2 servers."
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal about C2 servers?,"CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These servers were generally used by the attacker for activities such as infection, data exfiltration, and establishing communication beacons."
What is the definition of 'overseas C2 servers'?,'Overseas C2 servers' refers to Command and Control servers that are located outside the country or jurisdiction where the compromised systems are located. These servers are used by attackers to manage and direct their malicious activities remotely.
What was the overall security posture of SGH Citrix servers?,"The overall security posture of SGH Citrix servers was inadequate. They were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, lacked proper monitoring for real-time analysis and alerts, and were not subjected to vulnerability scanning. Furthermore, access controls were not strictly enforced, allowing for less secure login methods."
What was the consequence of SGH Citrix servers not being mission-critical?,"Because SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical, they did not receive the same level of security attention as systems like the SCM database. This resulted in them not being monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities, and vulnerability scanning was not performed on them."
What is the definition of 'vulnerability scanning'?,Vulnerability scanning is the process of inspecting a computer or network for potential security weaknesses. It involves identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. The goal is to find and fix security gaps.
How did the attacker gain entry to the SingHealth network?,"The attacker gained entry to the SingHealth network by making use of an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A). This workstation served as the initial point of access, from which the attacker then proceeded towards the SCM database."
What was the purpose of the 'heartbeat' communication from infected machines to C2 servers?,"The 'heartbeat' communication from infected machines to C2 servers refers to a slow, rhythmic communication pattern. Its sole purpose is to sustain the ongoing communications between the compromised machine and the C2 server, ensuring the connection remains active."
What is the relationship between internet connectivity and attack surface?,"Internet connectivity in an IT network directly influences its attack surface. While essential for operations, each internet connection point can serve as a potential avenue for attackers to enter or interact with the network. Therefore, increased internet connectivity generally leads to a larger attack surface."
What action was taken regarding internet access for staff who did not require it for work?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. This was a measure to reduce the attack surface and mitigate security risks associated with unnecessary internet exposure."
What was the proposed method for secure internet access for staff who needed it?,"For staff who required internet access for their work, the determined approach by June 2017 was to provide access through a secure internet access platform. At that time, this platform was planned to take the form of a 'remote browser'."
What is the significance of a 'publicly available hacking tool' in the context of the breach?,"The use of a 'publicly available hacking tool' signifies that the attacker did not need to develop sophisticated, custom malware. Instead, they utilized readily accessible tools, exploiting known vulnerabilities in unpatched software (like Outlook) to compromise systems, which points to a failure in basic security hygiene."
What is the implication of a patch being available since late-2017?,"The fact that a patch effective against the exploited Outlook vulnerability was available since late-2017 implies that IHiS failed to implement timely software updates. This delay allowed the vulnerability to remain unaddressed, enabling the attacker to successfully install the hacking tool."
What does 'extensive C2 infrastructure' suggest about the attacker's capabilities?,"An 'extensive C2 infrastructure' suggests that the attacker possessed significant resources and planning capabilities. It indicates a well-organized operation capable of managing multiple compromised systems remotely, facilitating complex attacks like data exfiltration and persistent control over infected machines."
What were the identified uses of overseas C2 servers?,"The overseas C2 servers identified by CSA's forensic analysis were generally used for three main purposes: Infection (deploying malware), Data exfiltration (transferring technical data), and Beacon (maintaining communication with compromised machines via a 'heartbeat')."
