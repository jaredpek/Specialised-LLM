Provide a comprehensive summary of the lack of monitoring at the SCM database.,"The SCM database lacked monitoring for unusual queries and access. While database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions exist in the market to address such gaps, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
Summarize the security vulnerabilities related to SGH Citrix servers.,"SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in granting the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing these servers, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this alternative route for convenience."
Explain the lack of firewalls for remote access to SGH Citrix servers.,"There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access to the SGH Citrix servers using RDP. RDP, which stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to remotely connect to and control another computer over a network connection."
Describe the observations regarding the overall management of SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not treated as mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. They were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts regarding vulnerabilities and issues. Furthermore, vulnerability scanning, which was performed on mission-critical systems, was not conducted on the SGH Citrix servers. Vulnerability scanning is defined as an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify security gaps."
Explain how internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increased the attack surface.,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while serving operational needs, created an entry and exit avenue for attackers. This allowed an attacker to use an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A) to gain network entry before proceeding to the SCM database to steal medical data."
Detail the security risks associated with internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network.,"Security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH as early as August 2015. By June 2017, it was determined that internet access would be removed for staff not requiring it for work. For staff who did require internet access for work, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was to be a 'remote browser'."
Summarize the issue with unpatched versions of Outlook used by IHiS.,"Versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Outlook application on Workstation A to install the hacking tool on December 1, 2017. A patch that could have prevented this vulnerability and tool installation was available since late 2017, highlighting a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
Explain the concept of extensive C2 infrastructure in the context of the breach.,"CSA's forensic analysis revealed network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. C2 servers, or Command and Control servers, are generally used for several purposes in a cyberattack: Infection, where the server is used to drop malware into a system; Data exfiltration, where technical data is sent to the servers; and Beacon, where infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat,' which is a slow, rhythmic communication to sustain communications."
What were the key issues with the SCM database monitoring?,"The SCM database suffered from a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access. Although database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions exist, they were not implemented by IHiS at the time of the incident."
Describe the security shortcomings of the SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This lack of security was critical as it allowed the attacker access to the SCM database. Specifically, Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive method for access, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this less secure alternative route for convenience."
What was the role of RDP in the security vulnerabilities of SGH Citrix servers?,"There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access to the SGH Citrix servers using RDP. RDP, or Remote Desktop Protocol, is a Microsoft-developed protocol that enables remote control of another computer over a network."
"How were the SGH Citrix servers managed, and what were the implications?","The SGH Citrix servers were managed as if they were not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. They were not monitored in real-time for vulnerabilities or issues. Additionally, vulnerability scanning, a process of inspecting potential security exploit points, was not performed on these servers, despite being conducted on mission-critical systems."
What was the impact of internet connectivity on the SingHealth IT network's security?,"The SingHealth IT network's connection to the Internet expanded its attack surface. This connectivity provided an avenue for attackers to enter and exit the network, which was exploited by an attacker using an internet-connected workstation to gain access before reaching the SCM database."
What measures were considered or implemented regarding internet access in the healthcare sector by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access should be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For those who did need internet access, it was to be provided through a secure internet access platform, which was planned to be a 'remote browser'."
Explain the vulnerability related to Outlook versions and patching.,"The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a known, publicly available hacking tool. This allowed an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the Outlook application on Workstation A to install the hacking tool on December 1, 2017. A patch to prevent this vulnerability was available since late 2017, indicating a need for improved software upgrade policies."
"What is a C2 infrastructure, and how was it observed in the breach?","A C2 infrastructure refers to Command and Control servers used by attackers. CSA's forensic analysis identified overseas C2 servers. These servers were used for infection (dropping malware), data exfiltration (sending technical data), and beaconing (maintaining communication with infected machines via a 'heartbeat')."
