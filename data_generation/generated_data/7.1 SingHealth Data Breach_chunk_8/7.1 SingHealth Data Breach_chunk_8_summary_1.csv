Provide a comprehensive summary of the lack of monitoring at the SCM database.,"The SCM database lacked adequate monitoring for unusual queries and access. Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are available on the market that could address these gaps. However, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
Summarize the security issues related to SGH Citrix servers.,"SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in granting the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing these servers, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and used it for convenience."
Explain the vulnerabilities associated with SGH Citrix servers regarding remote access.,"SGH Citrix servers lacked firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP. RDP, which stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft. It enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection. The absence of firewalls allowed for unauthorized remote access."
Describe the observations on the overall management of SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. They were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. Vulnerability scanning, which was performed for mission-critical systems, was not conducted for the SGH Citrix servers. Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify security gaps."
Explain how internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increased the attack surface.,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while serving operational needs, created an avenue for the attacker to enter and exit the network. This allowed the attacker to use an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A) to gain network entry before proceeding to the SCM database to steal medical data."
Detail the security risks associated with internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network.,"Security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH as early as August 2015. By June 2017, it was determined that internet access would be removed for staff who did not require it for work. For staff who did require internet access for work, it would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which was to be a 'remote browser'."
Summarize the issue with unpatched versions of Outlook used by IHiS.,"Versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. The attacker was able to install this tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the installed Outlook application. A patch that could have prevented this exploitation was available since late 2017, indicating a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
Explain the concept of C2 infrastructure in the context of the breach.,"CSA's forensic analysis revealed network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. C2 servers, or Command and Control servers, are generally used for several purposes in a cyber attack. These include: Infection, where the server is used to drop malware into a system; Data exfiltration, where technical data is sent to the servers; and Beacon, where infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat,' which is a slow, rhythmic communication to sustain communications."
What is a 'heartbeat' in the context of C2 infrastructure?,"In the context of C2 infrastructure, a 'heartbeat' refers to a slow, rhythmic communication between infected machines and C2 servers. This communication is established to sustain the connection and maintain control."
What were the key findings regarding the SCM database monitoring?,"The SCM database lacked monitoring for unusual queries and access. While Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions exist to address such gaps, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
How did the compromise of SGH Citrix servers contribute to the breach?,"The compromise of SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with access to the SCM database. This was facilitated by the fact that Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means of access, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this alternative, less secure, access route for convenience."
What was the role of RDP in the security vulnerabilities of SGH Citrix servers?,The SGH Citrix servers lacked firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). RDP is a Microsoft-developed protocol that allows remote control of another computer over a network. The absence of firewalls meant that unauthorized remote access via RDP was possible.
What were the management issues with SGH Citrix servers?,"SGH Citrix servers were not treated as mission-critical and were not monitored for real-time analysis or alerts regarding vulnerabilities and issues. Unlike mission-critical systems, vulnerability scanning was not performed on these servers. Vulnerability scanning is a process to identify security gaps by inspecting potential exploit points on a computer."
How did the SingHealth IT network's internet connectivity pose a risk?,"The SingHealth IT network's connection to the Internet, while necessary for operations, created an entry and exit point for attackers. This connectivity allowed an attacker to use an internet-connected workstation to gain access to the network and subsequently reach the SCM database to steal medical data."
What measures were considered to mitigate internet connectivity risks?,"Security risks related to internet connectivity were raised as early as August 2015. By June 2017, the decision was made to remove internet access for staff who did not require it for their work. For those who did, access was to be through a secure platform, a 'remote browser'."
What was the specific vulnerability exploited on Workstation A?,"The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on Workstation A to install a publicly available hacking tool on December 1, 2017. A patch to prevent this vulnerability was available since late 2017, highlighting a deficiency in software upgrade policies."
What is an Indicator of Compromise (IOC)?,"An Indicator of Compromise (IOC) is a piece of forensic data, such as data found in system log files or file system, that indicates a computer intrusion. In this context, IOCs revealed the presence of overseas C2 servers."
What are the typical uses of C2 servers in cyber attacks?,"C2 servers are typically used in cyber attacks for infection (dropping malware), data exfiltration (sending technical data out), and beaconing (maintaining a connection with infected machines through a 'heartbeat' communication)."
Summarize the security gaps related to the SCM database.,"The primary security gap concerning the SCM database was the lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access. Although solutions like Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) exist, they were not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was the critical role of SGH Citrix servers in the breach?,"The SGH Citrix servers played a critical role by acting as a gateway to the SCM database. Their inadequate security, including the possibility of logging in without two-factor authentication and the use of this alternative route by administrators, allowed the attacker to gain access."
Explain the implications of lacking firewalls for RDP on SGH Citrix servers.,"The absence of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP on SGH Citrix servers meant that attackers could potentially connect to and control these servers remotely without proper security controls, thereby increasing the risk of unauthorized access and compromise."
What was the security posture of SGH Citrix servers regarding monitoring and scanning?,"SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis of vulnerabilities and issues, nor were they subjected to vulnerability scanning. This contrasts with mission-critical systems, which did undergo such security checks. They were also not treated as mission-critical systems."
How did the internet connection of the SingHealth network facilitate the attack?,"The internet connection provided an entry and exit point for the attacker into the SingHealth network. The attacker leveraged an internet-connected workstation to gain initial access, which then allowed them to move towards the SCM database."
What was the timeline and nature of the decision regarding internet access for staff?,"Security risks from internet connectivity were flagged in August 2015. By June 2017, a decision was made to restrict internet access for staff who did not need it for work. For those who did, access was to be through a secure 'remote browser' platform."
What was the specific hacking tool and the vulnerability exploited?,"The attacker installed a publicly available hacking tool by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application on Workstation A. This occurred on December 1, 2017. A patch for this vulnerability had been available since late 2017."
What were the 'overseas C2 servers' and their significance?,"Overseas C2 servers were identified through forensic analysis as network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). These servers were part of the infrastructure used by the attacker to manage and control the compromised systems, facilitating actions like malware deployment and data exfiltration."
Define 'Infection' as a use of C2 servers.,"In the context of C2 server usage, 'Infection' refers to the process where the server is utilized as a method to introduce or 'drop' malware into the targeted system."
Define 'Data exfiltration' as a use of C2 servers.,'Data exfiltration' as a use of C2 servers involves the transfer of technical data from the compromised systems to the C2 servers. This is a common objective for attackers seeking to steal sensitive information.
What was the consequence of not implementing DAM solutions?,"The consequence of not implementing Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions was the lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access at the SCM database, leaving it vulnerable to undetected malicious activities."
How did the lack of 2-factor authentication on SGH Citrix servers contribute to the breach?,"The lack of mandatory 2-factor authentication for logging into SGH Citrix servers meant that the attacker could gain access using alternative means, bypassing the intended secure access methods. This, combined with the awareness and use of these alternative routes by administrators, facilitated the compromise."
What is the significance of RDP in the context of unauthorized access to SGH Citrix servers?,RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) was a potential vector for unauthorized access to SGH Citrix servers because firewalls were not in place to prevent its misuse. This allowed for remote connections that could be exploited if not properly secured.
Why were SGH Citrix servers considered less critical than the SCM database from a management perspective?,"SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. This led to them receiving less stringent security management, such as the absence of real-time monitoring and vulnerability scanning, which were applied to more critical systems."
How did the attacker utilize the internet connectivity of the SingHealth network?,"The attacker exploited the internet connectivity of the SingHealth network as an entry point. They used an internet-connected workstation to gain access to the network, which then enabled them to navigate towards the SCM database."
What was the proposed solution for internet access for staff requiring it?,"For staff who required internet access for their work, the proposed solution was to provide it through a secure internet access platform, which was planned to be a 'remote browser'. This was part of a strategy to mitigate risks associated with direct internet connectivity."
What does 'publicly available hacking tool' imply in the context of the Outlook vulnerability?,"The term 'publicly available hacking tool' implies that the tool used by the attacker was not a custom-made exploit but was accessible to a wider audience. This increases the risk, as it suggests that many attackers could potentially use it if vulnerabilities are not patched, as was the case with the unpatched Outlook versions."
What were the findings of CSA's forensic analysis regarding network infrastructure?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that pointed to the use of overseas C2 servers. These servers were instrumental in the attacker's operations within the network.
What is the purpose of 'beaconing' in C2 infrastructure?,"'Beaconing' is a function of C2 infrastructure where infected machines periodically communicate with the C2 server. This communication, often referred to as a 'heartbeat,' is used to maintain the connection and ensure the attacker retains control over the compromised system."
Summarize the security implications of the lack of DAM implementation.,"The lack of implementation of Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions meant that the SCM database was not monitored for unusual queries and access. This oversight created a blind spot, allowing malicious activities to go undetected."
What security measures were lacking on SGH Citrix servers regarding access control?,"SGH Citrix servers lacked robust access control because Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means of access, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. This allowed for easier unauthorized access."
What was the specific risk associated with RDP on SGH Citrix servers?,The specific risk associated with RDP on SGH Citrix servers was the potential for unauthorized remote access due to the absence of firewalls. This meant that attackers could potentially establish remote connections and control these servers without authorization.
How did the management approach to SGH Citrix servers differ from mission-critical systems?,"SGH Citrix servers were not treated as mission-critical, leading to less rigorous security practices. They were not monitored for real-time analysis or alerts, and vulnerability scanning, which was performed on mission-critical systems, was not conducted on them."
What was the initial point of entry for the attacker into the SingHealth network?,The initial point of entry for the attacker into the SingHealth network was an internet-connected workstation (Workstation A). This was facilitated by the network's overall internet connectivity.
What was the intended security improvement for internet access by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the intention was to improve internet security by removing access for staff who did not require it for work. For those who did, access was to be channeled through a secure platform, a 'remote browser'."
What is the significance of a patch being available for a vulnerability?,"The availability of a patch for a vulnerability signifies that a solution exists to fix the security flaw. In this case, the fact that a patch for the Outlook vulnerability was available since late 2017, but not applied, highlights a failure in the software upgrade policy and process."
What were the identified network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?,The identified network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were a number of overseas C2 servers. These servers were part of the attacker's infrastructure and indicated a sophisticated and potentially external threat.
Explain the function of C2 servers in malware deployment.,"C2 servers are used in malware deployment to 'drop' the malware onto the targeted system. This means the server acts as a distribution point for the malicious software, initiating the infection process."
What was the primary security concern regarding the SCM database?,The primary security concern regarding the SCM database was the lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access. This absence of oversight made it difficult to detect and respond to potential threats or unauthorized activities.
What made SGH Citrix servers vulnerable to unauthorized access?,SGH Citrix servers were vulnerable due to the absence of Privileged Access Management as the sole access method and the possibility of logging in without two-factor authentication. This allowed for easier exploitation by attackers.
What was the consequence of the lack of firewalls for RDP on SGH Citrix servers?,"The lack of firewalls for RDP on SGH Citrix servers meant that unauthorized remote access was possible. This created a significant security risk, as attackers could potentially connect to and control these servers without proper authorization or security checks."
