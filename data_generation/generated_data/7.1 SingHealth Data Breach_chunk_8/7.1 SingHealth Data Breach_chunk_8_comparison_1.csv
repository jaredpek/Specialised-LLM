What are the differences between Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) and traditional security measures?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are designed to address specific gaps in security, particularly concerning the monitoring of databases for unusual queries and access. Unlike traditional security measures that might offer broader network protection, DAM focuses on the granular activity within the database itself. The document highlights that DAM solutions could address some or all of the three gaps previously mentioned, and specifically notes that DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack, indicating a gap in their security posture that traditional measures may not have fully covered."
Explain the role of SGH Citrix servers in the cyber breach.,"The SGH Citrix servers played a critical role in the cyber breach by providing the attacker with access to the SCM database. These servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Specifically, Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing them, and logins were possible through other means without two-factor authentication. Furthermore, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this alternative, less secure route for convenience, which ultimately facilitated the attacker's access."
What security vulnerabilities were present in the SGH Citrix servers?,"The SGH Citrix servers suffered from several security vulnerabilities. Firstly, they were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, allowing logins through means other than Privileged Access Management and without two-factor authentication. Secondly, there was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). Lastly, the SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues, and vulnerability scanning, a process of inspecting potential security exploit points, was not performed on them, unlike mission-critical systems."
Define Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and its relevance to the SGH Citrix server security.,"Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft. It enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection. In the context of the SGH Citrix servers' security, the lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP was a significant vulnerability. This allowed for potential unauthorized entry and control of the servers via this protocol."
"How were the SGH Citrix servers managed, and what were the implications for security?","The SGH Citrix servers were managed with a lower priority, being treated as not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. This resulted in them not being monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. Additionally, vulnerability scanning, which is the inspection of potential security exploit points, was not conducted on these servers, even though it was performed on mission-critical systems. This lack of diligent management and monitoring left the SGH Citrix servers exposed to security risks."
How did internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network contribute to the attack surface?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet, while necessary for operational needs, significantly increased the attack surface. This internet connectivity created an avenue for both entry and exit for the attacker. The attacker was able to leverage an internet-connected workstation to gain initial entry into the network, subsequently moving towards the SCM database to steal medical data."
"What were the security risks associated with internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network, and what measures were considered?","The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were identified as early as August 2015. By June 2017, the healthcare sector determined that internet access should be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For those who did require internet access, it was to be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was planned to be a 'remote browser'."
Explain the vulnerability related to the versions of Outlook used by IHiS.,"The versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to install the hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a flaw in the installed Outlook application. A patch that could have prevented this exploitation and the tool's installation had been available since late-2017, highlighting a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
"What is a hacking tool in the context of the cyber breach, and how was it used?","In the context of the cyber breach, a hacking tool refers to a publicly available software that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities. The attacker was able to install such a tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation. This installation occurred on December 1, 2017, and was facilitated by the fact that the Outlook versions used by IHiS were not patched against this specific tool."
"What does 'patch' mean in the context of software security, and why was it important in this case?","In software security, a 'patch' is a piece of code designed to fix a vulnerability or bug in a software program. In this case, a patch was available since late-2017 that was effective in preventing the exploitation of the Outlook vulnerability and, consequently, the installation of the hacking tool. The fact that this patch was not applied to the Outlook versions used by IHiS meant that the vulnerability remained open for exploitation."
What is the significance of 'software upgrade policies' in relation to the cyber breach?,"The cyber breach highlighted a clear need to improve software upgrade policies. Specifically, the failure to patch the versions of Outlook used by IHiS against a publicly available hacking tool, despite a patch being available since late-2017, demonstrates a deficiency in their software upgrade processes. Effective software upgrade policies are crucial for ensuring that systems are protected against known vulnerabilities and exploits."
"What is C2 infrastructure, and what were its functions in the cyber breach?","C2 infrastructure, short for Command and Control infrastructure, refers to the systems used by attackers to remotely control compromised machines. CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These servers were generally used for three primary functions: Infection, where the server is used to drop malware into a system; Data exfiltration, where technical data is sent to the servers; and Beacon, where infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat' for sustained communication."
Define 'Indicators of Compromise' (IOCs) and their role in the cyber breach investigation.,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are pieces of forensic data, such as network traffic patterns or system logs, that indicate a potential intrusion or compromise of a system. In the context of the cyber breach, CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network IOCs that pointed towards the use of overseas C2 servers. These IOCs were crucial in identifying the nature and extent of the attacker's infrastructure and activities."
What is 'infection' in the context of C2 infrastructure?,"In the context of C2 infrastructure, 'infection' refers to the process where a compromised server is used as a means of delivering malware into a target system. This is one of the primary functions of C2 servers, allowing attackers to introduce malicious software that can then be controlled remotely."
What is 'data exfiltration' in the context of C2 infrastructure?,"Data exfiltration, in the context of C2 infrastructure, refers to the process of transferring data from a compromised system to the attacker's control. The forensic analysis indicated that there were signs of technical data being sent to the C2 servers, which is a clear indication of data exfiltration activities."
Explain the concept of 'beacon' in relation to C2 servers.,"A 'beacon' in the context of C2 servers refers to the communication established between infected machines and the C2 servers. It involves infected machines connecting to the C2 servers to maintain a 'heartbeat.' This heartbeat is a slow, rhythmic communication pattern that is primarily used to sustain the communication channel, ensuring that the attacker can maintain control over the compromised systems."
Compare the monitoring of SCM databases with the monitoring of SGH Citrix servers.,"The SCM database was treated as mission-critical, implying a higher level of monitoring and security. In contrast, the SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical. This difference in classification led to a disparity in monitoring practices. The SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues, nor were they subjected to vulnerability scanning, unlike the SCM database which likely received more robust security oversight."
What was the critical role of SGH Citrix servers in granting the attacker access?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with the necessary access to the SCM database. This access was facilitated by security weaknesses in the Citrix servers, including the availability of alternative login methods without two-factor authentication and the awareness and utilization of these methods by administrators for convenience."
What is Privileged Access Management (PAM) and how was its implementation related to the SGH Citrix server breach?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) refers to systems and processes designed to control and monitor access for users with elevated permissions. In the case of the SGH Citrix servers, PAM was not the exclusive means of access. This meant that other, less secure methods were available for logging into the servers, and these methods, crucially, did not require two-factor authentication, thereby creating a significant security loophole."
How did the IHiS Citrix administrators' actions contribute to the security breach?,"The IHiS Citrix administrators' actions contributed to the security breach by being aware of and utilizing an alternative, less secure route for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. This alternative route bypassed standard security protocols, such as two-factor authentication, and was used for convenience. By exploiting this known vulnerability, they inadvertently facilitated the attacker's access to critical systems."
What is the definition of 'unauthorized access' in the context of the SGH Citrix servers?,"Unauthorized access, in the context of the SGH Citrix servers, refers to gaining entry to these servers through means that bypass established security controls. This included logging in through methods other than the designated Privileged Access Management system and, critically, without the required two-factor authentication, which was a known possibility and was utilized by administrators."
What is the significance of 'two-factor authentication' in preventing unauthorized access to SGH Citrix servers?,"Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. In the context of the SGH Citrix servers, the fact that logins were possible without 2FA meant that a significant security layer was missing. If 2FA had been enforced for all access methods, it would have been much harder for unauthorized individuals, including the attacker, to gain access even if they bypassed other controls."
What is the definition of 'firewalls' and their role in preventing unauthorized remote access?,"Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Their role is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. In the context of the SGH Citrix servers, a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP meant that there was no effective barrier to stop malicious actors from attempting to connect to and control the servers remotely."
What is the definition of 'vulnerability scanning' and why was it not performed on SGH Citrix servers?,"Vulnerability scanning is a security process that involves inspecting a computer or network for potential points of exploit, thereby identifying gaps in security. This process was carried out for mission-critical systems within the organization. However, it was not carried out for the SGH Citrix servers, which were treated as less critical. This omission meant that potential security weaknesses on these servers went undetected."
Compare the criticality of SCM database and SGH Citrix servers.,"The SCM database was treated as a mission-critical system, indicating its high importance and the need for robust security measures. In contrast, the SGH Citrix servers were treated as not mission-critical. This difference in perceived criticality led to different levels of security oversight, with the Citrix servers receiving less attention regarding monitoring and vulnerability assessment, which ultimately proved to be a significant security lapse."
How did the SingHealth network's internet connection create an 'attack surface'?,"The SingHealth network's connection to the Internet created an 'attack surface' by providing an avenue for both entry and exit for potential attackers. While this connectivity served operational needs, it also exposed the network to external threats. The attacker was able to exploit this by using an internet-connected workstation to gain initial access to the network, which was a stepping stone to reaching the SCM database."
What is 'Workstation A' and its role in the cyber breach?,"Workstation A was an internet-connected workstation within the SingHealth network. It played a crucial role in the cyber breach as it was the initial point of entry for the attacker into the network. By compromising this workstation, the attacker was able to gain a foothold and subsequently navigate towards the SCM database to steal medical data."
What is the definition of 'attack surface' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, the 'attack surface' refers to the sum of all the points (the 'surface') at which an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. It encompasses all potential vulnerabilities and entry points that an attacker could exploit. The SingHealth network's internet connectivity increased this attack surface, making it more susceptible to breaches."
What actions were planned by June 2017 regarding internet access for staff?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access should be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For staff who did need internet access for their duties, it was decided that access would be provided through a secure internet access platform, which was intended to be a 'remote browser' at that time."
What were the security risks identified by CSA to MOH regarding internet connectivity?,The security risks arising from internet connectivity in the SingHealth network were raised by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) to the Ministry of Health (MOH) as early as August 2015. These risks pertained to the increased attack surface and potential vulnerabilities that internet access could introduce into the network.
What is a 'remote browser' in the context of secure internet access?,"A 'remote browser' is a type of secure internet access platform. In the context of the SingHealth IT network, it was planned to be the method through which staff requiring internet access for work would connect. This approach aims to isolate internet browsing activities from the internal network, thereby reducing the risk of malware infection or exploitation."
What vulnerability allowed the attacker to install a hacking tool on Workstation A?,"The attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation. This occurred on December 1, 2017. The fact that the Outlook versions used by IHiS were not patched against this specific tool was the key enabler for this installation."
When was the patch available that could have prevented the Outlook vulnerability exploitation?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the exploitation of the Outlook vulnerability, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017. The failure to apply this patch to the Outlook versions used by IHiS meant that the system remained vulnerable to the attack."
What is the definition of 'hacking tool' as used in the document?,"A 'hacking tool,' as used in the document, refers to a publicly available software that can be utilized to exploit vulnerabilities within a system. The attacker was able to install such a tool on Workstation A by leveraging a flaw in the Outlook application."
What is the implication of 'publicly available' for a hacking tool?,"The fact that the hacking tool was 'publicly available' implies that it was not a custom-developed tool but rather something accessible to a wider audience. This increases the risk, as it suggests that many potential attackers could have access to and knowledge of how to use such tools to exploit common software vulnerabilities."
What is the definition of 'exploit' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, an 'exploit' is a piece of software, data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (like blockchain). In this case, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Outlook application to install the hacking tool."
What is the relationship between patching software and preventing exploitation?,"Patching software is a critical process for preventing exploitation. A patch is designed to fix vulnerabilities that attackers could otherwise exploit. By applying patches, organizations ensure that known weaknesses are addressed, thereby closing off potential entry points for malicious actors and preventing them from installing harmful tools or gaining unauthorized access."
What is the definition of 'network Indicators of Compromise' (IOCs)?,"Network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are observable artifacts or data points found on a network that suggest a security breach or compromise may have occurred. These can include unusual network traffic patterns, suspicious IP addresses, or specific types of data flows. CSA's forensic analysis identified such network IOCs that pointed towards the use of overseas C2 servers."
What does 'overseas C2 servers' imply in the context of the cyber breach?,"The identification of 'overseas C2 servers' implies that the command and control infrastructure used by the attackers was located outside of the immediate jurisdiction or network being targeted. This can complicate investigations and attribution, as it involves cross-border legal and technical challenges."
What is the general purpose of C2 servers?,"C2 servers, or Command and Control servers, are generally used by attackers to remotely manage and direct compromised systems. They act as a central hub for issuing commands, receiving data, and maintaining communication with the infected machines, enabling the attacker to orchestrate their malicious activities."
What is the definition of 'malware'?,"Malware is short for malicious software. It is a type of software designed to intentionally cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. In the context of C2 infrastructure, malware is often delivered via the 'infection' process, allowing attackers to gain control over the compromised system."
What is the definition of 'heartbeat' in network communication?,"In network communication, a 'heartbeat' refers to a periodic signal sent by a device or application to indicate that it is still active and functioning. In the context of C2 servers, infected machines establish a 'heartbeat' with the C2 server. This is a slow, rhythmic communication meant solely to sustain the communication channel, ensuring the attacker's continued control over the compromised system."
Compare the security monitoring of SCM database versus SGH Citrix servers.,"The SCM database was treated as mission-critical, suggesting it received a higher level of security scrutiny. In contrast, the SGH Citrix servers were considered not mission-critical. This difference in classification meant that the SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities, nor were they subjected to vulnerability scanning, unlike the SCM database."
What was the primary function of the SGH Citrix servers in the attack chain?,"The primary function of the SGH Citrix servers in the attack chain was to serve as a critical gateway. Their compromise provided the attacker with the necessary access to reach the SCM database, which was the ultimate target for stealing medical data. The security weaknesses in these servers were instrumental in enabling this crucial step for the attacker."
What security measure was not exclusively used for accessing SGH Citrix servers?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. This allowed for alternative login methods to be available, which, critically, did not require two-factor authentication, thereby creating a significant security vulnerability."
How did the availability of alternative login methods for SGH Citrix servers impact security?,"The availability of alternative login methods for SGH Citrix servers, which did not require two-factor authentication, significantly impacted security by creating a loophole. Even if Privileged Access Management was in place, these alternative routes allowed for unauthorized access, as demonstrated by the attacker's ability to compromise the servers and subsequently gain access to the SCM database."
What is the definition of 'unauthorized remote access' in the context of RDP?,"Unauthorized remote access using RDP refers to gaining control of a computer or server from a remote location via the Remote Desktop Protocol without proper authorization. The lack of firewalls to prevent such access to the SGH Citrix servers meant that this vector of attack was left open, allowing potential malicious remote connections."
What is the definition of 'mission-critical' in system management?,"In system management, 'mission-critical' refers to systems that are essential for the core operations and functioning of an organization. Their failure or compromise would have severe consequences. The SCM database was treated as mission-critical, while the SGH Citrix servers were not, leading to different levels of security prioritization."
How did internet connectivity increase the 'attack surface' of the SingHealth IT network?,"Internet connectivity increased the 'attack surface' of the SingHealth IT network by providing an external pathway for attackers to enter the network. This connection, while serving operational needs, also created vulnerabilities that the attacker could exploit, such as using an internet-connected workstation as an initial point of entry to gain access to the broader network and subsequently the SCM database."
What was the consequence of not patching Outlook versions used by IHiS?,"The consequence of not patching the Outlook versions used by IHiS was that they remained vulnerable to a publicly available hacking tool. This allowed the attacker to exploit the vulnerability and install the hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, which was a critical step in their intrusion."
What is the definition of 'C2 servers'?,"C2 servers, short for Command and Control servers, are a type of infrastructure used by attackers to remotely manage and direct compromised computer systems. They facilitate communication between the attacker and the infected machines, enabling the execution of commands, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities."
