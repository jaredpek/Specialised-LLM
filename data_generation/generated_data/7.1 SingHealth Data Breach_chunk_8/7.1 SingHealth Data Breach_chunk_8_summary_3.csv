Provide a comprehensive summary of the lack of monitoring at the SCM database.,"The SCM database lacked adequate monitoring for unusual queries and access. Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions are available on the market that could address these gaps. However, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
Summarize the security vulnerabilities related to SGH Citrix servers.,"SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in granting the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing these servers, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and used it for convenience."
Explain the lack of firewalls for remote access to SGH Citrix servers.,"There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access to the SGH Citrix servers using RDP. RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol, which is a proprietary network communication protocol developed by Microsoft. It enables a user to connect to and control another computer remotely over a network connection."
Describe the observations regarding the overall management of SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not treated as mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. They were not monitored for real-time analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues. Vulnerability scanning, which was performed for mission-critical systems, was not conducted for the SGH Citrix servers. Vulnerability scanning is an inspection of potential points of exploit on a computer to identify security gaps."
Summarize how internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network increased the attack surface.,"The SingHealth network's connection to the internet, while serving operational needs, created an entry and exit avenue for attackers. This allowed an attacker to use an internet-connected workstation to gain network entry and subsequently access the SCM database to steal medical data. Security risks associated with this internet connectivity were raised by CSA to MOH as early as August 2015. By June 2017, the healthcare sector determined that internet access would be removed for staff not requiring it for work, and for those who did, access would be through a secure platform like a 'remote browser'."
Explain the issue with unpatched versions of Outlook used by IHiS.,"Versions of Outlook used by IHiS were not patched against a publicly available hacking tool. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Outlook application on Workstation A to install this hacking tool on December 1, 2017. A patch that could have prevented this vulnerability and tool installation was available since late-2017, indicating a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
Provide a summary of the extensive C2 infrastructure identified.,"CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. C2 servers are Command and Control servers. These servers were generally used for three purposes: Infection, where malware is dropped into a system; Data exfiltration, where technical data is sent to the servers; and Beacon, where infected machines establish a 'heartbeat' with C2 servers for sustained communication."
What were the key issues with the SCM database monitoring?,"The SCM database suffered from a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access. While Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions exist to address such gaps, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
Describe the security shortcomings of the SGH Citrix servers.,"SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Their compromise was crucial for the attacker to reach the SCM database. Access to these servers was not exclusively managed by Privileged Access Management, and logins without two-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this less secure alternative route for convenience."
What was the role of RDP in the SGH Citrix server security issues?,"There was a lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access to SGH Citrix servers via RDP. RDP, or Remote Desktop Protocol, is a Microsoft-developed protocol that allows remote connection and control of another computer. The absence of firewalls for RDP facilitated unauthorized remote access."
"How were the SGH Citrix servers managed, and what were the implications?","The SGH Citrix servers were managed as if they were not mission-critical, unlike the SCM database. Consequently, they were not monitored for real-time analysis or alerts regarding vulnerabilities and issues. Furthermore, vulnerability scanning, a process of inspecting potential security exploit points, was not performed on these servers, despite being conducted for mission-critical systems."
Explain how internet connectivity in the SingHealth IT network created vulnerabilities.,"The SingHealth IT network's connection to the internet, while necessary for operations, provided an avenue for attackers to enter and exit the network. This connectivity allowed an attacker to use an internet-connected workstation as an initial point of access, from which they could proceed to the SCM database and steal medical data. The security risks associated with this internet connectivity were flagged as early as August 2015."
What measures were considered for internet access in the healthcare sector by June 2017?,"By June 2017, the healthcare sector had determined that internet access should be removed for staff who did not require it for their work. For staff who did need internet access, it was to be provided through a secure internet access platform, which at that time was planned to be a 'remote browser'."
Detail the vulnerability related to Outlook versions and patching.,"IHiS used versions of Outlook that were not patched against a known, publicly available hacking tool. This allowed an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the Outlook application on Workstation A and install the hacking tool on December 1, 2017. A patch that would have prevented this exploitation was available since late-2017, highlighting a deficiency in software upgrade policies."
What is the significance of C2 infrastructure in the context of the breach?,"The breach involved extensive C2 (Command and Control) infrastructure, identified through network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These servers were used for critical attack functions: Infection (deploying malware), Data exfiltration (transferring stolen data), and Beacon (maintaining communication with compromised machines)."
Summarize the security gaps related to the SCM database.,"The primary security gap concerning the SCM database was the lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access. Although solutions like Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) exist, they were not implemented by IHiS at the time of the incident."
What were the specific security weaknesses of the SGH Citrix servers?,"SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured. They allowed logins without two-factor authentication, and Privileged Access Management was not the sole access control. This enabled unauthorized access, which was critical for the attacker to reach the SCM database. IHiS administrators were aware of and exploited these weaknesses for convenience."
Explain the role of firewalls and RDP in the security breach.,"The absence of firewalls to prevent unauthorized remote access using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) to the SGH Citrix servers was a significant security flaw. RDP allows remote control of computers, and without firewall protection, it provided an easy entry point for attackers."
How did the management approach to SGH Citrix servers contribute to the breach?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not prioritized as mission-critical systems, leading to inadequate security measures. They were not monitored in real-time for vulnerabilities or issues, and vulnerability scanning was not performed on them. This lack of attention allowed security gaps to persist, which were exploited by the attacker."
