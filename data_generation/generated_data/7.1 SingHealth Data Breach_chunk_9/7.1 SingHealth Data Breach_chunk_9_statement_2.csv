What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding C2 servers?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which appeared to be overseas C2 servers.
What does 'IOCs' stand for in the context of cybersecurity?,"IOCs stands for Indicators of Compromise, which are artifacts observed on a network or operating system that, with high confidence, indicate a computer intrusion."
What are the general uses of C2 servers as explained by CSA?,"Generally, C2 servers were used for infection, where the server is used as a means of dropping malware into the system it is trying to infect; data exfiltration, where there were indications of technical data being sent to the servers; and beaconing, where infected machines may have connected to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'."
Define 'infection' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Infection, in the context of C2 server usage, refers to the process where the server is used as a means of dropping malware into the system it is trying to infect."
Explain 'data exfiltration' as a function of C2 servers.,"Data exfiltration, as a function of C2 servers, involves indications of technical data being sent from infected systems to the servers."
What is meant by 'beacon' in relation to C2 servers and infected machines?,"Beaconing, in relation to C2 servers and infected machines, refers to infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A 'heartbeat' is a slow, rhythmic communication meant just to sustain communications."
