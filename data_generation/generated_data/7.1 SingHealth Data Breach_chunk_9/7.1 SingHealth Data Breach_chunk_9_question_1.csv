What is the significance of the unpatched versions of Outlook used by IHiS?,"The unpatched versions of Outlook used by IHiS were significant because they allowed an attacker to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This was possible by exploiting a vulnerability present in the specific version of Outlook installed on the workstation. A patch to prevent this vulnerability was available since late 2017, highlighting a need to improve software upgrade policies."
How did the attacker gain access to Workstation A?,"The attacker gained access to Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on that workstation. This allowed them to install a publicly available hacking tool."
When was a patch available to prevent the Outlook vulnerability from being exploited?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017."
What is the implication of the unpatched Outlook versions for IHiS's policies?,"The incident involving unpatched Outlook versions indicates a clear need for IHiS to improve its software upgrade policies. This suggests that the current processes for updating software and patching vulnerabilities were insufficient, leading to a security breach."
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal about C2 infrastructure?,"CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas Command and Control (C2) servers. These C2 servers were generally used for infection, data exfiltration, and beaconing."
What are the general uses of C2 servers as identified by CSA?,"As identified by CSA, C2 servers were generally used for three main purposes: 
1. Infection: The server is used as a means of dropping malware into the system it is trying to infect.
2. Data exfiltration: Indications were found of technical data being sent to the servers.
3. Beacon: Infected machines may have connected to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat', which is a slow, rhythmic communication used to sustain communications."
Define 'infection' in the context of C2 server usage.,"In the context of C2 server usage, 'infection' refers to the process where the server is used as a means of dropping malware into a system that it is attempting to infect."
What is 'data exfiltration' in relation to C2 servers?,"Data exfiltration, in relation to C2 servers, refers to the act of sending technical data from an infected system to these servers. Indications of this activity were observed during forensic analysis."
Explain the concept of 'beacon' in the context of C2 servers.,"In the context of C2 servers, 'beacon' refers to the communication established by infected machines with these servers. It is characterized by a slow, rhythmic pattern, often called a 'heartbeat', which is primarily used to sustain the communication link."
What is a 'heartbeat' in the context of C2 server communications?,"A 'heartbeat' in the context of C2 server communications is a slow, rhythmic communication pattern established by infected machines with C2 servers. Its purpose is to sustain the ongoing communication link between the compromised system and the command and control infrastructure."
