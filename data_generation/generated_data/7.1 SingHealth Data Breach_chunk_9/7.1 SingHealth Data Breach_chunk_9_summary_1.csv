Summarize the incident involving IHiS and the unpatched Outlook versions.,"An attacker successfully installed a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This was possible due to a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on the workstation. A patch to prevent this vulnerability was available since late 2017, highlighting a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
Explain the role of C2 infrastructure in the cyber breach.,"The Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, identified through network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) appearing to be overseas servers, was used for several purposes. These included: Infection, where the server facilitated the dropping of malware into systems; Data exfiltration, indicated by technical data being sent to the servers; and Beaconing, where infected machines connected to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat', a slow, rhythmic communication to sustain connectivity."
What actions did the COI Committee take regarding the cyber breach?,"The Committee made a total of 16 recommendations, with 7 of them designated as priority ones to be implemented immediately."
Summarize Recommendation #1 for enhancing security structure and readiness.,"Recommendation #1 emphasizes that cybersecurity should be treated as a risk management issue, not just a technical one. Decisions regarding security should be made at the appropriate management level, balancing security, operational requirements, and cost. IHiS is also advised to adopt a 'defence-in-depth' approach and address the gaps between policy and practice."
Detail Recommendation #2 concerning the cyber stack.,"Recommendation #2 calls for a review of the cyber stack to ensure its adequacy in defending against and responding to advanced threats. This involves identifying gaps by mapping IT stack layers against existing security technologies. It also requires filling response technology gaps by acquiring endpoint and network forensics capabilities, reviewing current endpoint security measures, enhancing network security to disrupt the 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain, and heightening application security for email."
Explain Recommendation #3 on improving staff awareness of cybersecurity.,"Recommendation #3 focuses on improving staff awareness of cybersecurity to enhance the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents. This includes improving cyber hygiene among users, implementing a Security Awareness Programme to reduce organizational risk, and ensuring IT staff possess sufficient knowledge to recognize security incident signs in a real-world context."
What are the key points of Recommendation #4 regarding enhanced security checks?,"Recommendation #4 mandates enhanced security checks, particularly on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems. This includes regularly conducting vulnerability assessments, performing safety reviews, evaluations, and certifications of vendor products where feasible, regularly conducting penetration testing, periodically carrying out red teaming exercises, and considering threat hunting."
Describe Recommendation #5 for managing privileged administrator accounts.,"Recommendation #5 requires privileged administrator accounts to be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring. This involves creating an inventory of administrative accounts for rationalization, mandating two-factor authentication for all administrators performing administrative tasks, considering the use of passphrases instead of passwords to reduce compromise risk, implementing and enforcing password policies across domain and local accounts, centrally managing server local administrator accounts across the IT network, and managing and controlling service accounts with high privileges."
