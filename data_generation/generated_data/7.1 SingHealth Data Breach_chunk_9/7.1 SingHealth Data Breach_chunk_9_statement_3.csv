When was the patch available to prevent the Outlook vulnerability from being exploited?,"A patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited, and thus preventing the installation of the hacking tool, was available since late-2017."
What was the implication of the unpatched Outlook versions used by IHiS?,The implication of the unpatched Outlook versions used by IHiS was that they were vulnerable to a publicly available hacking tool. This allowed an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in the Outlook application on Workstation A to install the hacking tool.
What did CSA's forensic analysis reveal regarding C2 infrastructure?,"CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which appeared to be overseas C2 servers. These C2 servers were generally used for infection, data exfiltration, and beaconing."
Define 'Infection' in the context of C2 servers.,"Infection, in the context of C2 servers, refers to the use of the server as a means of dropping malware into a system that it is trying to infect."
Define 'Data exfiltration' in the context of C2 servers.,"Data exfiltration, in the context of C2 servers, refers to indications of technical data being sent to the servers."
Define 'Beacon' in the context of C2 servers.,"Beacon, in the context of C2 servers, refers to infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A 'heartbeat' is a slow, rhythmic communication meant just to sustain communications."
What were the C2 servers generally used for?,"The C2 servers were generally used for three main purposes: infection (dropping malware into systems), data exfiltration (sending technical data to the servers), and beaconing (infected machines establishing a 'heartbeat' with the servers to sustain communications)."

Explain the concept of a 'heartbeat' in the context of C2 servers.,"A 'heartbeat' in the context of C2 servers refers to a slow, rhythmic communication established by infected machines connecting to C2 servers. This communication is meant solely to sustain the connection between the infected machine and the C2 server."
What is the purpose of a 'defence-in-depth' approach as mentioned in Recommendation #1?,"The 'defence-in-depth' approach, as mentioned in Recommendation #1, is a strategy that IHiS must adopt. While the document does not explicitly define it, it is presented as a method to enhance security structure and readiness, implying multiple layers of security measures."
What are the 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases are stages within the Cyber Kill Chain. The document states that network security must be enhanced to disrupt these phases, implying they are critical points in an attack lifecycle where an attacker communicates with compromised systems and carries out their ultimate goals."
What is the significance of 'Indicators of Compromise' (IOCs) in cybersecurity?,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are network artifacts or evidence that suggest a system or network has been compromised. In the context of the document, CSA's forensic analysis revealed IOCs that pointed to overseas C2 servers, helping to identify the infrastructure used in the breach."
What is the role of 'penetration testing' in cybersecurity?,"Penetration testing is a cybersecurity practice that involves simulating cyberattacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities. Recommendation #4 states that penetration testing must be conducted regularly, indicating its importance in proactively finding and addressing security weaknesses."
What is 'threat hunting' in the context of cybersecurity?,"'Threat hunting' is a proactive cybersecurity measure where security professionals actively search for threats that may have evaded existing security defenses. Recommendation #4 suggests that threat hunting must be considered, highlighting its value in uncovering hidden or advanced threats."
What is 'red teaming' in cybersecurity?,"'Red teaming' is a cybersecurity exercise where a team simulates an adversary's actions to test an organization's defenses. Recommendation #4 suggests that red teaming should be carried out periodically, indicating its role in evaluating the effectiveness of security measures against realistic attack scenarios."
What is the purpose of 'vulnerability assessments'?,"Vulnerability assessments are systematic evaluations of security weaknesses in an information system. Recommendation #4 emphasizes that vulnerability assessments must be conducted regularly, underscoring their importance in identifying and rectifying potential security flaws before they can be exploited."
What is the importance of 'two-factor authentication' for administrators?,"Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. Recommendation #5 mandates that all administrators must use two-factor authentication when performing administrative tasks, significantly enhancing the security of privileged accounts by adding an extra layer of verification."
What are 'service accounts with high privileges'?,"'Service accounts with high privileges' are accounts used by applications or services that have elevated permissions to perform critical operations on a system or network. Recommendation #5 stresses that these accounts must be managed and controlled, recognizing their potential as a high-risk target if compromised."
What is the goal of 'rationalisation of administrative accounts'?,"The goal of 'rationalisation of administrative accounts' is to streamline and optimize the management of accounts that have administrative privileges. Recommendation #5 suggests creating an inventory of administrative accounts to facilitate this rationalization, implying a need to ensure that only necessary accounts exist and are properly managed."
What is the implication of 'gaps between policy and practice' in cybersecurity?,"The implication of 'gaps between policy and practice' in cybersecurity is that there is a disconnect between the established security rules and guidelines (policy) and how they are actually implemented and followed in day-to-day operations (practice). Recommendation #1 highlights that these gaps must be addressed, indicating that they represent a weakness that can be exploited."
What does it mean for cybersecurity to be viewed as a 'risk management issue'?,"Viewing cybersecurity as a 'risk management issue' means that decisions regarding security should be made by considering the potential risks and their impact on the organization, rather than solely focusing on technical aspects. This involves balancing security needs with operational requirements and costs, as stated in Recommendation #1."
