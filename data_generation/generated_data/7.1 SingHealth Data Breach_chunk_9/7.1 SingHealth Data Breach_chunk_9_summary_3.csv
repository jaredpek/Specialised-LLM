Summarize the incident involving IHiS and the unpatched Outlook versions.,"An attacker successfully installed a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This was possible due to a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on the workstation. A patch to prevent this vulnerability was available since late 2017, highlighting a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
Explain the role of C2 infrastructure in the cyber breach.,"The Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, identified through network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) appearing to be overseas servers, was used for several purposes. These included: Infection, where the server was used to drop malware into systems; Data exfiltration, where technical data was sent to the servers; and Beaconing, where infected machines connected to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat', a slow, rhythmic communication to sustain connectivity."
What actions did the COI Committee take regarding the cyber breach?,"The Committee made 16 recommendations, with 7 of them designated as priority ones to be implemented immediately. These recommendations aim to address the vulnerabilities and improve the cybersecurity posture."
Summarize Recommendation #1 for IHiS and Public Health Institutions.,"Recommendation #1 emphasizes that cybersecurity should be treated as a risk management issue, not just a technical one. Decisions regarding security should be made at the appropriate management level, balancing security, operational needs, and cost. IHiS is advised to adopt a 'defence-in-depth' approach, which involves multiple layers of security, and to address any gaps between established policies and their practical implementation."
Detail Recommendation #2 concerning the cyber stack.,"Recommendation #2 calls for a review of the cyber stack to ensure its adequacy in defending against and responding to advanced threats. This involves identifying gaps by mapping IT stack layers against existing security technologies. It also requires filling gaps in response technologies by acquiring endpoint and network forensics capabilities, reviewing current endpoint security measures to address exploited gaps, enhancing network security to disrupt 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain, and increasing application security for email."
What is Recommendation #3 regarding staff awareness on cybersecurity?,"Recommendation #3 focuses on improving staff awareness of cybersecurity to enhance the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents. This includes improving cyber hygiene among users, implementing a Security Awareness Programme to reduce organizational risk, and ensuring IT staff possess sufficient knowledge to recognize security incident signs in real-world contexts."
Explain Recommendation #4 on enhanced security checks.,"Recommendation #4 mandates enhanced security checks, particularly on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems. This involves conducting regular vulnerability assessments, performing safety reviews, evaluations, and certifications of vendor products where feasible, conducting regular penetration testing, carrying out periodic red teaming exercises, and considering threat hunting."
Describe Recommendation #5 for privileged administrator accounts.,"Recommendation #5 requires privileged administrator accounts to be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring. This includes creating an inventory of administrative accounts for rationalization, ensuring all administrators use two-factor authentication for administrative tasks, considering the use of passphrases instead of passwords to reduce compromise risk, implementing and enforcing password policies across domain and local accounts, centrally managing server local administrator accounts across the IT network, and managing and controlling service accounts with high privileges."
What vulnerability allowed the hacking tool to be installed?,The hacking tool was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application that was installed on Workstation A.
When was the hacking tool installed on Workstation A?,"The hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017."
Was a patch available to prevent the vulnerability exploitation?,"Yes, a patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited was available since late-2017."
What was the implication of the unpatched Outlook versions?,The unpatched Outlook versions allowed an attacker to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability.
What is the definition of 'Indicators of Compromise' (IOCs)?,Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are network artifacts or data points that indicate a potential security breach or malicious activity within a system or network.
What type of C2 servers were identified by CSA's forensic analysis?,CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which appeared to be overseas C2 servers.
Define 'Infection' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Infection, in the context of C2 server usage, refers to the process where the server is used as a means of dropping malware into the system it is trying to infect."
Define 'Data exfiltration' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Data exfiltration, in the context of C2 server usage, refers to the act of indications of technical data being sent to the servers, implying unauthorized transfer of information."
Define 'Beacon' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Beacon, in the context of C2 server usage, refers to infected machines connecting to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. A heartbeat is a slow, rhythmic communication meant just to sustain communications, often used to maintain a persistent connection."
How many recommendations did the COI Committee make?,The Committee made 16 recommendations.
How many of the COI Committee's recommendations were priority ones?,Seven of the Committee's recommendations were priority ones.
What is the core principle of Recommendation #1 regarding cybersecurity?,"The core principle of Recommendation #1 is that cybersecurity must be viewed as a risk management issue, not merely a technical issue, and decisions should be deliberated at the appropriate management level to balance security, operational requirements, and cost."
What approach should IHiS adopt according to Recommendation #1?,"According to Recommendation #1, IHiS must adopt a 'defence-in-depth' approach."
What needs to be addressed according to Recommendation #1?,"According to Recommendation #1, gaps between policy and practice must be addressed."
What is the objective of Recommendation #2?,The objective of Recommendation #2 is to review the cyber stack to assess if it is adequate to defend and respond to advanced threats.
How can gaps in the cyber stack be identified according to Recommendation #2?,Gaps in the cyber stack can be identified by mapping layers of the IT stack against existing security technologies.
What capabilities need to be acquired to fill gaps in response technologies as per Recommendation #2?,Gaps in response technologies must be filled by acquiring endpoint and network forensics capabilities.
"What phases of the Cyber Kill Chain should network security be enhanced to disrupt, according to Recommendation #2?",Network security must be enhanced to disrupt the 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.
What specific application security needs to be heightened according to Recommendation #2?,Application security for email must be heightened.
What is the primary goal of Recommendation #3?,"The primary goal of Recommendation #3 is to improve staff awareness on cybersecurity to enhance the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents."
"What should be implemented to reduce organizational risk, as stated in Recommendation #3?",A Security Awareness Programme should be implemented to reduce organizational risk.
