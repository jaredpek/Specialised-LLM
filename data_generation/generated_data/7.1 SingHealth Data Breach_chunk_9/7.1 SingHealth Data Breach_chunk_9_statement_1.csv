What was the primary vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth Cyber Breach?,"The primary vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth Cyber Breach was a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on Workstation A. This allowed the attacker to install a publicly available hacking tool on the workstation on December 1, 2017."
When was the hacking tool installed on Workstation A?,"The hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017."
Was there a patch available to prevent the vulnerability exploited in the SingHealth Cyber Breach?,"Yes, a patch that was effective in preventing the vulnerability from being exploited was available since late-2017. This patch would have prevented the installation of the hacking tool."
What was the consequence of the unpatched Outlook version?,The consequence of the unpatched Outlook version was that an attacker was able to install a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A.
"What is the significance of the date December 1, 2017, in the SingHealth Cyber Breach?","December 1, 2017, is the date when the attacker was able to install the hacking tool on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the Outlook application."
What does 'C2 servers' refer to in the context of the cyber infrastructure?,"C2 servers, or Command and Control servers, are servers used by attackers to manage and control compromised systems. In the context of the SingHealth Cyber Breach, CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appeared to be overseas C2 servers."
What are the general uses of C2 servers as explained by CSA?,"Generally, C2 servers were used for three main purposes: Infection, where the server is used to drop malware into a system; Data exfiltration, where technical data is sent to the servers; and Beacon, where infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat' for sustained communication."
Define 'Infection' in the context of C2 server usage.,"Infection, in the context of C2 server usage, refers to the process where the server is utilized as a means of dropping malware into a system that the attacker is trying to infect."
Explain 'Data exfiltration' as a function of C2 servers.,"Data exfiltration, as a function of C2 servers, involves the indication of technical data being sent from compromised systems to these servers."
What is a 'heartbeat' in relation to C2 servers and infected machines?,"A 'heartbeat' in relation to C2 servers and infected machines refers to a slow, rhythmic communication established between infected machines and C2 servers. This communication is meant to sustain the connection and indicate that the compromised machine is still under the attacker's control."

What is Recommendation #5 concerning?,"Recommendation #5 is concerning privileged administrator accounts, stating they must be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring."

What is the purpose of a 'heartbeat' communication from infected machines to C2 servers?,"The purpose of a 'heartbeat' communication from infected machines to C2 servers is to establish a slow, rhythmic communication that sustains the connection and indicates the machine is still under the attacker's control."
Explain the concept of 'defence-in-depth' as mentioned in Recommendation #1.,"The 'defence-in-depth' approach, as mentioned in Recommendation #1, implies implementing multiple layers of security controls to protect systems and data. This approach aims to ensure that if one security measure fails, others are in place to prevent or mitigate a breach."
What are the 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain refers to the attacker establishing communication with compromised systems to issue commands. The 'Actions on Objective' phase is when the attacker carries out their ultimate goal, such as data theft or system disruption. Recommendation #2 suggests enhancing network security to disrupt these phases."
"What is the role of 'red teaming' in cybersecurity, as mentioned in Recommendation #4?","'Red teaming', as mentioned in Recommendation #4, is a periodic security exercise where a team simulates an attack on an organization's systems and defenses to identify vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of security measures."
What is 'threat hunting' in the context of cybersecurity?,'Threat hunting' is a proactive cybersecurity practice where security professionals actively search for and identify threats that may have evaded existing security defenses. It is considered in Recommendation #4.
"Why is it important to manage and control service accounts with high privileges, according to Recommendation #5?","It is important to manage and control service accounts with high privileges, as per Recommendation #5, because these accounts often have extensive access to systems and data, making them attractive targets for attackers. Tighter control reduces the risk of misuse or compromise."
"What is the implication of 'gaps between policy and practice' that need to be addressed, as per Recommendation #1?","The implication of 'gaps between policy and practice' that need to be addressed, as per Recommendation #1, is that there might be a discrepancy between the documented security policies and the actual implementation of those policies. This can lead to vulnerabilities and ineffective security."
"What is the purpose of 'safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products' in Recommendation #4?","The purpose of 'safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products' in Recommendation #4 is to ensure that third-party products and services used by the organization meet required security standards and do not introduce new vulnerabilities."
"How does 'two-factor authentication' enhance security for administrative tasks, as per Recommendation #5?","'Two-factor authentication' (2FA) enhances security for administrative tasks, as per Recommendation #5, by requiring users to provide two different forms of verification before granting access. This makes it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if one factor (like a password) is compromised."
What is the benefit of using 'passphrases instead of passwords' as suggested in Recommendation #5?,"The benefit of using 'passphrases instead of passwords', as suggested in Recommendation #5, is that passphrases are typically longer and more complex than passwords, making them harder to guess or crack through brute-force attacks, thereby reducing the risk of accounts being compromised."
