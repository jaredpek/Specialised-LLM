Summarize the incident involving IHiS and the unpatched Outlook versions.,"An attacker successfully installed a publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This was possible due to a vulnerability in the version of the Outlook application installed on the workstation. A patch to prevent this vulnerability was available since late 2017, highlighting a clear need to improve software upgrade policies."
Explain the role of C2 infrastructure in the cyber breach.,"The Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, identified through network Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) appearing to be overseas servers, was utilized for several purposes. These included 'Infection', where the server was used to deploy malware; 'Data exfiltration', indicated by technical data being sent to the servers; and 'Beacon', where infected machines connected to C2 servers to maintain communication through a slow, rhythmic signal."
What actions did the COI Committee take regarding the cyber breach?,"The Committee made a total of 16 recommendations, with 7 of them designated as priority ones to be implemented immediately."
Summarize Recommendation #1 from the COI Committee.,"Recommendation #1 emphasizes the adoption of an enhanced security structure and readiness by IHiS and Public Health Institutions. It states that cybersecurity should be treated as a risk management issue, not just a technical one, with decisions made at the appropriate management level to balance security, operational needs, and costs. IHiS is also advised to adopt a 'defence-in-depth' approach and address gaps between policy and practice."
Detail Recommendation #2 concerning the cyber stack.,"Recommendation #2 calls for a review of the cyber stack to ensure its adequacy in defending against and responding to advanced threats. This involves identifying gaps by mapping IT stack layers against existing security technologies, filling response technology gaps by acquiring endpoint and network forensics capabilities, reviewing current endpoint security measures to address exploited gaps, enhancing network security to disrupt 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain, and heightening application security for email."
What are the key points of Recommendation #3 regarding staff awareness?,"Recommendation #3 focuses on improving staff awareness on cybersecurity to enhance the capacity for preventing, detecting, and responding to security incidents. This includes improving cyber hygiene among users, implementing a Security Awareness Programme to reduce organizational risk, and ensuring IT staff possess sufficient knowledge to recognize security incident signs in a real-world context."
Explain Recommendation #4 about enhanced security checks.,"Recommendation #4 mandates enhanced security checks, particularly on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems. This involves conducting regular vulnerability assessments, performing safety reviews, evaluations, and certifications of vendor products where feasible, regularly conducting penetration testing, periodically carrying out red teaming exercises, and considering threat hunting."
Summarize Recommendation #5 regarding privileged administrator accounts.,"Recommendation #5 requires privileged administrator accounts to be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring. This includes creating an inventory of administrative accounts for rationalization, mandating two-factor authentication for all administrators performing administrative tasks, considering the use of passphrases instead of passwords to reduce compromise risk, implementing and enforcing password policies across domain and local accounts, centrally managing server local administrator accounts across the IT network, and managing and controlling service accounts with high privileges."
Describe the vulnerability that allowed the hacking tool installation.,The hacking tool was installed by exploiting a vulnerability present in the specific version of the Outlook application that was installed on Workstation A. This vulnerability was not patched at the time of the incident.
What is the significance of 'IOCs' in the context of C2 infrastructure?,"In the context of C2 infrastructure, 'IOCs' stand for Indicators of Compromise. CSA's forensic analysis revealed a number of network IOCs that appeared to be overseas C2 servers, indicating their involvement in the cyber breach."
Define 'Infection' as it relates to C2 server usage.,'Infection' refers to the use of a server as a means of dropping malware into a system that it is attempting to infect.
Define 'Data exfiltration' in the context of cyber breaches.,"'Data exfiltration' refers to the act of technical data being sent from a compromised system to external servers, as indicated by the analysis of C2 server activity."
Explain the concept of 'Beacon' in relation to C2 servers.,"'Beacon' describes the activity where infected machines connect to C2 servers to establish a 'heartbeat'. This 'heartbeat' is a slow, rhythmic communication pattern used solely to sustain the connection and communication between the infected machine and the C2 server."
"How many recommendations were made by the COI Committee, and how many were priority ones?","The Committee made a total of 16 recommendations, of which 7 were designated as priority ones."
What is the core principle of Recommendation #1 regarding cybersecurity?,"The core principle of Recommendation #1 is that cybersecurity must be viewed as a risk management issue, not merely a technical one. Decisions should be made at the appropriate management level to balance security, operational requirements, and cost."
What approach should IHiS adopt according to Recommendation #1?,"According to Recommendation #1, IHiS must adopt a 'defence-in-depth' approach to cybersecurity."
What needs to be addressed according to Recommendation #1?,"According to Recommendation #1, gaps between policy and practice must be addressed."
What is the objective of reviewing the cyber stack as per Recommendation #2?,"The objective of reviewing the cyber stack, as per Recommendation #2, is to assess its adequacy in defending against and responding to advanced threats."
How can gaps in the cyber stack be identified?,Gaps in the cyber stack can be identified by mapping the layers of the IT stack against existing security technologies.
What capabilities are needed to fill gaps in response technologies?,"To fill gaps in response technologies, organizations need to acquire endpoint and network forensics capabilities."
What should be reviewed to fill exploited gaps?,The effectiveness of current endpoint security measures must be reviewed to fill the gaps that were exploited by the attacker.
How can network security be enhanced to disrupt the Cyber Kill Chain?,Network security can be enhanced to disrupt the 'Command and Control' and 'Actions on Objective' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain.
What specific application security needs to be heightened?,Application security for email must be heightened.
What is the goal of Recommendation #3?,"The goal of Recommendation #3 is to improve staff awareness on cybersecurity to enhance the capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents."
What should continue to be improved among users?,The level of cyber hygiene among users must continue to be improved.
What program should be implemented to reduce organizational risk?,A Security Awareness Programme should be implemented to reduce organizational risk.
What knowledge should IT staff be equipped with?,IT staff must be equipped with sufficient knowledge to recognize the signs of a security incident in a real-world context.
What kind of checks are mandated by Recommendation #4?,Recommendation #4 mandates enhanced security checks.
On which systems should enhanced security checks be performed?,"Enhanced security checks must be performed, especially on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems."
How often should vulnerability assessments be conducted?,Vulnerability assessments must be conducted regularly.
