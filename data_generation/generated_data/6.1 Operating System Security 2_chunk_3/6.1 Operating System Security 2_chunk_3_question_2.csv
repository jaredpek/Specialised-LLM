What is an Application-based RM?,"An Application-based RM (Runtime Monitor) is a security mechanism that is embedded directly within applications. Its primary functions are to enforce access control policies, provide fine-grained control over application behaviors, and prevent unauthorized actions."
How is RM integrated with an interpreter?,"When RM is integrated with an interpreter, every operation is checked against security policies before execution. A common example is a JavaScript engine, which enforces sandboxing by restricting access to certain APIs or resources during script execution."
What is Inline RM?,Inline RM involves inserting the Runtime Monitor directly into the application's code. This can be achieved through methods like source code instrumentation or binary rewriting. An example of this approach is StackGuard.
What is the purpose of Hardware-based RM?,"Hardware-based RM is responsible for monitoring and regulating all software activities, including the OS kernel. Any operation that violates a security policy will trigger a hardware exception."
What kind of checking does Hardware-based RM perform?,"Hardware-based RMs conduct various types of checking. This includes memory access management, ensuring that each memory access is within the process's memory range and adheres to allowed permissions (read, write, executable) as set in the Page Table Entry. It also involves privilege mode management, where the CPU can be in either user or kernel mode, with privileged instructions only executable in kernel mode, and context switches required for user mode to call privileged functions."
What is a Page Table Entry in the context of Hardware-based RM?,"In the context of Hardware-based RM and memory access management, a Page Table Entry (PTE) is a data structure that stores information about memory pages. It includes details about the allowed permissions for accessing that memory, such as read, write, and executable rights. This mechanism helps in enforcing memory access control."
Explain privilege mode management in Hardware-based RM.,"Privilege mode management in Hardware-based RM refers to the different operational states of the CPU. The CPU can operate in either user mode or kernel mode at any given time. Privileged instructions, which have the potential to affect the entire system, can only be issued when the CPU is in kernel mode. When the CPU is in user mode and needs to execute a privileged function, a context switch is required to transition to kernel mode."
What is a Firewall in the context of Network-based RM?,"A Firewall, in the context of Network-based RM (Runtime Monitor), is a security mechanism that monitors and regulates network traffic based on predefined security policies. It can define outbound policies for traffic leaving the network and inbound policies for traffic entering the network."
What are the possible actions a Firewall can take?,A Firewall can take several actions based on security policies: 'Allow' permits traffic through the firewall. 'Deny' prevents traffic from passing through the firewall. 'Alert' sends a notification to the administrator when specific traffic is detected.
What is an Outbound policy in a Firewall?,An Outbound policy in a Firewall defines the network traffic that is permitted to exit the network. It specifies the rules that govern outgoing connections and data transmissions.
What is an Inbound policy in a Firewall?,An Inbound policy in a Firewall defines the network traffic that is permitted to enter the network. It specifies the rules that govern incoming connections and data transmissions.

What does it mean for encryption to be 'transparent' with hardware solutions?,"When encryption is 'transparent' with hardware solutions, it means that the encryption and decryption processes occur automatically in the background, managed by the hardware, with minimal or no direct interaction required from the user. This simplifies the user experience while maintaining strong security."
What is the primary goal of Remote Attestation?,The primary goal of Remote Attestation is to allow a user to remotely verify that an application is running securely on a trusted platform. It provides assurance about the integrity and trustworthiness of the software environment.
What is the significance of 'unforgeable evidence' in Remote Attestation?,'Unforgeable evidence' in Remote Attestation refers to security reports generated by the remote platform that cannot be tampered with or falsified by an attacker. This ensures the client can trust the information provided about the platform's security.
How does a Firewall handle traffic that matches a specific destination address and port?,"A Firewall handles traffic based on its rules. For example, a rule might specify that TCP traffic destined for IP address 192.168.42.55 on port 25 should be 'Allow'ed. If traffic matches this rule, it will be permitted through the firewall."
What does it mean for a Firewall to 'Deny' traffic?,"When a Firewall 'Deny's traffic, it means that the traffic is not allowed to pass through the firewall. This action is taken when the traffic violates a security policy or matches a rule that explicitly prohibits its passage."
What is the role of a 'context switch' in Privilege mode management?,"A context switch is required in Privilege mode management when a process running in user mode needs to execute a privileged instruction or call a function that requires kernel mode privileges. The operating system performs a context switch to transition the CPU from user mode to kernel mode, allowing the privileged operation to occur."
What is the difference between user mode and kernel mode?,"User mode is a restricted mode of operation for the CPU where applications run with limited privileges. Kernel mode, also known as supervisor mode or privileged mode, is a more powerful mode where the operating system kernel runs and has full access to the system's hardware and resources. Privileged instructions can only be executed in kernel mode."
What is the purpose of 'source code instrumentation' in Inline RM?,"Source code instrumentation, in the context of Inline RM, involves modifying the application's source code to insert Runtime Monitor (RM) code. This allows for the RM to be directly integrated into the application's logic, enabling fine-grained control and monitoring of its execution."
What is the relationship between a Firewall and security policies?,"A Firewall's operation is entirely based on security policies. It monitors and regulates network traffic by comparing incoming and outgoing data packets against these predefined policies to determine whether to allow, deny, or alert on the traffic."
What is the significance of 'privileged instructions' in the context of CPU modes?,"Privileged instructions are special commands that can only be executed when the CPU is in kernel mode. These instructions typically perform sensitive operations that affect the entire system, such as managing memory, controlling hardware devices, or modifying system settings. Executing them in user mode would pose a security risk."
What is the function of a Reference Monitor?,The function of a Reference Monitor is to mediate all access to system resources (objects) by subjects. It enforces security policies by checking every access request to ensure it is permitted according to the defined rules. It is designed to be tamper-proof and always invoked.
