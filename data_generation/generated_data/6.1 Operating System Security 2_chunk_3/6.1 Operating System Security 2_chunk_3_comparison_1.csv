Compare Application-based RM with Hardware-based RM.,"Application-based RM is a security mechanism embedded within applications that enforces access control policies, provides fine-grained control over application behaviors, and prevents unauthorized actions. It can be integrated with an interpreter, where every operation is checked against security policies before execution, or implemented as Inline RM by inserting it directly into the application's code through source code instrumentation or binary rewriting. An example is StackGuard.

Hardware-based RM is responsible for monitoring and regulating all software activities, including the OS kernel. Any operation violating the security policy will trigger a hardware exception. These RMs conduct various checks, including memory access management (ensuring accesses are within the process' memory range and follow allowed permissions like read, write, executable, as set in the Page Table Entry) and privilege mode management (managing CPU modes between user and kernel, restricting privileged instructions to kernel mode, and requiring context switches for user mode to call privileged functions)."
What are the differences between Application-based RM and Network-based RM?,"Application-based RM is a security mechanism embedded within applications to enforce access control policies and control application behaviors. It can be integrated with interpreters or directly inserted into application code. In contrast, Network-based RM, exemplified by a firewall, monitors and regulates network traffic based on security policies. It defines outbound policies (traffic allowed to exit the network) and inbound policies (traffic allowed to enter the network). Firewalls can perform actions such as allowing traffic, denying traffic, or alerting administrators. The core difference lies in their scope: Application-based RM focuses on internal application security, while Network-based RM focuses on external network security."
Explain the concept of Inline RM within Application-based RM.,"Inline RM, within the context of Application-based RM, refers to the method of inserting the RM directly into the application's code. This integration can be achieved through two primary techniques: source code instrumentation, where code is added to the application's source to incorporate RM functionalities, or binary rewriting, where the compiled binary code of the application is modified to include the RM. An example of Inline RM is StackGuard."
Describe the function of a Firewall as a Network-based RM.,"A Firewall, as a Network-based RM, functions to monitor and regulate network traffic based on predefined security policies. It establishes rules for both outbound traffic, defining what is permitted to exit the network, and inbound traffic, defining what is allowed to enter the network. The possible actions a firewall can take include 'Allow,' permitting traffic through, 'Deny,' blocking traffic, and 'Alert,' notifying an administrator of specific network events. Essentially, it acts as a gatekeeper for network communications."
What is the role of Hardware-based RM in monitoring software activities?,"Hardware-based RM plays a crucial role in monitoring and regulating all software activities, including those of the OS kernel. Its primary mechanism for enforcing security policies is by triggering a hardware exception whenever an operation violates these policies. This ensures that security violations are immediately and forcefully addressed at the hardware level."
Explain memory access management as performed by Hardware-based RMs.,"Memory access management, as conducted by Hardware-based RMs, involves verifying that each memory access made by a process adheres to security constraints. This includes two key checks: first, ensuring that the memory access is confined within the allocated memory range of the process, and second, confirming that the access complies with the allowed permissions (such as read, write, or executable) as specified in the Page Table Entry. This mechanism is related to concepts like Non-executable Memory."
What is privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs?,"Privilege mode management, as implemented by Hardware-based RMs, pertains to the control over the CPU's operational modes. The CPU can operate in either 'user' mode or 'kernel' mode at any given time. Privileged instructions, which are powerful commands that can affect the entire system, can only be executed when the CPU is in kernel mode. If a process in user mode needs to execute a privileged function, a context switch is required to transition the CPU to kernel mode."
Describe the concept of Application-based RM and its core functions.,"Application-based RM is a security mechanism that is embedded directly within applications. Its primary functions are to enforce access control policies, provide fine-grained control over the specific behaviors of an application, and prevent any unauthorized actions from occurring within that application. It acts as an internal security layer for the software."
What are the two main ways to integrate RM with an interpreter?,"RM can be integrated with an interpreter in two main ways. The first is by ensuring that every operation is checked against security policies before it is executed by the interpreter. The second way is exemplified by a JavaScript engine, which enforces sandboxing by restricting the script's access to certain APIs or resources during its execution."
What is an outbound policy and an inbound policy in the context of a Firewall?,"In the context of a Firewall, an outbound policy defines what network traffic is allowed to exit the network. Conversely, an inbound policy defines what network traffic is allowed to enter the network. These policies are crucial for controlling the flow of data into and out of a protected network."
List the possible actions a Firewall can take.,"A Firewall can perform several actions based on its security policies. These actions include: 'Allow,' which permits the traffic to pass through the firewall; 'Deny,' which blocks the traffic from passing; and 'Alert,' which sends a notification to the system administrator about the traffic."
Compare the reliability of software and hardware for security purposes.,"Hardware is generally considered more reliable than software for security purposes. This is because once a chip is fabricated, it is extremely difficult for an attacker to modify it, thus guaranteeing the integrity of the hardware.

Explain the concept of 'fine-grained control' in Application-based RM.,"Fine-grained control in Application-based RM refers to the ability to precisely manage and restrict specific actions or behaviors within an application. Instead of broad permissions, it allows for detailed policies that dictate exactly what an application can and cannot do, ensuring that its operations are confined to intended and authorized activities."
What is the role of a security policy in a Network-based RM like a firewall?,"A security policy is fundamental to a Network-based RM like a firewall. It dictates the rules that govern network traffic. This policy defines what traffic is permitted or denied, both for traffic leaving the network (outbound policy) and traffic entering the network (inbound policy). The firewall enforces these rules to protect the network."
What does it mean for software to be 'not always trusted'?,"The statement 'software is not always trusted' implies that software, particularly privileged software like operating systems and hypervisors, often has very large code bases that inevitably contain numerous vulnerabilities. Once compromised, such software can be exploited by attackers to gain control over any applications running on the system."
How does hardware offer greater reliability for security compared to software?,"Hardware offers greater reliability for security because its physical nature makes it inherently difficult to modify after fabrication, thus guaranteeing its integrity.
