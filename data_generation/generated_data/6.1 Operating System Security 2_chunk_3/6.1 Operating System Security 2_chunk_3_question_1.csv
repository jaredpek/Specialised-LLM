What is Application-based RM?,"Application-based RM (Reference Monitor) is a security mechanism that is embedded directly within applications. Its primary functions are to enforce access control policies, provide fine-grained control over application behaviors, and prevent unauthorized actions."
How is RM integrated with an interpreter?,"When RM is integrated with an interpreter, every operation is checked against security policies before execution. A key example is a JavaScript engine, which enforces sandboxing by restricting access to certain APIs or resources during script execution."
What is Inline RM?,Inline RM involves inserting the Reference Monitor directly into the application's code. This can be achieved through methods such as source code instrumentation or binary rewriting. An example of this approach is StackGuard.
What is Hardware-based RM?,"Hardware-based RM is responsible for monitoring and regulating all software activities, including the OS kernel. A critical aspect is that any operation violating the security policy will trigger a hardware exception."
What types of checking do Hardware-based RMs perform?,"Hardware-based RMs conduct various types of checking, including memory access management and privilege mode management. For memory access, they ensure that each access is within the process's memory range and adheres to the allowed permissions (read, write, executable) as set in the Page Table Entry. For privilege mode management, they monitor the CPU's mode (user or kernel), ensure privileged instructions are only issued in kernel mode, and manage context switches required for user mode to call privileged functions."
Explain memory access management in Hardware-based RMs.,"Memory access management within Hardware-based RMs ensures that every memory access operation stays within the boundaries of the process's allocated memory range. Furthermore, it verifies that each access complies with the permissions defined in the Page Table Entry, which specify whether the access is allowed for reading, writing, or execution. This mechanism is related to the Non-executable Memory concept."
Describe privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs.,"Privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs pertains to the CPU's operating modes, which can be either user mode or kernel mode at any given time. Privileged instructions, which have higher system control, can only be executed when the CPU is in kernel mode. When a process in user mode needs to execute a privileged function, a context switch is required to transition to kernel mode."
What is a Firewall in the context of Network-based RM?,"A Firewall, in the context of Network-based RM (Reference Monitor), is a system designed to monitor and regulate network traffic based on predefined security policies. It defines outbound policies to control traffic exiting the network and inbound policies to manage traffic entering the network. Firewalls can perform actions such as allowing traffic, denying traffic, or sending alerts to administrators."
What are the possible actions a Firewall can take?,A Firewall can take several actions based on its security policies: 'Allow' permits the traffic to pass through. 'Deny' blocks the traffic from entering or exiting the network. 'Alert' sends a notification to the administrator when specific traffic is detected.
What is the difference between inbound and outbound policies in a Firewall?,"An outbound policy in a Firewall defines which network traffic is permitted to exit the network. Conversely, an inbound policy defines which network traffic is allowed to enter the network."
