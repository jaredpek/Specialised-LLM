What is Application-based RM?,"Application-based RM (Reference Monitor) is a security mechanism that is embedded directly within applications. Its primary functions are to enforce access control policies, provide fine-grained control over application behaviors, and prevent unauthorized actions."
How is RM integrated with an interpreter?,"When RM is integrated with an interpreter, every operation is checked against security policies before execution. A common example is a JavaScript engine, which enforces sandboxing by restricting access to certain APIs or resources during script execution."
What is Inline RM?,Inline RM involves inserting the Reference Monitor directly into the application's code. This can be achieved through methods such as source code instrumentation or binary rewriting. An example of this approach is StackGuard.
What is Hardware-based RM?,"Hardware-based RM is responsible for monitoring and regulating all software activities, including the OS kernel. A key characteristic is that any operation violating a security policy will trigger a hardware exception."
What types of checking do Hardware-based RMs perform?,"Hardware-based RMs conduct various types of checking, including memory access management and privilege mode management. For memory access, they ensure that each access is within the process's memory range and adheres to the allowed permissions (read, write, executable) as defined in the Page Table Entry. For privilege mode management, they monitor the CPU's mode (user or kernel), ensure privileged instructions are only issued in kernel mode, and manage context switches required for user mode to call privileged functions."
Explain memory access management in Hardware-based RMs.,"Memory access management in Hardware-based RMs ensures that every memory access made by a process stays within its allocated memory range. Furthermore, it verifies that each access complies with the permissions set for that memory region, such as read, write, or executable permissions, which are typically defined in the Page Table Entry. This is related to mechanisms like Non-executable Memory."
Describe privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs.,"Privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs pertains to the CPU's operating modes, which can be either user mode or kernel mode. The system ensures that privileged instructions, which have elevated access rights, can only be executed when the CPU is in kernel mode. When a process in user mode needs to execute a privileged function, a context switch is required to transition the CPU to kernel mode."
What is a Firewall in the context of Network-based RM?,"A Firewall, in the context of Network-based RM (Reference Monitor), is a system that monitors and regulates network traffic according to defined security policies. It can define outbound policies, specifying which traffic is allowed to leave the network, and inbound policies, specifying which traffic is allowed to enter the network. Firewalls can perform actions such as allowing traffic, denying traffic, or sending alerts to an administrator."
What are the possible actions a Firewall can take?,A Firewall can take several actions based on its security policies: 'Allow' permits the traffic to pass through the firewall. 'Deny' prevents the traffic from passing through the firewall. 'Alert' sends a notification to the administrator about the traffic.
What is the difference between inbound and outbound policies for a Firewall?,"An outbound policy for a Firewall defines what network traffic is permitted to exit the network. Conversely, an inbound policy defines what network traffic is allowed to enter the network."
What are Protection Strategies?,Protection Strategies are high-level approaches to securing systems. The document mentions two main categories: Confinement and Reference Monitor. It also discusses Hardware-assisted Protection as a distinct but related area.
