Define Application-based RM.,"Application-based RM (Reference Monitor) is a security mechanism that is embedded within applications. Its primary functions are to enforce access control policies, provide fine-grained control over application behaviors, and prevent unauthorized actions."
Explain how RM is integrated with an interpreter.,"When RM is integrated with an interpreter, every operation is checked against security policies before execution. A key example of this is a JavaScript engine, which enforces sandboxing by restricting access to certain APIs or resources during script execution."
Describe Inline RM.,Inline RM involves inserting the Reference Monitor directly into the application's code. This can be achieved through methods such as source code instrumentation or binary rewriting. An example of this approach is StackGuard.
What is Hardware-based RM?,"Hardware-based RM is responsible for monitoring and regulating all software activities, including the OS kernel. Any operation that violates the security policy will trigger a hardware exception."
Detail the checking mechanisms of Hardware-based RMs.,"Hardware-based RMs conduct various checks, including memory access management and privilege mode management. For memory access, they verify if each access is within the process's memory range and if it adheres to the allowed permissions (read, write, executable) as set in the Page Table Entry, similar to the Non-executable Memory mechanism. For privilege mode management, they ensure that the CPU is in either user or kernel mode at any given time, that privileged instructions are only issued in kernel mode, and that a context switch is required for user mode to call privileged functions."
Explain Memory access management in Hardware-based RMs.,"Memory access management within Hardware-based RMs involves verifying two key aspects: first, that each memory access occurs within the designated memory range of the process, and second, that each access conforms to the permitted operations (read, write, executable) as defined in the Page Table Entry. This is analogous to the Non-executable Memory mechanism."
Describe Privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs.,"Privilege mode management in Hardware-based RMs pertains to the CPU's operational state. The CPU can operate in either user mode or kernel mode. Privileged instructions, which are sensitive operations, can only be executed when the CPU is in kernel mode. Consequently, when a user-mode process needs to invoke a privileged function, a context switch is necessary to transition the CPU to kernel mode."
What is a Firewall in the context of Network-based RM?,"A Firewall, in the context of Network-based RM, is a system designed to monitor and regulate network traffic based on predefined security policies. It can define outbound policies to control what traffic is allowed to exit the network and inbound policies to control what traffic is permitted to enter the network. Firewalls can perform actions such as allowing traffic, denying traffic, or alerting an administrator."
Explain the policies and actions of a Firewall.,"A Firewall operates based on policies and can take specific actions. An outbound policy dictates which traffic is permitted to leave the network, while an inbound policy determines which traffic is allowed to enter. The possible actions a firewall can take are: Allow (permitting traffic through), Deny (blocking traffic), and Alert (sending a notification to the administrator)."
What are the possible actions a Firewall can take?,"A Firewall can perform three main actions: Allow, which permits traffic to pass through; Deny, which blocks traffic from passing; and Alert, which sends a notification to the system administrator."

What are the components of Hardware-assisted Protection?,"Hardware-assisted Protection encompasses Basic Functionalities, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)."
Why is software not always trusted?,"Software is not always trusted because privileged software, such as operating systems and hypervisors, typically has a very large codebase that inevitably contains numerous vulnerabilities. If such software is compromised, an attacker can gain control over any applications running on the system."
What are the implications of privileged software being compromised?,"If privileged software, like an operating system or hypervisor, is compromised, an attacker gains the ability to perform any action on any application running on that system. This is due to the extensive control that privileged software has over the system's resources."
Explain why hardware is considered more reliable for security.,"Hardware is considered more reliable for security because once a chip is fabricated, it is extremely difficult for an attacker to modify it, thus guaranteeing the integrity of the hardware. Furthermore, it is very hard for attackers to access the internal components of the chip to steal secrets, such as encryption keys, ensuring the confidentiality of the hardware. This makes it more reliable to incorporate security-aware hardware to protect operating systems and applications."
How is the integrity of hardware guaranteed?,"The integrity of hardware is guaranteed because, after the chip is fabricated, it is extremely difficult for an attacker to modify its physical structure or internal workings."
How is the confidentiality of hardware guaranteed?,"The confidentiality of hardware is guaranteed because it is very difficult for an attacker to physically access the chip and steal sensitive information, such as encryption keys."

Define Remote Attestation.,"Remote Attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify whether an application is executing securely on a trusted platform. It involves a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client, thereby proving that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy."
How does Remote Attestation work?,Remote Attestation allows a user to confirm the security of an application's execution on a trusted platform.

It achieves this by allowing a remote platform to provide unforgeable evidence about its software's security to a client.
What are the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the integrity measurement architecture and the remote attestation protocol. The integrity measurement architecture is responsible for generating a reliable and trustworthy security report, while the remote attestation protocol ensures that this report is transmitted to the client without being tampered with by attackers in the OS, applications, or network."
Describe the Integrity measurement architecture in remote attestation.,The Integrity measurement architecture is a key component of remote attestation. Its role is to provide a reliable and trustworthy security report that attests to the state of the software running on a platform.
Explain the Remote attestation protocol.,"The Remote attestation protocol is a crucial component of remote attestation that ensures the secure transmission of the attestation report. It guarantees that the report, which contains evidence of the platform's security, is delivered to the client without any modifications by malicious actors within the operating system, applications, or network."
What is the role of the Remote attestation protocol?,"The role of the Remote attestation protocol is to ensure that the attestation report is transmitted to the client in a secure manner, preventing any unauthorized modifications by attackers operating at the OS, application, or network level."
