Compare a brute force guessing attack with a dictionary attack.,"A **brute force guessing attack** against passwords attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence, then checking if they match the target hashes. In contrast, a **dictionary attack** exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which often derive from words in natural languages. It involves guessing commonly used passwords, computing their hash values, and then looking for these hash values in the password file. While choosing passwords with **high entropy** (a measure of the unpredictability of a password, often expressed as the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords) can prevent brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially human-generated ones, remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks."
What are the differences between the effectiveness of high entropy passwords against brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks?,"High entropy passwords are an effective measure against **brute-force attacks**, which involve systematically trying every possible password combination. By increasing the **password space** (the total number of possible passwords, e.g., through longer passwords or more varieties of symbols), high entropy makes it computationally infeasible for an attacker to enumerate all possibilities. However, **dictionary attacks**, which exploit human tendencies to choose common or dictionary words, can still be effective against hashed passwords, even if they have high entropy, provided the chosen password is a common word or phrase. This is because dictionary attacks do not rely on enumerating all possibilities but rather on a pre-compiled list of likely passwords."
"Compare the cracking capabilities of a 3GHz PC, an FPGA hardware cracker, and an ASIC cracker.","The cracking capabilities of different hardware vary significantly. A **3GHz PC** can crack a password with 2^35 complexity within approximately one day (generous estimate). An **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware cracker** is more specialized and can crack 56 bits of complexity within five days (estimated). An **ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) cracker** represents the highest level of specialized hardware for cracking and is significantly faster, being more than 10 times faster than an FPGA."
What are the differences in how password length ('n') and character choices ('c') affect the bitsize of password space?,"The **bitsize of password space**, denoted as 'k', is a measure of password entropy and is calculated as the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. The total number of possible passwords is given by c^n, where 'c' is the number of choices per character (e.g., 26 for lowercase alphabets) and 'n' is the password length. Both 'c' and 'n' contribute to increasing the password space, but 'n' has an exponential impact. For example, increasing 'n' from 5 to 10 for lowercase passwords (c=26) increases 'k' from 23.5 to 47.0. Similarly, increasing 'c' from 26 (lowercase) to 95 (keyboard characters) for a 5-character password ('n'=5) increases 'k' from 23.5 to 32.9. Thus, while both are crucial, increasing password length ('n') generally leads to a more rapid increase in the bitsize of password space due to its exponential role."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character lowercase password versus a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 5-character password, the **bitsize of password space** (k) differs based on the character set.

In contrast, a 5-character **mixed case alphanumeric password**, which allows for 62 choices per character (alphabets and numerals), has a significantly larger bitsize of password space, specifically 29.8. This demonstrates that increasing the variety of symbols available per character ('c') directly increases the password's entropy and thus its resistance to brute-force attacks."

However, if the password uses **keyboard characters** (95 choices per character), which include a wider variety of symbols, alphabets, and numerals, the bitsize of password space increases to 46.0.

Compare the general approach of a brute force attack with the specific strategy of using a pre-computed hash table.,"A **brute force attack** is a general method of guessing a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence until a match is found. It's a trial-and-error approach. In contrast, using a **pre-computed hash table** is a specific strategy for cracking *hashed passwords*, often used in offline attacks. This strategy involves creating a table that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hashes in advance. Instead of computing hashes for every guess in real-time, an attacker can simply look up a target hash in the pre-computed table to find the original password. While a pre-computed hash table can speed up the process of finding passwords, it may not be practical if the number of password candidates ('k') is very large, as the table size would be k × n (where 'n' is the hash bit length)."
What are the differences between the impact of increasing password space and implementing a password policy as measures against brute force attacks?,"**Increasing the space of possible passwords** is a direct technical measure against brute force attacks. This involves making passwords longer and allowing for a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), which exponentially increases the number of possible combinations an attacker must try. A **password policy**, on the other hand, is an organizational or system-level rule set that dictates the requirements for creating passwords (e.g., minimum length, character types, complexity). It serves as an important means to *implement* and *enforce* the increase in password space. For example, a policy requiring 10-character mixed-case alphanumeric passwords directly leads to a larger password space, thereby increasing the difficulties of a brute force attack."
Compare the vulnerability of high entropy passwords to brute force attacks versus dictionary attacks.,"**High entropy passwords** are highly effective at preventing **brute force attacks**. High entropy means the password has a large **password space** (number of possible combinations), making it computationally infeasible for an attacker to guess by enumerating all possibilities. However, even passwords with high entropy can be vulnerable to **dictionary attacks** if they are human-generated and derive from words or common phrases in natural languages. Dictionary attacks do not rely on brute-forcing the entire password space but rather on guessing commonly used passwords and checking their hashes. Therefore, while high entropy protects against systematic enumeration, it doesn't inherently protect against passwords chosen from a common lexicon."
What are the differences between storing password hashes without salt and storing them with salt?,"When storing **password hashes without salt**, if two users have the same password, their stored hash values will be identical. This makes them vulnerable to attacks like **pre-computed hash tables** (rainbow tables) or dictionary attacks where an attacker can pre-compute hashes for common passwords and quickly find matches. When storing password hashes **with salt**, a unique, random string (the **salt**) is added to each password *before* the hash function is applied. Each password has its own salt, and this salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different because different salts were used. This significantly reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, as the attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same password* for an n-bit salt, making the attack much more resource-intensive."
Compare the attacker's effort for pre-computed hash tables without salting versus with salting.,"Without **salting**, an attacker using **pre-computed hash tables** (a strategy for cracking hashed passwords by looking up pre-calculated password-hash pairs) can generate a single table of common passwords and their hashes. This table can then be used to crack multiple user accounts if they share the same password, as identical passwords will yield identical hashes. This significantly reduces the attacker's effort. With **salting**, a unique random string (the **salt**) is added to each password before hashing. The salt is stored alongside the hash. This means that for a salt of 'n' bits, the attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for *each specific password* they want to crack, rather than a single table for all passwords. This dramatically increases the attacker's computational and storage effort, making pre-computed hash table attacks much less effective and often impractical."
What are the differences between the calculation of password complexity for a 5-character lowercase password and a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"The **complexity** of a password, often referred to as its **bitsize of password space** (k), is calculated by solving 2^k = c^n, where 'c' is the number of choices per character and 'n' is the password length. For a **5-character lowercase password**, 'c' is 26. The calculation is k = [lg(26^5)]/lg2, which results in a complexity of 23.5 bits. For a **5-character mixed case alphanumeric password**, 'c' is 62. The calculation would be k = [lg(62^5)]/lg2, which results in a complexity of 29.8 bits. The key difference lies in the value of 'c', where the larger character set of mixed case alphanumeric passwords leads to a higher 'k' value, indicating greater complexity and resistance to brute-force attacks."
Compare the purpose of a password policy with the direct effect of increasing password space in mitigating brute force attacks.,"A **password policy** serves as an important *means* to increase the difficulties of brute force attacks by setting rules and requirements for password creation. Its purpose is to guide users or systems to create stronger passwords. The **direct effect of increasing password space**, on the other hand, is the *outcome* of adhering to such policies. It refers to the actual expansion of the total number of possible passwords (e.g., by requiring longer passwords or more diverse character sets like alphabets, numerals, and signs). This larger password space makes it exponentially more difficult and time-consuming for a brute force attack to enumerate all possible combinations. Thus, a password policy is the directive, and increasing password space is the measurable security enhancement it achieves."
What are the differences between the vulnerability of human-generated passwords and the protection offered by high entropy against brute-force attacks?,"**Human-generated passwords** are inherently prone to weaknesses because people tend to choose words or patterns that are easy to remember, often deriving from natural languages. This makes them particularly vulnerable to **dictionary attacks**, even if they might appear to have some complexity. In contrast, **high entropy** is a measure of a password's unpredictability and randomness, which directly translates to a larger **password space** (the total number of possible passwords). High entropy offers strong protection against **brute-force attacks** because it makes it computationally infeasible for an attacker to enumerate all possible combinations. However, if a human-generated password, despite having a theoretically high entropy, is still a common word or phrase, it remains susceptible to dictionary attacks."
