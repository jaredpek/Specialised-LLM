Provide a comprehensive summary of what a brute force attack entails.,"A brute force guessing attack against passwords is a method where an attacker attempts to discover a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. After generating each potential password and its hash, the attacker checks if it matches the target hashes stored in a system. This process continues until a match is found or all possibilities have been exhausted."
Summarise the primary measure to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack.,"The primary measure to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack is to significantly expand the ""space of possible passwords"". This is achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, including alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs. A robust password policy is an important means to implement these measures and thereby increase the difficulties for attackers."
Can you summarise the key considerations behind an effective password policy in relation to brute force attacks?,"An effective password policy is crucial for increasing the difficulty of brute force attacks. The key consideration is to enforce parameters that expand the ""space of possible passwords"". This typically involves requiring users to create longer passwords and to incorporate a diverse set of characters, such as alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and various signs. By doing so, the number of potential password combinations an attacker must enumerate grows exponentially, making brute force attacks significantly more time-consuming and resource-intensive."
Explain the concept of password entropy as measured by 2^k.,"Password entropy, when measured by 2^k, quantifies the strength or unpredictability of a password. Here, 'k' represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords within a given character set and length. For an n-character password, where each character can be chosen from 'c' distinct options, the total number of possible passwords is c^n. The value 'k' is then derived by solving the equation 2^k = c^n, which can be calculated as k = [lg(c^n)]/lg2. A higher 'k' value indicates a larger and more complex password space, making it harder for attackers to guess."
Summarize the information presented in Table 10.1 regarding password space.,"Table 10.1 illustrates the bitsize of password space for various character combinations, which is a measure of password entropy. The table shows how the 'bitsize' (represented by 'k' in 2^k) changes based on the password length ('n') and the number of character choices per character ('c'). Specifically, it provides the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, where the total number of passwords is calculated as c^n. Different columns represent different character sets, such as lowercase, lowercase alphanumeric, mixed case alphanumeric, and keyboard characters, each with a corresponding 'c' value."
"Explain the first entry in Table 10.1, specifically for a 5-character lowercase password.","The first entry in Table 10.1 corresponds to a 5-character lowercase password. For lowercase characters, there are 26 possible choices per character ('c' = 26). With a password length of 5 characters ('n' = 5), the total number of possible passwords is 26^5. To find the complexity or bitsize 'k', we solve 2^k = 26^5. This calculation yields k = [lg(26^5)]/lg2, which is approximately 23.5. This means there are effectively 2^23.5 possible passwords for this specific combination."
What is the current estimated speed of software password crackers?,"At present, software password crackers are estimated to be capable of cracking up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pswd/sec per pc)."

Compare the speed of ASIC crackers relative to FPGA hardware crackers.,"ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster than FPGA hardware crackers, being more than 10 times faster."
Provide a comprehensive summary of what a dictionary attack is.,"A dictionary attack is a type of password attack that exploits the tendency of human-chosen passwords to be derived from words in natural languages. Unlike brute-force attacks, which try all combinations, a dictionary attack works by guessing commonly used passwords, often sourced from dictionaries or lists of frequently used passwords. The attacker computes the hash values of these guessed passwords and then compares them against the stored hash values in a password file to find a match. This attack is effective even against hashed passwords, especially those generated by humans."
Summarize the specific vulnerability that dictionary attacks exploit in human-generated passwords.,"Dictionary attacks specifically exploit the inherent weakness in human-chosen passwords, which tend to be derived from words or phrases found in natural languages. This makes human-generated passwords vulnerable because attackers can compile lists of common words and phrases (a 'dictionary') and use them to guess passwords, even if they are hashed. The high entropy that prevents brute-force attacks does not fully protect against dictionary attacks if the chosen password is a common word."
Can you summarise the key steps involved in a dictionary attack?,"The key steps involved in a dictionary attack are: first, the attacker guesses some commonly used passwords, typically from a pre-compiled list or dictionary. Second, they compute the hash values for each of these guessed passwords. Third, the attacker then looks for these computed hash values within the target password file, attempting to find a match with the stored hash values. If a match is found, the corresponding password has been successfully cracked."
Describe the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking hashed passwords.,"The strategy for cracking hashed passwords using a pre-computed hash table involves creating a large table beforehand that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hashes. This table is then used to quickly look up the original password if an attacker obtains a hash value. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table would be of size 'k × n'. However, this approach may not be practical if the number of password candidates ('k') is very large, as the table size would become unmanageable."
What is a key limitation regarding the practicality of pre-computed hash tables for cracking passwords?,"A key limitation regarding the practicality of pre-computed hash tables for cracking passwords is their size. If the number of password candidates ('k') is very large, the resulting hash table, which would be of size 'k × n' (where 'n' is the number of bits in each hash), becomes impractically large to store and manage."
Summarize the primary purpose of password salting in cybersecurity.,"The primary purpose of password salting is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes, such as rainbow tables or pre-computed hash tables. By adding a unique 'salt' to each password before it is hashed, salting ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored hash values will be different, thus preventing attackers from using a single pre-computed hash to crack multiple accounts."
Explain how password salting works to enhance security.,"Password salting works by adding a unique, random string, known as a 'salt', to a user's password *before* the hash function is applied. Each password is assigned its own distinct salt. The salt value is then stored alongside the resulting hash of the password+salt combination. This mechanism ensures that even identical passwords will produce different hash values because their unique salts will alter the input to the hash function. Consequently, an attacker attempting to use pre-computed hashes would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password for an n-bit salt, significantly increasing their computational effort and rendering generic pre-computed tables ineffective."
Define what a 'salt' is in the context of password security.,"In the context of password security, a 'salt' is defined as a random string that is added to a password before it is subjected to a hash function. Each password typically has its own unique salt. The salt value is then stored along with the hash of the password combined with the salt (password+salt). Its purpose is to make pre-computed hash attacks, like those using rainbow tables, ineffective by ensuring that identical passwords produce different hash values."
Describe the additional effort required by an attacker when passwords are protected with an n-bit salt.,"When passwords are protected with an n-bit salt, an attacker faces significantly increased effort. For each password they attempt to crack, they would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for that specific password, considering all possible salt values. This effectively negates the efficiency gains of pre-computed hash tables, as the attacker cannot rely on a single pre-computed hash for multiple users or common passwords."
Summarize the essential principle for storing passwords securely.,"The essential principle for storing passwords securely is to do so in a manner that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even in scenarios where the application or database itself has been compromised. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the stored password data, the actual passwords should not be directly recoverable."
What is the inherent challenge defenders face once an attacker acquires stored password hashes?,"Once an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, the inherent challenge defenders face is that the attacker is always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means the attacker can use their own computational resources, without needing to interact with the compromised system, to attempt to crack the passwords at their leisure, making it a persistent threat."
"As a defender, what is the primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks?","As a defender, the primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks is to slow them down as much as possible. This is achieved by carefully selecting hash algorithms that are designed to be resource-intensive. By using computationally expensive hashing functions, the time and resources required for an attacker to brute force hashes offline are significantly increased, making the attack less practical and more costly."

"Explain the relationship between 'c', 'n', and the number of possible passwords as described in Table 10.1.","As described in Table 10.1, 'c' represents the number of character choices available per character position in a password, and 'n' represents the length of the password (number of characters). The total number of possible passwords is calculated as 'c' raised to the power of 'n' (c^n). This formula demonstrates that increasing either the number of character choices or the password length exponentially increases the total number of possible password combinations."
Summarize the relationship between choosing passwords with high entropy and preventing brute-force attacks.,"Choosing passwords with high entropy is a direct and effective measure to prevent brute-force attacks. High entropy means the password has a large number of possible combinations, making it computationally infeasible for an attacker to enumerate all possibilities within a reasonable timeframe. This is typically achieved by using longer passwords and a wider variety of characters (alphabets, numerals, signs)."
"Explain why hashed passwords, especially human-generated ones, are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks despite hashing.","Hashed passwords, particularly those generated by humans, remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks because the underlying weakness exploited is the predictability of human-chosen passwords, not the hashing process itself. Humans tend to select words or common phrases, which can be found in dictionaries. An attacker can pre-compute hashes for these common words and compare them against the stored hashed passwords. Even though the original password is a dictionary word, its hash will match the pre-computed hash of that dictionary word."
Explain the role of 'lg' in the calculation of 'k' for password complexity.,"In the calculation of 'k' for password complexity, where 2^k = c^n, 'lg' refers to the base-2 logarithm. The formula k = [lg(c^n)]/lg2 is used to solve for 'k'. The base-2 logarithm is specifically used because password entropy is measured in 'bits', and each bit represents a binary choice (0 or 1), aligning with the base-2 nature of the calculation. Therefore, 'lg(X)' effectively tells you how many bits are needed to represent 'X' unique possibilities."
Describe the impact of increasing the number of character choices ('c') on the password space.,"Increasing the number of character choices ('c') has a significant exponential impact on the password space. Since the total number of possible passwords is c^n (where 'n' is length), even a small increase in 'c' leads to a vastly larger number of potential password combinations. For example, moving from lowercase (c=26) to lowercase alphanumeric (c=36) for a 5-character password increases the possibilities from 26^5 to 36^5, making it much harder to brute force."
Describe the impact of increasing the password length ('n') on the password space.,"Increasing the password length ('n') has an exponential impact on the password space. Since the total number of possible passwords is c^n (where 'c' is character choices), each additional character added to the password multiplies the total possibilities by 'c'. This exponential growth means that even a small increase in password length dramatically increases the number of combinations an attacker must test, making brute force attacks significantly more difficult and time-consuming."
Why are resource-intensive hash algorithms preferred for password storage?,"Resource-intensive hash algorithms are preferred for password storage because they are designed to be computationally expensive, meaning they require significant processing power and time to compute a hash. This characteristic directly slows down offline attacks, such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, even if an attacker has acquired the stored password hashes. By making each hash calculation costly, the overall time required for an attacker to test a large number of password guesses becomes prohibitively long, thus increasing the security of stored passwords."
Distinguish between the nature of offline and online password attacks based on the provided information.,"The provided information implies a distinction between offline and online password attacks. Online attacks would involve direct interaction with the system, attempting to guess passwords through login forms. In contrast, offline attacks occur after an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, allowing them to brute force these hashes using their own computational resources without further interaction with the target system. The document emphasizes that once hashes are acquired, they can *always* be brute-forced offline, highlighting the persistent threat of such attacks."
Explain the illustration provided for password salting.,"The illustration for password salting depicts the process where an original password, 'hello', has a 'salt' added to it, resulting in 'hello3ab9'. This combined string is then passed through a 'hash function', which produces a unique hash value, such as '39e19b234...'. Finally, both the generated hash and the salt are stored together. This visual representation demonstrates that the salt modifies the input to the hash function, leading to a unique hash even for common passwords, and that the salt itself is stored for verification."
Why is it important for each password to have its own unique salt?,"It is important for each password to have its own unique salt to prevent attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to crack multiple passwords simultaneously. If all passwords shared the same salt, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords combined with that single salt. By ensuring each password has a distinct, random salt, even identical passwords will produce different hash values, forcing the attacker to compute hashes individually for each password-salt combination, significantly increasing their effort."
What is the source of the data presented in Table 10.1?,"The data presented in Table 10.1, which details the bitsize of password space for various character combinations, is sourced from 'Menezes et al. Handbook of Applied Cryptography'."
"Describe the general approach to calculate how long it will take to brute force passwords for a given entry, considering cracker speed.","To calculate how long it will take to brute force passwords for a given entry, one must first determine the total number of possible passwords (c^n) or the complexity (2^k) for that entry. Then, this total number of possibilities is divided by the cracker's speed (e.g., 16 million passwords per second for software crackers). The result will be the estimated time required to exhaust all possible combinations."
Explain the relationship between c^n and 2^k in the context of password complexity.,"In the context of password complexity, c^n represents the absolute total number of unique possible passwords, where 'c' is the number of character choices and 'n' is the password length. The term 2^k is another way to express this same quantity, where 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of c^n. Essentially, 2^k quantifies the password space in terms of 'bits of entropy'. So, 2^k = c^n means that the number of possible passwords (c^n) is equivalent to having 'k' bits of randomness."
Summarize the benefits of using longer passwords in terms of security.,"The benefits of using longer passwords in terms of security are primarily related to increasing the difficulty of brute force attacks. As the password length ('n') increases, the total number of possible password combinations (c^n) grows exponentially. This significantly expands the 'space of possible passwords', making it much more time-consuming and computationally intensive for an attacker to enumerate all potential passwords, thereby enhancing the password's resistance to guessing."
Summarize the benefits of allowing more varieties of symbols in passwords.,"The benefits of allowing more varieties of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs) in passwords are to increase the 'space of possible passwords', which directly enhances resistance to brute force attacks. By increasing the number of character choices ('c') available for each position in a password, the total number of possible combinations (c^n) grows exponentially. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to guess passwords by expanding the pool of characters they must consider, thereby increasing the time and resources required for a successful attack."
