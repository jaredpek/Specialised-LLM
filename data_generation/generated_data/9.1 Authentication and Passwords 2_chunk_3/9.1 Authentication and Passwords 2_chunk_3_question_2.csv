What is a brute force attack against passwords?,"A brute force guessing attack against passwords is a method that attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks whether any of these generated hashes match the target hashes. A hash, or hash value, is a fixed-size string of characters that results from applying a hash function to an input, such as a password. In password security, these hashes are stored and compared to verify passwords without storing the original plaintext passwords."
How can the difficulty of a brute force attack be increased?,"The difficulty of a brute force attack can be increased by expanding the space of possible passwords. This is achieved by using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs. Implementing a robust password policy is an important means to achieve this increased difficulty."
What is password entropy as measured by 2^k?,"Password entropy, when measured by 2^k, refers to the bitsize of the password space. For a password of 'n' characters, where there are 'c' choices per character, the total number of possible passwords is 'c^n'. The value 'k' represents the base-2 logarithm of this number, i.e., k = log2(c^n), indicating the complexity or strength of the password in terms of bits."
Explain the concept of 'bitsize of password space' as presented in Table 10.1.,"The 'bitsize of password space' refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords for a given set of character combinations. If there are 'n' characters in a password and 'c' choices per character, the total number of possible passwords is 'c^n'. The bitsize, denoted as 'k', is calculated as log2(c^n). This value quantifies the complexity or strength of the password space."
What is the number of possible 5-character lowercase passwords?,"For 5-character lowercase passwords, there are 26 possible choices for each character (the lowercase alphabet). Therefore, the total number of such passwords is 26 raised to the power of 5, which is 26^5."
How is the complexity 'k' calculated for a password space of 26^5 possibilities?,"To find the complexity 'k' for a password space of 26^5 possibilities, one must solve the equation 2^k = 26^5. This is achieved by taking the base-2 logarithm of 26^5, resulting in k = [log(26^5)] / log(2), which equals 23.5."
What is a dictionary attack?,"A dictionary attack is a method used to crack hashed passwords, particularly those that are human-generated. It exploits the weakness that human-chosen passwords often derive from words found in natural languages. Instead of enumerating all possible combinations, the attacker guesses commonly used passwords, computes their hash values, and then looks for matches against the stored hash values in a password file."
Why are high entropy passwords not always sufficient to prevent all types of attacks?,"While choosing passwords with high entropy can prevent brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially those generated by humans, remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks. This is because human-chosen passwords often derive from words in natural languages, which a dictionary attack can exploit even if the password has a high theoretical entropy."
Describe the process of a dictionary attack.,"The process of a dictionary attack involves three main steps: First, the attacker guesses some commonly used passwords. Second, they compute the hash values for these guessed passwords. Third, they compare these computed hash values against the hash values stored in the password file, looking for a match."
What is a pre-computed hash table in the context of password cracking?,"A pre-computed hash table is a strategy for cracking hashed passwords. It involves creating a table beforehand that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values. This table can then be used to quickly look up the original password if its hash is known, rather than computing hashes on the fly."
What are the practical considerations for using a pre-computed hash table?,"When using a pre-computed hash table, if there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the resulting table will have a size of 'k x n'. This approach may not be practical if the number of password candidates, 'k', is very large, as it would require an excessively large storage space for the table."
What is password salting?,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that rely on pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, random string, known as a 'salt', to a password *before* applying the hash function. This ensures that even identical passwords will produce different hash values when salted differently."
What is the purpose of adding a salt to a password?,"The purpose of adding a salt to a password is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. By adding a random string (the salt) to the password before hashing, it makes it significantly harder for attackers to use pre-computed tables to crack passwords, as each password will have a unique salted hash."
How is a salt defined in password salting?,"In password salting, a salt is defined simply as a random string that is added to a password before the hash function is applied."
How is the salt value stored in password salting?,The salt value is stored alongside the hash of the password combined with the salt (password+salt). This allows the system to retrieve the correct salt when verifying a password.
What is the impact of salting on an attacker's effort for pre-computation?,"For a salt of 'n' bits, an attacker attempting to use pre-computed hashes would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password. This dramatically increases the computational and storage requirements for the attacker, making pre-computed hash attacks much less feasible."
Why is it essential to store passwords securely?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database where they are stored is compromised. This secure storage is a fundamental defense against unauthorized access."
What happens if an attacker acquires stored password hashes?,"If an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means they can attempt to crack the passwords without needing to interact with the live system, making the attack potentially more efficient and less detectable."
What is a defender's primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks?,"As a defender, the primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks is to slow them down. This is achieved by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible, making the brute-forcing process computationally expensive and time-consuming for the attacker."
What is the cracking speed of software password crackers?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc)."
How quickly can a 3GHz PC crack a password with 2^35 complexity?,"A password with 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day on a 3GHz PC, according to a generous estimate."
How long does it take an FPGA Hardware cracker to crack 56 bits?,"An FPGA Hardware cracker can crack 56 bits within 5 days, according to an estimate."
How do ASIC crackers compare in speed to FPGA crackers?,"ASIC crackers are significantly faster than FPGA crackers, being more than 10 times faster."
What does the 'c' column represent in Table 10.1?,"In Table 10.1, the 'c' column represents the number of choices available per character for a password. For example, '26 (lowercase)' means there are 26 possible lowercase characters to choose from for each position in the password."
What does the 'n' column represent in Table 10.1?,"In Table 10.1, the 'n' column represents the length of the password in characters. For example, '5' under the 'n' column indicates a 5-character password."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 6-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, for a 6-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 31.0."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, for a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 41.7."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 10-character password using keyboard characters?,"According to Table 10.1, for a 10-character password using keyboard characters, the bitsize of the password space is 65.7."
How does increasing password length affect the bitsize of password space for lowercase passwords?,"As shown in Table 10.1 under the '26 (lowercase)' column, increasing the password length ('n') from 5 to 10 characters significantly increases the bitsize of the password space. For example, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5, while a 10-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 47.0, indicating a greater complexity."
How does increasing character variety affect the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password?,"For a 5-character password, increasing the character variety significantly increases the bitsize of the password space. For instance, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5. This increases to 25.9 for lowercase alphanumeric, 29.8 for mixed case alphanumeric, and 32.9 for keyboard characters, demonstrating that more character choices lead to higher entropy."
What is the relationship between the number of possible passwords and the bitsize 'k'?,"The relationship between the number of possible passwords and the bitsize 'k' is logarithmic. If the number of possible passwords is 'c^n', then the bitsize 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of this number, expressed as k = log2(c^n). This means 2^k equals the total number of possible passwords."
What is the significance of a password policy in the context of brute force attacks?,"A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing rules such as minimum length and character variety, it directly contributes to increasing the space of possible passwords, making it harder for attackers to enumerate all combinations."
What is the definition of 'high entropy' in the context of passwords?,"In the context of passwords, 'high entropy' refers to a password that has a large bitsize of password space, meaning there are many possible combinations of characters. This makes it difficult for brute-force attacks to guess the password by enumerating all possibilities."
Why are human-generated passwords particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks?,"Human-generated passwords are particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they tend to derive from words in natural languages. This inherent weakness allows attackers to guess commonly used words and their variations, compute their hashes, and find matches more easily than with truly random passwords."
What is the implication of users having the same password on password file security?,"If multiple users have the same password, they will also have the same hash value stored in the password file. This creates a vulnerability for dictionary attacks, as an attacker only needs to compute the hash for a common password once and can then identify all accounts using that password by looking for matching hash values."
How does pre-computing a hash table aid an attacker?,"Pre-computing a hash table aids an attacker by allowing them to quickly find the original password corresponding to a stolen hash. Instead of performing a real-time computation for each guess, the attacker can simply look up the hash in their pre-computed table, which contains pairs of passwords and their hashes, significantly speeding up the cracking process."
What is an 'offline attack' in the context of password cracking?,An 'offline attack' refers to a password cracking attempt where the attacker has acquired stored password hashes and can then attempt to brute force or crack these hashes without needing to interact with the live system or application. This type of attack is often faster and less detectable than online attacks.
How does password salting make pre-computed hash tables less effective?,"Password salting makes pre-computed hash tables less effective because each password is combined with a unique random string (salt) *before* hashing. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to different salts. Consequently, an attacker cannot use a single pre-computed hash table for all passwords; they would need to pre-compute hashes for every possible password *combined with every possible salt*, which is computationally infeasible."
What is the primary goal of secure password storage?,"The primary goal of secure password storage is to prevent passwords from being obtained by an attacker, even in scenarios where the application or database storing them has been compromised."
What kind of hash algorithms should defenders choose for password storage?,Defenders should choose hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This strategy aims to slow down offline attacks by making the computational effort required to brute force hashes significantly higher.
