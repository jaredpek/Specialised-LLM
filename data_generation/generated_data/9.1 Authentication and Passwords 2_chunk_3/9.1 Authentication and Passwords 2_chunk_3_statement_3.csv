Define the concept of a brute force attack against passwords.,A brute force guessing attack against passwords is a method where an attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks if any of these generated hashes match the target hashes of the compromised system.
What measures can be taken to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"To increase the difficulty of a brute force attack, one can increase the space of possible passwords. This involves using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs. A robust password policy is an important means to implement these measures and increase the difficulties of such attacks."
Explain the role of a password policy in mitigating brute force attacks.,"A password policy plays a crucial role in mitigating brute force attacks by increasing the difficulties an attacker faces. It achieves this by enforcing rules that expand the ""space of possible passwords,"" for example, by requiring longer passwords and encouraging the use of a wider variety of characters, including alphabets, numerals, and signs. This makes it significantly harder for an attacker to enumerate all possible password combinations."
How is password entropy measured according to the provided information?,"Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where 'k' represents the bitsize of the password space. The bitsize 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. The number of possible passwords for an 'n'-character password, given 'c' choices per character, is calculated as c^n. Therefore, k = log2(c^n)."
Describe the components involved in calculating the number of possible passwords for a given character set and length.,"The calculation of the number of possible passwords involves two main components: 'n' and 'c'. 'n' represents the number of characters in the password, which is its length. 'c' represents the number of choices per character, meaning the size of the character set from which each character in the password can be drawn (e.g., 26 for lowercase alphabets, 95 for keyboard characters). The total number of possible passwords is then calculated as c^n."
"Using the provided example, calculate the complexity 'k' for a 5-character lowercase password.","For a 5-character lowercase password, the number of choices per character ('c') is 26 (for lowercase alphabets), and the number of characters ('n') is 5. The total number of possible passwords is 26^5. To find the complexity 'k', which is the bitsize of this password space, we solve the equation 2^k = 26^5. This gives k = [lg(26^5)]/lg2, which equals 23.5."
What is the typical cracking speed of software password crackers on a personal computer?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc)."
Describe the purpose of the program requested in the context of password cracking.,"The requested program is intended to calculate how long it will take to brute-force passwords for each entry listed in the provided table. This calculation would involve using the number of possible passwords (derived from 'c' and 'n' values) and the cracking speed of a software password cracker (e.g., 16 million passwords per second)."
How long would it take to crack a password with 2^35 complexity using a 3GHz PC?,"A password with 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day on a 3GHz PC, based on a generous estimate."
What is the cracking capability of an FPGA hardware cracker in terms of bits and time?,"An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware cracker can crack 56 bits within 5 days, according to an estimate."
How do ASIC crackers compare to FPGA crackers in terms of speed?,"ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster than FPGA crackers, being more than 10 times faster."
Define what a dictionary attack is and what weakness it exploits.,"A dictionary attack is a method used to crack hashed passwords, particularly those that are human-generated. It exploits a weakness in human-chosen passwords, which tend to be derived from words found in natural languages. Instead of enumerating all possible combinations, the attacker guesses commonly used passwords, computes their hash values, and then looks for matches in the password file."
Are passwords with high entropy immune to dictionary attacks? Explain.,"While choosing passwords with high entropy helps prevent brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially those generated by humans, are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks. This is because human-chosen passwords often derive from words in natural languages, which a dictionary attack exploits by guessing common words and their hashes."
Outline the steps an attacker would take to perform a dictionary attack.,"An attacker performing a dictionary attack would follow these steps: First, they would guess some commonly used passwords. Second, they would compute the hash values for these guessed passwords. Third, they would look for the same hash values in the compromised password file to identify matches."
Describe the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking hashed passwords.,The strategy for cracking hashed passwords using a pre-computed hash table involves creating a table that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hashes in advance. An attacker can then use this table to quickly look up the original password if they have a hash value.
Explain how the size of a pre-computed hash table is determined.,"The size of a pre-computed hash table is determined by the number of password candidates ('k') and the bit length of each hash ('n'). If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table will have a size of k \u00d7 n."
What is a practical limitation of pre-computed hash tables?,"A practical limitation of pre-computed hash tables is that they may not be practical if the number of password candidates ('k') is very large. A large 'k' would result in an impractically large table size (k \u00d7 n), making it difficult to store and manage."
What is the primary purpose of password salting?,"The primary purpose of password salting is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes, such as rainbow tables or pre-computed hash tables."
Explain how a salt is applied in the password hashing process.,"In the password hashing process, a salt is a random string that is added to a password *before* applying the hash function. This means the hash function operates on the combined password+salt string, rather than just the password itself."
Describe the key characteristics of a salt used in password salting.,"A salt is characterized as a random string. Crucially, each password should have its own unique salt. The salt value is stored alongside the hash of the password+salt, not separately or in a way that makes it easily guessable."
How does password salting increase the effort required for an attacker?,"Password salting significantly increases the effort required for an attacker. For a salt of 'n' bits, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same password*. This means that instead of pre-computing a single hash for a given password, they must compute a unique hash for every possible salt value combined with that password, effectively negating the efficiency gains of pre-computed tables."
Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker because even if the application or database is compromised, the passwords should remain secure. If an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline, making secure storage a critical first line of defense."
What is always possible once an attacker has acquired stored password hashes?,"Once an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means they can attempt to crack the passwords without needing to interact with the live system, making it a persistent threat."
"As a defender, what is the primary strategy to slow down offline password attacks?","As a defender, the primary strategy to slow down offline password attacks is to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This increases the computational cost and time required for an attacker to brute force the hashes, even offline."
How does increasing password length affect the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"Increasing password length directly increases the difficulty of a brute force attack. A longer password means a larger 'n' (number of characters) in the c^n formula, which exponentially increases the total number of possible password combinations. This expands the ""space of possible passwords,"" making it take significantly longer for an attacker to enumerate all possibilities."
How does allowing more varieties of symbols in passwords affect brute force attack difficulty?,"Allowing more varieties of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs) in passwords increases the 'c' (choices per character) value. This exponentially increases the total number of possible password combinations (c^n), thereby making the password space larger and significantly increasing the difficulty and time required for a brute force attack."
"In the context of password entropy, what does 'c' represent?","In the context of password entropy, 'c' represents the number of choices per character. This refers to the size of the character set from which each character in the password can be selected. For example, 'c' would be 26 for lowercase alphabetic passwords, 36 for lowercase alphanumeric, 62 for mixed case alphanumeric, and 95 for keyboard characters."
"In the context of password entropy, what does 'n' represent?","In the context of password entropy, 'n' represents the number of characters in the password. This is essentially the length of the password."
What does 'k' signify when password entropy is measured by 2^k?,"When password entropy is measured by 2^k, 'k' signifies the bitsize of the password space. It is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords (c^n), indicating the number of bits of entropy the password possesses."
Does choosing passwords with high entropy completely prevent dictionary attacks?,"No, choosing passwords with high entropy does not completely prevent dictionary attacks. While high entropy helps prevent brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially human-generated ones, remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they often derive from natural language words, which dictionary attacks exploit."
Explain why human-generated passwords are particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks.,"Human-generated passwords are particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they tend to derive from words in natural languages. This inherent weakness allows attackers to compile lists of common words and phrases (dictionaries) and test their hashes against stored password hashes, rather than needing to enumerate all possible character combinations."
How does the use of a pre-computed hash table speed up the process of cracking hashed passwords?,"A pre-computed hash table speeds up the process of cracking hashed passwords by eliminating the need to compute hashes on-the-fly during an attack. Instead, an attacker can simply look up a target hash in the pre-computed table to find the corresponding password, which is much faster than performing a hash calculation for every guess."
"Define what a ""hash table"" refers to in the context of cracking hashed passwords.","In the context of cracking hashed passwords, a ""hash table"" refers to a pre-computed data structure that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values. Attackers use this table to quickly find a password by looking up its hash, rather than having to compute hashes during the attack."
"Define what a ""salt"" is in the context of password salting.","In the context of password salting, a ""salt"" is a random string that is added to a password before the hash function is applied. Its purpose is to make each password's hash unique, even if two users have the same password, and to reduce the effectiveness of pre-computed hash attacks."
Where is the salt value stored once it's used in password salting?,"The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This allows the system to retrieve the correct salt when verifying a password, as the salt is needed to re-create the hash for comparison."
How does password salting reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes?,"Password salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes by ensuring that even identical passwords will produce different hashes if they have different salts. This forces an attacker using pre-computed tables to generate a separate table for every possible salt value, or for every unique password+salt combination, which is computationally prohibitive. For an 'n'-bit salt, 2^n hashes would need to be pre-computed for the same password."
Why are resource-intensive hash algorithms recommended for password storage by defenders?,"Resource-intensive hash algorithms are recommended for password storage by defenders because they significantly slow down offline attacks. By making the hashing process computationally expensive, even for legitimate verification, these algorithms increase the time and resources an attacker needs to brute force hashes, thereby slowing down the cracking process."
"Explain what ""offline attacks"" refers to in the context of password security.","In the context of password security, ""offline attacks"" refers to attacks where an adversary has obtained a copy of the hashed passwords (e.g., from a compromised database) and attempts to crack them without needing to interact with the live system or application. This allows the attacker to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks at their own pace and with their own computational resources."
"Based on the provided table, how many possible 6-character lowercase alphanumeric passwords are there, and what is its bitsize complexity?","For a 6-character lowercase alphanumeric password, the number of choices per character ('c') is 36, and the length ('n') is 6. The total number of possible passwords is 36^6. The bitsize complexity ('k') for this is 31.0, as indicated in Table 10.1."
"According to Table 10.1, what is the bitsize complexity for 10-character passwords using keyboard characters?","According to Table 10.1, for 10-character passwords using keyboard characters, the bitsize complexity ('k') is 65.7."
"Compare the bitsize complexity of a 5-character lowercase password versus a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password, based on Table 10.1.","Based on Table 10.1, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize complexity of 23.5. In contrast, a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password has a bitsize complexity of 29.8. This shows that increasing the character set significantly increases complexity even for the same password length."
"What is the source cited for Table 10.1, which details the bitsize of password space?","The source cited for Table 10.1, which details the bitsize of password space, is ""Menezes et al. Handbook of Applied Cryptography."""
What is the implication of a 2^35 complexity password being crackable within a day on a 3GHz PC?,"The implication is that passwords with a complexity of 2^35 bits or less are no longer considered secure against modern computing power, as they can be cracked relatively quickly (within a day) using readily available hardware like a 3GHz PC. This highlights the need for higher entropy passwords."
Why is it important for each password to have its own salt?,"It is important for each password to have its own unique salt because this prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to crack multiple passwords simultaneously. If all passwords shared the same salt, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for that specific salt and crack all passwords at once. Unique salts force the attacker to compute a new hash for each password-salt combination, making the attack much more resource-intensive."
"What is the relationship between 'c', 'n', and the number of possible passwords?","The mathematical relationship between 'c' (choices per character), 'n' (number of characters), and the total number of possible passwords is expressed as c^n. This means that for each of the 'n' character positions, there are 'c' independent choices, leading to an exponential growth in the total number of combinations."
How does a password policy specifically increase the difficulties of a brute force attack?,"A password policy increases the difficulties of a brute force attack by mandating requirements that expand the ""space of possible passwords."" This includes enforcing longer password lengths (increasing 'n') and requiring a wider variety of character types such as alphabets, numerals, and signs (increasing 'c'). Both measures exponentially increase the number of combinations an attacker must try."
What is the main difference in approach between a brute force attack and a dictionary attack?,"The main difference in approach is that a brute force attack systematically tries *all possible* password combinations and their hashes in sequence. In contrast, a dictionary attack exploits human tendencies by guessing *commonly used* passwords, which are typically words or phrases from natural languages, computing their hashes, and checking for matches."
"What is the implication of ""users with same password will have same hash value stored in password file"" for dictionary attacks?","The implication is that if multiple users choose the same password, their stored hash values will be identical (assuming no salting). This makes dictionary attacks more efficient because an attacker only needs to compute the hash for a common password once. If that hash matches a target hash, it could potentially crack multiple user accounts simultaneously if they all used that same common password."
"How does the ""bitsize of password space"" relate to the security of a password?","The ""bitsize of password space,"" represented by 'k' in 2^k, directly relates to the security of a password by quantifying its entropy or complexity. A higher bitsize 'k' indicates a larger number of possible password combinations, making it exponentially more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker to guess or brute-force the password. Therefore, a higher bitsize generally corresponds to a more secure password."
What is the general recommendation for storing passwords to prevent them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised?,"The general recommendation for storing passwords to prevent them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised, is to store them in a way that makes them resistant to offline brute-force attacks. This involves using strong, resource-intensive hash algorithms and employing techniques like salting to slow down any attempts to crack the acquired hashes."
