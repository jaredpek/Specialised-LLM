Analyse the fundamental mechanism of a brute force guessing attack against passwords.,"A brute force guessing attack against passwords operates by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks if any of these generated hashes match the target hashes, thereby attempting to discover the original password. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN)."
What are the primary measures to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"The primary measure to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack is to increase the space of possible passwords. This is achieved by using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, including alphabets, numerals, and signs. A robust password policy is an important means to implement these measures and increase the difficulties associated with such attacks. A password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly."
Explain the role of password policy in mitigating brute force attacks.,"Password policy serves as an important means to increase the difficulties of brute force attacks. By enforcing requirements such as longer passwords and the inclusion of a wider variety of characters (alphabets, numerals, signs), a password policy directly expands the space of possible passwords. This expansion makes it significantly more computationally intensive and time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all potential password combinations, thereby reducing the feasibility of a successful brute force attack. A password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly."
Define password entropy as measured by 2^k and explain its relation to the number of possible passwords.,"Password entropy, measured by 2^k, quantifies the bitsize of the password space for various character combinations. The number of possible n-character passwords, given c choices per character, is calculated as c^n. The value k represents the base-2 logarithm of this number of possible passwords, meaning 2^k = c^n. A higher k value indicates greater entropy, signifying a larger and more complex password space, which makes the password harder to guess. Password entropy is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
Calculate the number of possible passwords for a 5-character lowercase password and determine its complexity in bitsize.,"For a 5-character lowercase password, there are 26 choices per character (alphabets). The number of such passwords is 26^5. To find the complexity of this password in bitsize, denoted as k, one must solve 2^k = 26^5. This calculation yields k = [log2(26^5)] = 23.5. Therefore, there are 26^5 possible passwords, and its complexity is 23.5 bits. Complexity in bitsize refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, indicating the amount of information an attacker would need to guess it."
Analyze the bitsize of password space for a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters.,"For a 7-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 41.7. This value, denoted as k, represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, where c (choices per character) is 62 for mixed case alphanumeric characters and n (number of characters) is 7. The total number of possible passwords would be 62^7, and k = log2(62^7) = 41.7. A higher bitsize indicates a larger and more secure password space. Mixed case alphanumeric characters include both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password versus a 9-character password using keyboard characters.,"For a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password, the bitsize of the password space is 46.5. In contrast, for a 9-character password using keyboard characters, the bitsize is 59.1. This comparison indicates that using keyboard characters, which typically include a wider variety of symbols beyond just lowercase alphanumeric, significantly increases the password space and thus its complexity (bitsize). Lowercase alphanumeric characters include lowercase letters (a-z) and numerals (0-9). Keyboard characters typically encompass a broader set of symbols, including alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs."
"Discuss the cracking capabilities of different hardware for password complexities, specifically for 2^35 complexity.","A password with 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day using a 3GHz PC, based on a generous estimation. For more advanced hardware, a single FPGA hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits within 5 days. ASIC crackers are even more efficient, being more than 10 times faster than FPGA crackers. This demonstrates that specialized hardware significantly accelerates the process of cracking passwords with higher complexities. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or designer after manufacturing. An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is an integrated circuit customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use."
What insights can be derived from the cracking speeds of different hardware types on password entropy?,"Insights derived from cracking speeds reveal that while a standard 3GHz PC can crack 2^35 complexity in about a day, specialized hardware like FPGAs and ASICs offer significantly greater cracking power. An FPGA can crack 56 bits in 5 days, and ASICs are over 10 times faster than FPGAs. This indicates that even seemingly high entropy passwords can be vulnerable to dedicated hardware attacks, emphasizing the need for even greater password complexity or alternative security measures to withstand such advanced cracking capabilities. Password entropy is a measure of the unpredictability of a password, often expressed as the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords."
Explain how the number of choices per character (c) and the number of characters (n) influence the bitsize of the password space.,"The bitsize of the password space is directly influenced by both the number of choices per character (c) and the number of characters (n). The total number of possible passwords is c^n. The bitsize k is the base-2 logarithm of this value, k = log2(c^n). Increasing either c (by allowing more character types like mixed case, numerals, and symbols) or n (by making passwords longer) exponentially increases the total number of possible passwords, and consequently, the bitsize k. A larger k signifies a more complex and secure password space, making it harder to guess. Choices per character (c) refers to the size of the character set from which each character in the password can be drawn. Number of characters (n) refers to the length of the password."
Determine the bitsize of password space for a 6-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters.,"For a 6-character password using lowercase alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 31.0. This value is derived from c=36 (lowercase alphanumeric choices) and n=6 (number of characters), where k = log2(36^6) = 31.0. Lowercase alphanumeric characters include lowercase letters (a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 10-character password composed of keyboard characters?,"For a 10-character password composed of keyboard characters, the bitsize of the password space is 65.7. This value is derived from c=95 (keyboard character choices) and n=10 (number of characters), where k = log2(95^10) = 65.7. Keyboard characters typically encompass a broader set of symbols, including alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs."
Analyze the impact of increasing password length from 5 to 10 characters for lowercase passwords on their bitsize.,"Increasing password length from 5 to 10 characters for lowercase passwords significantly increases their bitsize. A 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5, while a 10-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 47.0. This demonstrates that doubling the password length (from 5 to 10 characters) roughly doubles the bitsize, indicating an exponential increase in the number of possible passwords and thus a substantial improvement in security against brute force attacks. Bitsize represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, quantifying its complexity."
"Describe the general relationship between password length, character set size, and password entropy.","The general relationship between password length (n), character set size (c), and password entropy (k) is that entropy increases exponentially with both length and character set size. The total number of possible passwords is c^n, and the entropy k is the base-2 logarithm of this value (k = log2(c^n)). Therefore, increasing the password length or expanding the set of available characters (e.g., from lowercase to mixed case alphanumeric or keyboard characters) leads to a significantly larger password space and, consequently, higher password entropy, making the password more resistant to guessing attacks. Password entropy is a measure of the unpredictability of a password."
What is the significance of the 'base-2 logarithm' in measuring password entropy?,"The 'base-2 logarithm' is significant in measuring password entropy because it expresses the complexity of the password space in bits. If there are N possible passwords, the entropy k is log2(N). This means that 2^k represents the total number of possible passwords. Using a base-2 logarithm allows for a standardized way to quantify the amount of information or randomness in a password, directly relating it to the number of bits an attacker would need to guess it. Base-2 logarithm is the power to which the number 2 must be raised to obtain the given number."
"Explain why passwords with high entropy, particularly human-generated ones, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks.","While choosing passwords with high entropy generally prevents brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially those that are human-generated, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks. This vulnerability arises because human-chosen passwords tend to derive from words found in natural languages or commonly used phrases. A dictionary attack exploits this weakness by guessing commonly used passwords, computing their hash values, and then looking for matches against the stored hash values in a password file. Even if a password has a high theoretical entropy, if it's a common word or phrase, it can be easily cracked by a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password."
Describe the process of a dictionary attack.,"The process of a dictionary attack involves three main steps. First, the attacker guesses a list of commonly used passwords, which are typically derived from words in natural languages. Second, for each guessed password, the attacker computes its hash value. Third, the attacker compares these computed hash values against the hash values stored in the target password file. If a match is found, the original password is revealed. This attack exploits the tendency of human-chosen passwords to be predictable. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected computer or server by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password."
What is the implication of users having the same password in the context of a dictionary attack?,"The implication of users having the same password in the context of a dictionary attack is that they will have the same hash value stored in the password file. This makes the attack more efficient for the adversary. If an attacker successfully guesses a common password and computes its hash, they can then identify all users who share that same password by simply looking for matching hash values in the password file. This amplifies the impact of a single successful dictionary guess across multiple accounts. A hash value is the output of a hash function, a fixed-size string of characters that uniquely identifies a piece of data."
Contrast the primary weakness exploited by a brute-force attack versus a dictionary attack.,"A brute-force attack primarily exploits the mathematical possibility of enumerating all combinations within a password space, relying on computational power to guess every possible password. Its weakness is the sheer size of the password space. In contrast, a dictionary attack exploits the inherent weakness in human-chosen passwords, which often derive from words in natural languages or commonly used phrases, making them predictable despite potentially having high theoretical entropy. While high entropy prevents brute-force, it doesn't necessarily prevent dictionary attacks if the password is a common word. A brute-force attack attempts every possible combination, whereas a dictionary attack uses a pre-compiled list of common words and phrases."
Analyse the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking hashed passwords.,"The strategy for cracking hashed passwords using a pre-computed hash table involves creating a table that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hashes in advance. This table can then be used in offline attacks to quickly find a password by looking up a target hash. If there are k password candidates and each hash has n bits, the size of such a table would be k \u00d7 n. However, this strategy may not be practical if k (the number of password candidates) is very large, as the storage requirements for the table would become prohibitive. A pre-computed hash table is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a large set of potential passwords, used to speed up password cracking."
What are the practical limitations of a pre-computed hash table strategy for cracking passwords?,"The practical limitation of a pre-computed hash table strategy for cracking passwords primarily revolves around its scalability. If the number of password candidates, denoted as k, is very large, the size of the hash table becomes impractical. For k password candidates and each hash having n bits, the table size would be k \u00d7 n. Storing such an immense amount of data, especially for complex password spaces, would require prohibitive storage resources, making the strategy unfeasible. A pre-computed hash table is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a large set of potential passwords."
Explain the purpose and mechanism of password salting in reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks.,"The purpose of password salting is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. The mechanism involves adding a unique, random string, known as a salt, to a password before applying the hash function. Each password has its own distinct salt, which is a random string. This salt value is then stored alongside the hash of the password+salt combination. Consequently, for an attacker to use pre-computed hashes, they would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password for each possible salt value (where n is the bit length of the salt), making the use of generic pre-computed tables like rainbow tables ineffective. A salt is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase."
Describe the key properties of a salt in the context of password salting.,"In the context of password salting, a salt possesses several key properties. Firstly, a salt is simply a random string. Secondly, each password should have its own unique salt. Thirdly, the salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt combination. These properties ensure that even if two users have the same password, their stored hash values will be different because their unique salts will result in different inputs to the hash function. A salt is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase."
How does password salting specifically counter the use of pre-computed hashes by an attacker?,"Password salting specifically counters the use of pre-computed hashes by an attacker by making it computationally infeasible to use generic pre-computed tables. When a salt is added to a password before hashing, the attacker cannot simply use a pre-computed table of common password hashes. Instead, for a salt of n bits, the attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password for every possible salt value. Since each password has its own unique salt, this effectively means an attacker would need to generate a unique pre-computed table for every possible salt-password combination, which is an astronomically large and impractical task. A salt is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase. Pre-computed hashes are hash values calculated in advance and stored in a table for faster lookup during an attack."
What is the fundamental principle for storing passwords securely?,"The fundamental principle for storing passwords securely is to ensure they are stored in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database storing them is compromised. This means that raw passwords should never be stored directly. Instead, they should be hashed, and ideally, salted and hashed, to protect them from various offline attacks. Password storage refers to the methods and practices used to keep user passwords safe and confidential."
Analyse the challenge defenders face once an attacker acquires stored password hashes.,"Once an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, defenders face the significant challenge that the attacker is always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means the attacker can take their time, using powerful computing resources without detection, to try and crack the original passwords from the hashes. As a defender, it is only possible to slow down these offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible, making the cracking process more time-consuming and costly for the attacker. Offline attacks are attacks where an adversary obtains a copy of the hashed passwords and attempts to crack them without direct interaction with the system."
What is the primary defensive strategy to mitigate offline attacks on acquired password hashes?,"The primary defensive strategy to mitigate offline attacks on acquired password hashes is to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This approach aims to slow down the attacker's ability to brute force the hashes offline. By using algorithms that require significant computational power, memory, or time, the cost and time required for an attacker to crack passwords from their hashes are substantially increased, making the attack less feasible. Resource-intensive hash algorithms are cryptographic hash functions designed to be computationally expensive, thereby increasing the time and resources required for an attacker to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks on hashed passwords."
"Compare and contrast brute force attacks and dictionary attacks, highlighting their target weaknesses.","Brute force attacks attempt to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence, targeting the entire password space. Their effectiveness is countered by increasing password length and character variety (high entropy). Dictionary attacks, on the other hand, exploit the weakness in human-chosen passwords, which often derive from natural language words. They work by guessing commonly used passwords, computing their hashes, and checking for matches. While high entropy prevents brute force, it doesn't necessarily prevent dictionary attacks if the password is a common word. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method to guess passwords, while a dictionary attack uses a pre-compiled list of common words and phrases."
How does increasing the variety of symbols in a password contribute to its security against brute force attacks?,"Increasing the variety of symbols in a password contributes to its security against brute force attacks by expanding the 'choices per character' (c) in the password space. For example, moving from lowercase letters only (26 choices) to mixed case alphanumeric characters (62 choices) or full keyboard characters (95 choices) significantly increases the base of the c^n calculation. This exponential growth in the number of possible passwords makes it much harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all combinations, thereby increasing the password's resistance to brute force guessing. Variety of symbols refers to the range of character types available for password creation, including alphabets, numerals, and special signs."
Discuss the implications of software password crackers being able to crack 16 million passwords per second per PC.,"The ability of software password crackers to crack up to 16 million passwords per second per PC has significant implications for password security. It means that passwords with lower entropy can be compromised very quickly. This high cracking speed necessitates the use of strong password policies that enforce long, complex passwords with high entropy to ensure that the time required to brute force even a single password becomes prohibitively long, even with such efficient cracking tools. Software password crackers are programs designed to recover passwords from data that has been stored or transmitted by a computer system."
What is the estimated time to crack a password with 56 bits of complexity using an FPGA Hardware cracker?,"An FPGA Hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits of complexity within 5 days. This provides a benchmark for the performance of specialized hardware in password cracking, indicating that even moderately complex passwords can be compromised relatively quickly by dedicated hardware. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or designer after manufacturing."
How much faster are ASIC crackers compared to FPGA hardware crackers?,"ASIC crackers are more than 10 times faster than FPGA hardware crackers. This significant speed advantage highlights the superior performance of application-specific integrated circuits in password cracking tasks, making them a formidable threat against even high-entropy passwords. An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is an integrated circuit customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use."
Explain why human-generated passwords are particularly susceptible to dictionary attacks.,"Human-generated passwords are particularly susceptible to dictionary attacks because they tend to derive from words in natural languages, common phrases, or easily guessable patterns. Unlike truly random strings, humans often choose passwords that are memorable, which inadvertently makes them predictable and present in dictionaries or lists of common passwords. This inherent predictability allows attackers to efficiently guess and hash these common words, then compare them against stored password hashes. A dictionary attack exploits this weakness by using a pre-compiled list of common words and phrases."
"What is the primary goal of a defender in the context of password storage, given that offline brute-force attacks are always possible?","Given that an attacker can always brute force hashes offline once acquired, the primary goal of a defender in the context of password storage is to slow down these offline attacks as much as possible. This is achieved by selecting hash algorithms that are resource-intensive, making the cracking process computationally expensive and time-consuming for the attacker, thereby increasing the window of opportunity for detection or rendering the attack impractical. Offline attacks are attacks where an adversary obtains a copy of the hashed passwords and attempts to crack them without direct interaction with the system."
Describe the process of calculating the bitsize of password space for any given character set and password length.,"The process of calculating the bitsize of password space for any given character set and password length involves two steps. First, determine the total number of possible passwords, which is c^n, where c is the number of choices per character (the size of the character set) and n is the number of characters (the password length). Second, calculate the base-2 logarithm of this total number of possible passwords. This result, k = log2(c^n), represents the bitsize of the password space. Bitsize of password space quantifies the entropy or complexity of a password in terms of bits."
How does password salting prevent two users with the same password from having identical stored hash values?,"Password salting prevents two users with the same password from having identical stored hash values because each password is combined with its own unique, random salt before the hashing function is applied. Even if two users choose the exact same password, their distinct salts will result in different inputs to the hash function (password+salt1 vs. password+salt2), leading to entirely different hash outputs. These unique hash(password+salt) values are then stored along with their respective salts, ensuring that identical passwords do not produce identical stored hashes. A salt is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase."
"What is the consequence of not using salting when storing hashed passwords, especially in the context of pre-computed hash tables?","The consequence of not using salting when storing hashed passwords is that it makes the system highly vulnerable to attacks using pre-computed hash tables, such as rainbow tables. Without a unique salt for each password, identical passwords will produce identical hash values. An attacker can then pre-compute a large table of common password hashes and quickly find matches for any acquired password hashes, compromising multiple accounts simultaneously if they share common passwords. Salting prevents this by ensuring unique hashes even for identical passwords. A pre-computed hash table is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a large set of potential passwords."
Analyse the security implications of storing the salt value along with the hash of password+salt.,"Storing the salt value along with the hash of password+salt is a crucial part of password salting and has positive security implications. The salt is not a secret; its purpose is to ensure that even identical passwords produce unique hashes. By storing the salt openly with the hash, the system can correctly verify a user's password by combining the entered password with the stored salt, then hashing it and comparing the result to the stored hash. This design ensures that an attacker cannot use generic pre-computed hash tables, as they would need to know the specific salt for each hash to generate the correct input for comparison. A salt is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase."
What is the minimum password length recommended by the document's data to achieve a bitsize greater than 50 for lowercase alphanumeric characters?,"To achieve a bitsize greater than 50 for lowercase alphanumeric characters, the minimum password length recommended by the document's data is 10 characters. A 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password has a bitsize of 46.5, while a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password has a bitsize of 51.7, which is greater than 50. Bitsize represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, quantifying its complexity."
How does the concept of 'resource-intensive hash algorithms' contribute to slowing down offline attacks?,"The concept of 'resource-intensive hash algorithms' contributes to slowing down offline attacks by making the process of computing hashes computationally expensive. These algorithms are designed to require significant CPU time, memory, or both, for each hash calculation. When an attacker attempts to brute force or dictionary attack a large number of acquired hashes offline, each attempt takes a considerable amount of time and resources. This increased cost per hash significantly extends the overall time required for a successful attack, making it less practical and more detectable, thereby slowing down the attacker's progress. Resource-intensive hash algorithms are cryptographic hash functions designed to be computationally expensive."
What is the primary vulnerability that a pre-computed hash table attack exploits?,"A pre-computed hash table attack primarily exploits the vulnerability that identical passwords produce identical hash values when no salting is used. By pre-calculating and storing a vast number of password-hash pairs, an attacker can quickly look up a compromised hash in their table to find the corresponding password, especially if many users share common passwords. This attack bypasses the need for real-time hashing during the cracking process. A pre-computed hash table is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a large set of potential passwords."
Discuss the importance of storing passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained even if the database is compromised.,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. This is critical because a database compromise is a common attack vector. If passwords are stored in plain text or easily reversible formats, a breach immediately exposes all user credentials. By storing only strong hashes (ideally salted and resource-intensively hashed), even a compromised database will only yield hashes, which still require significant computational effort to crack offline, thus protecting the original passwords. Database compromise refers to unauthorized access to or breach of a database, potentially exposing sensitive information."
What is the bitsize of password space for an 8-character password using keyboard characters?,"For an 8-character password using keyboard characters, the bitsize of the password space is 52.6. This value is derived from c=95 (keyboard character choices) and n=8 (number of characters), where k = log2(95^8) = 52.6. Keyboard characters typically encompass a broad set of symbols, including alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs."
Analyze the impact of using lowercase alphanumeric characters versus mixed case alphanumeric characters for a 7-character password on its bitsize.,"Using mixed case alphanumeric characters significantly increases the bitsize of a 7-character password compared to using only lowercase alphanumeric characters. For a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password, the bitsize is 36.2. However, for a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password, the bitsize increases to 41.7. This demonstrates that expanding the character set from 36 (lowercase alphanumeric) to 62 (mixed case alphanumeric) substantially enhances the password's entropy and resistance to attacks. Lowercase alphanumeric characters include lowercase letters (a-z) and numerals (0-9). Mixed case alphanumeric characters include both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
What is the estimated cracking time for a 2^35 complexity password on a 3GHz PC?,"A password with 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day on a 3GHz PC, based on a generous estimation. This indicates the speed at which common computing hardware can compromise passwords with moderate entropy. Complexity in this context refers to the bitsize of the password space, where 2^35 represents the total number of possible passwords."
How does the c^n formula relate to the concept of password space?,"The c^n formula directly calculates the total number of possible passwords, which defines the password space. Here, c represents the number of choices per character (the size of the character set), and n represents the number of characters (the password length). For example, if there are 26 lowercase letters (c=26) and a password is 5 characters long (n=5), then there are 26^5 possible passwords. This formula is fundamental to understanding the size and complexity of the set of all possible passwords an attacker might try to guess. Password space refers to the total number of unique passwords that can be generated given a specific set of rules (character set and length)."
What is the primary benefit of increasing the space of possible passwords as a measure against brute force attacks?,"The primary benefit of increasing the space of possible passwords as a measure against brute force attacks is that it makes the attack computationally infeasible or prohibitively time-consuming. By expanding the number of possible combinations (e.g., through longer passwords and more diverse character sets), the attacker needs to perform a vastly greater number of guesses to find the correct password. This exponential increase in the search space significantly reduces the likelihood of a successful brute force attack within a practical timeframe. Password space refers to the total number of unique passwords that can be generated given a specific set of rules (character set and length)."
Explain the concept of 'target hashes' in the context of a brute force attack.,"In the context of a brute force attack, 'target hashes' refer to the hashed representations of the actual passwords that an attacker is trying to discover. When an attacker enumerates possible passwords and computes their hashes, these computed hashes are then compared against the 'target hashes' obtained from a compromised system (e.g., a password file). A match between a computed hash and a target hash indicates that the attacker has successfully found the original password corresponding to that target hash. A hash is a fixed-size string of characters that uniquely identifies a piece of data, generated by a one-way hash function."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 5-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For a 5-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 29.8. This value is derived from c=62 (mixed case alphanumeric choices) and n=5 (number of characters), where k = log2(62^5) = 29.8. Mixed case alphanumeric characters include both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
Summarize the core idea behind the 'Password Storage Cheat Sheet' introduction.,"The core idea behind the 'Password Storage Cheat Sheet' introduction is that secure password storage is paramount, even in the event of a system compromise. It emphasizes that passwords must be stored in a manner that prevents their direct acquisition by an attacker. Acknowledging that attackers can always brute force acquired hashes offline, the introduction highlights that the defender's best strategy is to slow down these offline attacks by employing hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This approach aims to make the cracking process impractical for adversaries. Password storage refers to the methods and practices used to keep user passwords safe and confidential."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 6-character password using keyboard characters?,"For a 6-character password using keyboard characters, the bitsize of the password space is 39.4. This value is derived from c=95 (keyboard character choices) and n=6 (number of characters), where k = log2(95^6) = 39.4. Keyboard characters typically encompass a broad set of symbols, including alphabets (uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs."
How does the 'add salt' step in password salting modify the input to the hash function?,"In password salting, the 'add salt' step modifies the input to the hash function by concatenating a random string (the salt) with the original password. Instead of hashing just the password, the hash function receives 'password+salt' as its input. This ensures that even if the same password is used by multiple users, or if an attacker tries to hash a common password, the unique salt associated with each password will result in a different input to the hash function, leading to a unique hash output. A salt is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase."
What is the bitsize of password space for an 8-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"For an 8-character lowercase alphanumeric password, the bitsize of the password space is 41.4. This value is derived from c=36 (lowercase alphanumeric choices) and n=8 (number of characters), where k = log2(36^8) = 41.4. Lowercase alphanumeric characters include lowercase letters (a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
Explain the concept of 'enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence' in a brute force attack.,"In a brute force attack, 'enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence' refers to the systematic generation of every possible password combination, one after another, and for each generated password, computing its corresponding hash value. This process starts from the simplest possible password and incrementally builds up to more complex ones, covering the entire defined password space. Each generated password's hash is then compared against the target hashes to find a match. This sequential trial-and-error is the core mechanism of a brute force attack."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 9-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For a 9-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 53.6. This value is derived from c=62 (mixed case alphanumeric choices) and n=9 (number of characters), where k = log2(62^9) = 53.6. Mixed case alphanumeric characters include both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
How does the impracticality of a large 'k' affect the pre-computed hash table strategy?,"The impracticality of a large 'k' (number of password candidates) severely affects the pre-computed hash table strategy by making the storage requirements for the table prohibitive. If k is large, the table size, calculated as k \u00d7 n (where n is the hash bit length), becomes too vast to store efficiently. This means that for highly complex password spaces, generating and storing a comprehensive pre-computed hash table is not a feasible approach for cracking passwords, limiting the effectiveness of this strategy to less complex password sets. A pre-computed hash table is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a large set of potential passwords."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"For a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password, the bitsize of the password space is 36.2. This value is derived from c=36 (lowercase alphanumeric choices) and n=7 (number of characters), where k = log2(36^7) = 36.2. Lowercase alphanumeric characters include lowercase letters (a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application is compromised?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application is compromised because the application layer is a common point of vulnerability. If an attacker gains access to the application, they might be able to bypass front-end security measures. If passwords are not securely stored (e.g., are in plain text or weakly hashed), a compromise at the application level could immediately expose all user credentials, leading to widespread account takeovers. Secure storage, such as strong salting and hashing, ensures that even a compromised application cannot easily reveal original passwords."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"For a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password, the bitsize of the password space is 51.7. This value is derived from c=36 (lowercase alphanumeric choices) and n=10 (number of characters), where k = log2(36^10) = 51.7. Lowercase alphanumeric characters include lowercase letters (a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
How does the vulnerability of human-chosen passwords to dictionary attacks differ from their vulnerability to brute-force attacks?,"The vulnerability of human-chosen passwords to dictionary attacks differs from their vulnerability to brute-force attacks in the nature of the exploited weakness. Human-chosen passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they often consist of common words, phrases, or predictable patterns found in natural languages, making them guessable from a pre-compiled list. In contrast, their vulnerability to brute-force attacks is related to their overall entropy or complexity. While a human-chosen password might have high theoretical entropy (making brute-force difficult), if it's a common word, it remains susceptible to a dictionary attack. Dictionary attacks leverage predictability, whereas brute-force attacks leverage computational power against the entire search space."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 6-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters?,"For a 6-character password using mixed case alphanumeric characters, the bitsize of the password space is 35.7. This value is derived from c=62 (mixed case alphanumeric choices) and n=6 (number of characters), where k = log2(62^6) = 35.7. Mixed case alphanumeric characters include both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and numerals (0-9)."
