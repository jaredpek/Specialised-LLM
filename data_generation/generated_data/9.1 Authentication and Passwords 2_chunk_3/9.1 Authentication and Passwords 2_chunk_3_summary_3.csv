Provide a comprehensive summary of a brute force attack.,"A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that tries to guess a password by enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence, and checking whether they match the target hashes. This process involves systematically attempting every possible password combination until a match is found."
Summarise the key measures to defend against brute force attacks.,"Key measures against a ""brute force attack"" involve increasing the ""space of possible passwords"". The ""space of possible passwords"" refers to the total number of unique password combinations an attacker would need to try. This can be achieved by using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs. A robust ""password policy"", which is a set of rules designed to enhance password security, is an important means to increase the difficulty of such attacks."
Can you summarise the key considerations behind password policy in the context of brute force attacks?,"A ""password policy"" is an important means to increase the difficulties of a ""brute force attack"". A ""password policy"" is a set of rules designed to enhance password security, often dictating minimum length, character complexity, and expiration. A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. By enforcing rules such as minimum length and requiring a variety of character types (alphabets, numerals, signs), a password policy effectively increases the ""space of possible passwords"", which refers to the total number of unique password combinations an attacker would need to try, making it significantly harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all combinations."
"Explain how password entropy is measured using the ""2^k"" notation.","""Password entropy"" is measured by ""2^k"", where 'k' represents the ""bitsize of the password space"". ""Password entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password, indicating how difficult it is to guess or crack. The ""bitsize of the password space (k)"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. For 'n'-character passwords with 'c' choices per character, the total number of possible passwords is 'c^n'. Therefore, 'k' is calculated as log₂(c^n). A higher 'k' value indicates greater entropy and thus a more secure password."
How is the number of possible passwords calculated given character choices and length?,"The number of possible passwords for an ""n-character password"", which is a password composed of 'n' individual characters, given ""c choices per character"", which is the total number of distinct characters that can be used at each position, is calculated as 'c^n'."
Describe how to determine the complexity or bitsize 'k' of a password.,"To determine the ""complexity"" or ""bitsize 'k'"" of a password, one must solve the equation 2^k = (number of possible passwords). ""Complexity (k)"" in this context refers to the bitsize of the password space, indicating the computational effort required to brute-force it. The ""bitsize 'k'"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. For example, if there are 'c' choices per character and the password is 'n' characters long, the total number of possible passwords is 'c^n', and 'k' would be log₂(c^n)."
Provide an example calculation for the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase password.,"For a 5-character lowercase password, there are 26 possible choices per character (c=26) and the length is 5 characters (n=5). The total number of such passwords is 26^5. To find the ""complexity"" or ""bitsize 'k'"", we solve 2^k = 26^5. ""Complexity (k)"" refers to the bitsize of the password space, indicating the computational effort required to brute-force it. The ""bitsize 'k'"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. This calculation yields k = [log(26^5)] / log(2) = 23.5."
What is the typical cracking speed of software password crackers?,"At present, ""software password crackers"" can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc). ""Software password crackers"" are programs designed to guess or discover passwords by systematically trying combinations, often running on general-purpose computing hardware."
How quickly can an FPGA hardware cracker crack passwords?,"An ""FPGA Hardware cracker"" can crack 56 bits of password complexity within 5 days, based on an estimate. An ""FPGA Hardware cracker"" is a password cracking device that utilizes Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which are reconfigurable integrated circuits that can be programmed to perform specific computational tasks, often offering performance advantages over general-purpose CPUs for tasks like password hashing."
Compare the speed of ASIC crackers to FPGA crackers.,"""ASIC crackers"" can be more than 10 times faster than ""FPGA Hardware crackers"". ""ASIC crackers"" are password cracking devices that use Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom-designed chips optimized for a particular task. ""FPGA Hardware crackers"" are password cracking devices that utilize Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which are reconfigurable integrated circuits."
Define what a dictionary attack is.,"A ""dictionary attack"" is a type of password attack that exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which tend to derive from words in natural languages. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns (a ""dictionary"") to guess passwords, rather than systematically trying all possible character combinations."
"Why are hashed passwords, even with high entropy, still vulnerable to dictionary attacks?","While choosing passwords with ""high entropy"" can prevent ""brute-force attacks"", ""hashed passwords"", especially those that are human-generated, are still vulnerable to ""dictionary attacks"". ""High entropy"" refers to a state of high randomness and unpredictability in a password, making it difficult to guess. ""Brute-force attacks"" are guessing attacks against passwords that attempt to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. ""Hashed passwords"" are passwords that have been transformed into a fixed-size string of characters (a hash value) using a cryptographic hash function. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. This is because human-chosen passwords often derive from words in natural languages or common patterns, which a dictionary attack specifically exploits."
Describe the steps involved in a dictionary attack.,"The mechanism of a ""dictionary attack"" involves three main steps: 1. Guessing some commonly used passwords. 2. Computing the ""hash values"" of these guessed passwords. ""Hash values"" are the fixed-size output of a cryptographic hash function, unique to the input data. 3. Looking for the same hash values in the password file that contains stored password hashes. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords."
What is a pre-computed hash table in the context of password cracking?,"A ""pre-computed hash table"" is a strategy for cracking ""hashed passwords"" that involves creating a table containing pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values in advance. A ""pre-computed hash table"" is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a vast number of potential passwords, along with their corresponding plaintext passwords. ""Hashed passwords"" are passwords that have been transformed into a fixed-size string of characters (a hash value) using a cryptographic hash function. This table can then be used to quickly look up the original password if its hash is known."
What is the primary purpose of using a pre-computed hash table in password attacks?,"The primary purpose of using a ""pre-computed hash table"" in password attacks is to crack ""hashed passwords"" more efficiently. A ""pre-computed hash table"" is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a vast number of potential passwords, along with their corresponding plaintext passwords. ""Hashed passwords"" are passwords that have been transformed into a fixed-size string of characters (a hash value) using a cryptographic hash function. By having a table of password-hash pairs already computed, an attacker can avoid the time-consuming process of computing hashes for each guess during an attack, instead performing a quick lookup."
What are the practical limitations or issues with pre-computed hash tables?,"The main practical limitation of a ""pre-computed hash table"" is its size. A ""pre-computed hash table"" is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a vast number of potential passwords. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table would be of size 'k × n'. This may not be practical if 'k' (the number of password candidates) is very large, as it would require immense storage capacity."
Define password salting.,"""Password salting"" is a security measure where a ""salt"" (a random string) is added to a password before applying a ""hash function"". ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. A ""salt"" is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase. A ""hash function"" is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (e.g., a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, typically used for data integrity and security. This process creates a unique hash for each password, even if two users have the same original password."
What is the main purpose of password salting?,"The main purpose of ""password salting"" is to reduce the effectiveness of ""offline attacks"" that use ""pre-computed hashes"". ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. ""Offline attacks"" are password cracking attempts performed by an attacker on their own system, using a stolen database of hashed passwords. ""Pre-computed hashes"" are hash values calculated in advance for a large number of potential passwords, typically stored in a ""pre-computed hash table"". By adding a unique ""salt"" to each password before hashing, it prevents attackers from using a single pre-computed hash table to crack multiple passwords or to quickly identify common passwords."
Explain the process of how password salting works.,"""Password salting"" works by adding a ""salt"" (a random string) to a password *before* applying the ""hash function"". ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. A ""salt"" is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase. A ""hash function"" is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input into a fixed-size string of characters. Each password has its own unique salt. The ""salt value"" is then stored along with the hash of the ""password+salt"" combination. The ""salt value"" is the specific random string used as a salt for a particular password, and ""password+salt"" refers to the concatenation of the plaintext password and its unique salt, which is then fed into the hash function. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored hash values will be different due to the unique salt."
What are the key properties of a salt used in password salting?,"The key properties of a ""salt"" used in ""password salting"" are: A ""salt"" is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase. ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed.\n1. A salt is just a ""random string"", meaning a sequence of characters generated unpredictably.\n2. Each password has its ""own salt"", implying that salts are unique per password, even if the original passwords are identical.\n3. The ""salt value"" is stored along with the hash of the ""password+salt"" combination. The ""salt value"" is the specific random string used as a salt for a particular password, and ""password+salt"" is the concatenation of the plaintext password and its unique salt, which is then fed into the hash function."
How does password salting increase the effort required for an attacker using pre-computed hashes?,"""Password salting"" significantly increases the effort for an attacker using ""pre-computed hashes"". ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. ""Pre-computed hashes"" are hash values calculated in advance for a large number of potential passwords, typically stored in a ""pre-computed hash table"". For a ""salt of 'n' bits"", which means a salt that has 'n' bits of randomness (2^n possible unique salt values), the attacker needs to ""pre-compute 2^n hashes"" for the *same password*. This means that instead of computing a hash once for a given password and using it to crack all instances of that password, the attacker must compute a unique hash for every possible salt value for each password they want to crack, effectively negating the efficiency gains of pre-computation."
Why is it essential to store passwords securely?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database itself is compromised. This is because once an attacker has acquired stored ""password hashes"", which are the output of a cryptographic hash function applied to a password, they are always able to ""brute force hashes offline"". ""Brute force hashes offline"" is the process of an attacker attempting to guess passwords by systematically trying combinations against stolen hash values on their own system, without needing to interact with the live system. This makes secure storage a critical first line of defense."
Describe the nature of offline brute force attacks once password hashes are acquired.,"After an attacker has acquired stored ""password hashes"", they are always able to ""brute force hashes offline"". ""Password hashes"" are the output of a cryptographic hash function applied to a password, stored instead of the plaintext password. ""Brute force hashes offline"" is the process of an attacker attempting to guess passwords by systematically trying combinations against stolen hash values on their own system, without needing to interact with the live system. This makes it a persistent threat, as the attacker has unlimited time and computational resources to try combinations against the stolen hashes."
What is a defender's primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks?,"As a defender, the primary strategy to mitigate ""offline attacks"" is to slow them down as much as possible. ""Offline attacks"" are password cracking attempts performed by an attacker on their own system, using a stolen database of hashed passwords. This is achieved by selecting ""hash algorithms"" that are as ""resource intensive"" as possible. ""Hash algorithms"" are mathematical functions used to transform data into a fixed-size string, specifically designed for password hashing. ""Resource intensive"" algorithms are those that require significant computational resources (CPU, memory, time) to execute, thereby increasing the time and cost for an attacker to brute force passwords offline."
How does increasing password length affect password entropy?,"Increasing ""password length"" directly increases ""password entropy"". ""Password length"" refers to the number of characters in a password. ""Password entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. As the length ('n' in 'c^n') grows, the total number of possible passwords ('c^n') increases exponentially, which in turn increases the ""bitsize 'k'"" (log₂(c^n)), making the password significantly harder to guess or crack. The ""bitsize 'k'"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy."
How does increasing character variety affect password entropy?,"Increasing ""character variety"" directly increases ""password entropy"". ""Character variety"" refers to the number of unique characters available for selection at each position in a password (e.g., 26 for lowercase, 62 for mixed case alphanumeric). ""Password entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. A larger 'c' value (number of choices per character) means more possible characters can be used at each position, leading to an exponential increase in the total number of possible passwords ('c^n') and consequently a higher ""bitsize 'k'"" (log₂(c^n)), making the password more robust against attacks. The ""bitsize 'k'"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy."
Compare the password entropy for different character sets based on the provided table.,"Based on the provided table, ""password entropy"" significantly increases with a wider ""character set"". ""Password entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. A ""character set"" is the collection of all possible characters that can be used in a password. For a 10-character password:\n*   Using only ""lowercase"" characters (26 choices) yields 47.0 ""bits of entropy"".\n*   Using ""lowercase alphanumeric"" characters (36 choices) yields 51.7 ""bits of entropy"".\n*   Using ""mixed case alphanumeric"" characters (62 choices) yields 59.5 ""bits of entropy"".\n*   Using ""keyboard characters"" (95 choices) yields 65.7 ""bits of entropy"".\n""Bits of entropy"" refers to the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, indicating the strength of the password. This demonstrates that expanding the pool of available characters (c) for a given password length (n) substantially enhances security by increasing the bitsize of the password space."
What are the primary methods to increase the difficulty of brute force attacks?,"The primary methods to increase the difficulty of ""brute force attacks"" involve increasing the ""space of possible passwords"". A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence. The ""space of possible passwords"" refers to the total number of unique password combinations that an attacker would need to try. This can be achieved by:\n1.  Using ""longer passwords"" (increasing 'n'), which are passwords with a greater number of characters.\n2.  Allowing ""more varieties of symbols"" (alphabets, numerals, signs), which increases 'c' (choices per character), meaning including different types of characters such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.\n3.  Implementing a strong ""password policy"" that enforces these requirements. A ""password policy"" is a set of rules designed to enhance password security."
Why are human-generated passwords particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks?,"Human-generated passwords are particularly vulnerable to ""dictionary attacks"" because they tend to derive from words in natural languages. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. People often choose memorable words, names, or simple patterns, which are easily compiled into dictionaries that attackers use. This inherent predictability allows dictionary attacks to succeed even against hashed passwords that might otherwise appear complex."
"In the context of password cracking, what is a hash?","In the context of password cracking, a ""hash"" refers to the fixed-size output generated by a ""hash function"" when a password is input. A ""hash function"" is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (e.g., a password) into a fixed-size string of characters. Instead of storing plaintext passwords, systems store these ""hash values"". Attackers attempt to guess passwords by generating hashes of their guesses and comparing them to the ""target hashes"" obtained from a compromised system. ""Target hashes"" are the stolen hash values of legitimate user passwords that an attacker is trying to match."
"What is the significance of ""2^k"" in measuring password entropy?","The ""2^k"" notation is significant in measuring ""password entropy"" because 'k' represents the ""bitsize of the password space"", which is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. ""Password entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. The ""bitsize of the password space (k)"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. Therefore, 2^k directly quantifies the total number of unique password combinations an attacker would theoretically need to try in a brute-force scenario. A higher 'k' (and thus a larger 2^k) indicates a more secure password."
"Explain the concept of ""c choices per character"" in password entropy.","In ""password entropy"" calculations, ""c choices per character"" refers to the number of distinct characters available for selection at each position within a password. ""Password entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. For example, if only lowercase alphabets are allowed, 'c' would be 26. If lowercase, uppercase, and numbers are allowed, 'c' would be 26 (lowercase) + 26 (uppercase) + 10 (numbers) = 62. A larger 'c' value significantly increases the total number of possible passwords for a given length, thereby boosting entropy."
Describe the relationship between 'c' and 'n' in determining password complexity.,"In determining ""password complexity"", 'c' represents the ""number of choices per character"" and 'n' represents the ""password length"" (number of characters). ""Password complexity"" is a measure of how difficult a password is to guess or crack, often quantified by its entropy or bitsize. The ""number of choices per character (c)"" is the size of the character set available for each position in the password. The ""password length (n)"" is the total number of characters in the password. The total number of possible passwords is calculated as 'c^n'. Both 'c' and 'n' have an exponential relationship with complexity: increasing either 'c' or 'n' dramatically increases the total password space, and thus the ""bitsize 'k'"" (log₂(c^n)), making the password much harder to crack. The ""bitsize 'k'"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy."
What are the primary limitations of using pre-computed hash tables for password cracking?,"The primary limitation of using ""pre-computed hash tables"" for password cracking is their immense storage requirement. A ""pre-computed hash table"" is a data structure that stores pre-calculated hash values for a vast number of potential passwords, along with their corresponding plaintext passwords. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table size would be 'k × n'. This becomes impractical when 'k' (the number of password candidates) is very large, as the storage needed for such a table would be prohibitive."
How does adding a salt reduce the effectiveness of pre-computed hashes?,"Adding a ""salt"" reduces the effectiveness of ""pre-computed hashes"" by making each password's hash unique, even if the original passwords are the same. A ""salt"" is a random string of data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase. ""Pre-computed hashes"" are hash values calculated in advance for a large number of potential passwords, typically stored in a ""pre-computed hash table"". Since the salt is a random string added *before* hashing, an attacker cannot use a single pre-computed hash table. Instead, for a ""salt of 'n' bits"", which is a salt that has 'n' bits of randomness (2^n possible unique salt values), the attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for *each* password they target, effectively requiring a separate, massive pre-computation for every unique salt-password combination, which is computationally infeasible."
What information is stored along with a salted password's hash?,"When ""password salting"" is implemented, the ""salt value"" itself is stored along with the ""hash of the password+salt"" combination. ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. The ""salt value"" is the specific random string used as a salt for a particular password. The ""hash of the password+salt"" is the cryptographic hash generated from the concatenation of the user's password and its unique salt. This allows the system to retrieve the salt when a user attempts to log in, combine it with the entered password, and then hash the combination to verify against the stored hash."
"Why is it crucial to prevent attackers from obtaining passwords, even if the database is compromised?","It is crucial to prevent attackers from obtaining passwords, even if the database is compromised, because once an attacker has acquired stored ""password hashes"", they are always able to ""brute force hashes offline"". ""Password hashes"" are the output of a cryptographic hash function applied to a password, stored instead of the plaintext password. ""Brute force hashes offline"" is the process of an attacker attempting to guess passwords by systematically trying combinations against stolen hash values on their own system. This poses a persistent and severe security risk, as they can dedicate unlimited resources and time to crack the passwords without further interaction with the system."
What kind of hash algorithms should a defender choose to slow down offline attacks?,"To slow down ""offline attacks"", a defender should choose ""hash algorithms"" that are as ""resource intensive"" as possible. ""Offline attacks"" are password cracking attempts performed by an attacker on their own system, using a stolen database of hashed passwords. ""Hash algorithms"" are mathematical functions used to transform data into a fixed-size string, specifically designed for password hashing. ""Resource intensive"" algorithms are those designed to require significant computational power and time to process, making it much more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks against stolen password hashes."
"What does ""bitsize of password space"" mean?","The ""bitsize of password space"" refers to the ""base-2 logarithm"" of the total number of possible passwords for a given set of character combinations and length. The ""bitsize of password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. The ""base-2 logarithm"" is the power to which the number 2 must be raised to obtain a given number. It is represented by 'k' in the ""2^k"" notation for password entropy. The ""2^k notation"" is a way to express the total number of possible passwords, where 'k' is the bitsize. Essentially, it quantifies the amount of ""entropy"" or randomness in a password, indicating how many bits of information an attacker would need to guess to crack the password. ""Entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password."
How does increasing password length impact the bitsize of the password space?,"Increasing ""password length"" directly and significantly impacts the ""bitsize of the password space"". ""Password length"" refers to the number of characters in a password. The ""bitsize of the password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. As the length ('n') of a password increases, the total number of possible combinations ('c^n') grows exponentially. Since the bitsize ('k') is the base-2 logarithm of this total number, a longer password results in a higher 'k' value, meaning greater entropy and increased difficulty for brute-force attacks."
How does increasing character variety impact the bitsize of the password space?,"Increasing ""character variety"" directly and significantly impacts the ""bitsize of the password space"". ""Character variety"" refers to the number of unique characters available for selection at each position in a password. The ""bitsize of the password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. As the number of choices per character ('c') increases, the total number of possible combinations ('c^n') grows exponentially. Since the bitsize ('k') is the base-2 logarithm of this total number, a wider range of characters results in a higher 'k' value, meaning greater entropy and increased difficulty for brute-force attacks."
What are the implications of a 3GHz PC being able to crack 2^35 complexity within a day?,"The implication of a 3GHz PC being able to crack ""2^35 complexity"" within a day (generous estimate) is that passwords with relatively low ""entropy"" (around 35 bits) are highly vulnerable to ""brute-force attacks"" even on common hardware. ""2^35 complexity"" refers to a password space with 35 bits of entropy, meaning there are 2^35 possible combinations. ""Entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. ""Brute-force attacks"" are guessing attacks against passwords that attempt to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence. This highlights the necessity of using passwords with significantly higher entropy to ensure adequate security against modern cracking capabilities."
"What does ""enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence"" mean in the context of a brute force attack?","In the context of a ""brute force attack"", ""enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence"" means systematically generating every possible password combination, one after another, and for each generated password, computing its corresponding ""hash value"".

A ""hash value"" is the fixed-size output of a cryptographic hash function."
How does a password policy contribute to increasing the difficulties of a brute force attack?,"A ""password policy"" contributes to increasing the difficulties of a ""brute force attack"" by enforcing rules that expand the ""space of possible passwords"". A ""password policy"" is a set of rules designed to enhance password security. A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence. The ""space of possible passwords"" refers to the total number of unique password combinations that an attacker would need to try. This includes requiring longer passwords and a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs). By making passwords longer and more complex, the policy ensures that the number of combinations an attacker must try becomes astronomically large, making the brute force attack impractical or impossible within a reasonable timeframe."
"What does ""high entropy"" mean in the context of passwords?","In the context of passwords, ""high entropy"" refers to a password's high degree of randomness and unpredictability. ""High entropy"" is a state of high randomness and unpredictability in a password, making it difficult to guess. It is measured by the ""bitsize of the password space"" ('k'), where a higher 'k' value indicates greater entropy. The ""bitsize of the password space (k)"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. Passwords with high entropy are difficult for attackers to guess or crack using brute-force methods because the number of possible combinations is extremely large."
"Explain why hashed passwords, even those with high entropy, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks.","Hashed passwords, even with ""high entropy"", can still be vulnerable to ""dictionary attacks"" because dictionary attacks exploit a different weakness than brute-force attacks. ""Hashed passwords"" are passwords that have been transformed into a fixed-size string of characters (a hash value) using a cryptographic hash function. ""High entropy"" refers to a state of high randomness and unpredictability in a password. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. While high entropy protects against random guessing, dictionary attacks target human-chosen passwords that are often derived from common words or patterns found in natural languages. If a high-entropy password is still a common word or a simple variation, it will be in an attacker's dictionary, and its hash will be matched."
What is the core weakness exploited by a dictionary attack?,"The core weakness exploited by a ""dictionary attack"" is the human tendency to choose passwords that are easily memorable and often derived from words in natural languages. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. This predictability in human-chosen passwords allows attackers to compile lists of common words and phrases (a ""dictionary"") and test their hashes against stolen password hashes, rather than needing to try every possible character combination.

A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. While brute force is exhaustive, dictionary attacks are more targeted, leveraging the predictability of human password choices."
What is the overall goal of password salting in terms of security?,"The overall goal of ""password salting"" in terms of security is to significantly reduce the effectiveness of ""offline attacks"" that rely on ""pre-computed hashes"" or ""rainbow tables"".

The ""bitsize of the password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. A higher 'k' value signifies greater entropy, meaning more possible combinations an attacker would need to try, thus making the password more secure against brute-force attacks."
How does the number of choices per character ('c') influence the bitsize of the password space?,"The number of ""choices per character"" ('c') significantly influences the ""bitsize of the password space"" ('k'). ""Choices per character"" refers to the total number of distinct characters available for selection at each position in a password. The ""bitsize of the password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. As 'c' increases, the total number of possible passwords (c^n) grows exponentially, which directly leads to a larger 'k' value. For instance, increasing 'c' from 26 (lowercase) to 95 (keyboard characters) for a 10-character password increases 'k' from 47.0 to 65.7, making the password much harder to crack."
What is the impact of password length ('n') on the total number of possible passwords?,"The ""password length"" ('n') has an exponential impact on the total number of possible passwords. ""Password length"" refers to the number of characters in a password. Given 'c' choices per character, the total number of possible passwords is calculated as 'c^n'. This means that even a small increase in 'n' results in a vastly larger ""password space"", making it exponentially more difficult for an attacker to enumerate all combinations in a brute-force attack."
Explain why a 3GHz PC can crack 2^35 complexity in a day.,"A 3GHz PC can crack ""2^35 complexity"" within a day (generous estimate) because ""2^35 complexity"" represents a relatively low ""bitsize of the password space"", specifically 35 bits of entropy. Modern computing hardware, even a standard 3GHz PC, possesses sufficient processing power to perform 2^35 (approximately 34 billion) hash calculations within a 24-hour period, especially when optimized for such tasks. This demonstrates that passwords with lower entropy are quickly vulnerable to brute-force attacks on readily available hardware."
What is the significance of the table showing bitsize of password space for various character combinations?,"The table showing the ""bitsize of password space"" for various character combinations is significant because it quantifies the ""entropy"" or strength of passwords based on their length and the variety of characters used. The ""bitsize of password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. ""Entropy"" is a measure of the randomness and unpredictability of a password. It illustrates how increasing password length ('n') and the number of choices per character ('c') exponentially increases the 'k' value (bitsize), directly correlating to the difficulty of cracking the password. This table serves as a practical guide for understanding password security requirements."
How does a password policy directly increase the space of possible passwords?,"A ""password policy"" directly increases the ""space of possible passwords"" by enforcing rules that mandate greater length and character variety. A ""password policy"" is a set of rules designed to enhance password security. The ""space of possible passwords"" refers to the total number of unique password combinations an attacker would need to try. For example, requiring a minimum length of 8 characters instead of 6, and demanding the inclusion of mixed case alphanumeric characters and symbols, significantly increases both 'n' (password length) and 'c' (choices per character). This exponential growth in 'c^n' makes the total number of possible combinations much larger, thereby increasing the difficulty for brute-force attacks."
What is the primary difference in attack methodology between brute force and dictionary attacks?,"The primary difference in attack methodology between ""brute force"" and ""dictionary attacks"" lies in their approach to guessing. A ""brute force attack"" employs an exhaustive method, systematically trying *every single possible password combination* and its hash. A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that tries to guess a password by enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence. In contrast, a ""dictionary attack"" uses a targeted approach, attempting only *commonly used words, phrases, and patterns* from a pre-compiled list (a dictionary). A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. This distinction means brute force is computationally intensive across the entire password space, while dictionary attacks leverage human predictability."
Why is it stated that offline brute force of hashes is always possible once acquired?,"It is stated that ""offline brute force of hashes is always possible"" once acquired because the attacker has full control over the cracking environment and resources. ""Offline brute force of hashes"" is the process of an attacker attempting to guess passwords by systematically trying combinations against stolen hash values on their own system. Once the ""password hashes"" are stolen, the attacker does not need to interact with the live system, bypass any rate limits, or worry about account lockouts. They can dedicate unlimited computational power and time to systematically try combinations against the hashes until a match is found, making it a persistent and inevitable threat."
How do resource-intensive hash algorithms help slow down offline attacks?,"""Resource-intensive hash algorithms"" help slow down ""offline attacks"" by increasing the computational cost and time required for each hash calculation. ""Resource-intensive hash algorithms"" are mathematical functions used to transform data into a fixed-size string, designed to require significant computational power and time to execute. ""Offline attacks"" are password cracking attempts performed by an attacker on their own system, using a stolen database of hashed passwords. If an algorithm takes more CPU cycles or memory to compute a single hash, an attacker's ability to try millions or billions of passwords per second is severely hampered, thus extending the time needed to crack passwords to an impractical duration."
What is the role of the hash function in password salting?,"In ""password salting"", the ""hash function"" plays a crucial role by transforming the combined ""password+salt"" into a fixed-size, irreversible hash value. ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. A ""hash function"" is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input into a fixed-size string of characters. The ""password+salt"" is the concatenation of the plaintext password and its unique salt. By applying the hash function to this unique combination, it ensures that even identical passwords result in different stored hashes due to their unique salts, thereby preventing the use of pre-computed hash tables."
"Explain the concept of ""target hashes"" in the context of a brute force attack.","In the context of a ""brute force attack"", ""target hashes"" are the cryptographic hash values of legitimate user passwords that an attacker has obtained from a compromised system. A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that tries to guess a password by enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence. The attacker's objective is to generate candidate passwords, compute their corresponding hash values, and then compare these computed hashes against the stolen ""target hashes"". A match indicates that the original plaintext password has been successfully discovered."
"How does the variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs) contribute to password strength?","The variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs) contributes significantly to ""password strength"" by increasing the ""number of choices per character"" ('c') available for each position in a password. ""Password strength"" is a measure of how resistant a password is to cracking. The ""number of choices per character"" refers to the total number of distinct characters that can be used at each position in a password. A larger 'c' value exponentially increases the total ""password space"" (c^n), which is the total set of all possible passwords. This, in turn, boosts the ""bitsize of the password space"" ('k'), making the password much more resistant to brute-force attacks by requiring an attacker to try a vastly greater number of combinations."
What is the estimated cracking time for 56 bits of complexity using an FPGA Hardware cracker?,"The estimated cracking time for 56 bits of complexity using an ""FPGA Hardware cracker"" is within 5 days. An ""FPGA Hardware cracker"" is a password cracking device that utilizes Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which are reconfigurable integrated circuits that can be programmed to perform specific computational tasks. This provides a benchmark for the capabilities of specialized hardware in cracking passwords with a certain level of entropy."
How does the speed of ASIC crackers compare to a 3GHz PC for password cracking?,"While a 3GHz PC can crack 2^35 complexity (approximately 35 bits of entropy) within a day, ""ASIC crackers"" are stated to be more than 10 times faster than ""FPGA Hardware crackers"", which themselves can crack 56 bits within 5 days. This implies that ASIC crackers are vastly superior in speed compared to a general-purpose 3GHz PC for password cracking, capable of handling significantly higher entropy passwords in much shorter timeframes due to their specialized design."
What is the implication of users having the same password resulting in the same hash value in a password file?,"The implication of users having the same password resulting in the same hash value in a password file is a significant vulnerability, particularly to ""dictionary attacks"". If multiple users choose a common password, their stored ""hash values"" will be identical. A ""dictionary attack"" is a method of password cracking that uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and patterns to guess passwords. This allows an attacker, once they crack one instance of that common password's hash, to immediately identify all other users who share that same weak password by simply looking for matching hash values in the stolen password file. This makes it efficient for attackers to compromise multiple accounts with minimal effort."
How does the concept of 'k' (bitsize) relate to the difficulty of cracking a password?,"The concept of 'k' (the ""bitsize of the password space"") directly relates to the difficulty of cracking a password: a higher 'k' value indicates greater difficulty. The ""bitsize of the password space"" is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, representing the number of bits of entropy. Since 2^k represents the total number of possible password combinations, a larger 'k' means an exponentially larger number of guesses an attacker would need to make in a brute-force attack. This directly translates to increased time and computational resources required to crack the password, making it more secure."
What is the primary benefit of using longer passwords against brute force attacks?,"The primary benefit of using ""longer passwords"" against ""brute force attacks"" is the exponential increase in the ""space of possible passwords"". ""Longer passwords"" are passwords with a greater number of characters. A ""brute force attack"" is a guessing attack against passwords that tries to guess a password by enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence. The ""space of possible passwords"" refers to the total number of unique password combinations an attacker would need to try. Even a small increase in password length ('n') dramatically increases the total number of combinations (c^n), making it significantly more time-consuming and computationally expensive for an attacker to try every possible password."
How does the 'store hash and salt' step in password salting contribute to security?,"The 'store hash and salt' step in ""password salting"" is crucial for security because it ensures that the unique ""salt value"" associated with each password is preserved alongside its hash. ""Password salting"" is a technique used in password storage where a unique, random string (a ""salt"") is appended or prepended to a password before it is hashed. The ""salt value"" is the specific random string used as a salt for a particular password. This allows the system to correctly re-apply the same salt to a user's entered password during login for verification. More importantly, it forces attackers to treat each password's hash as unique, preventing the use of generic pre-computed hash tables and significantly increasing the effort required for offline attacks."
What is the implication of ASIC crackers being more than 10 times faster than FPGA crackers?,"The implication of ""ASIC crackers"" being more than 10 times faster than ""FPGA crackers"" is that highly specialized hardware can achieve extreme efficiency in password cracking. ""ASIC crackers"" are password cracking devices that use Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom-designed chips optimized for a particular task. ""FPGA crackers"" are password cracking devices that utilize Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This speed advantage means that passwords with very high ""bitsize of the password space"" (entropy) that might be considered secure against FPGAs could still be vulnerable to ASICs within a practical timeframe. It underscores the continuous arms race in password security, where defenders must use increasingly robust methods to stay ahead of advanced cracking technology."
Why is it important for a defender to select hash algorithms that are resource intensive?,"It is important for a defender to select ""hash algorithms"" that are ""resource intensive"" because this is the primary way to slow down ""offline attacks"" on stolen password hashes. ""Hash algorithms"" are mathematical functions used to transform data into a fixed-size string, specifically designed for password hashing. ""Resource intensive"" algorithms are those that require significant computational power and time to execute. ""Offline attacks"" are password cracking attempts performed by an attacker on their own system, using a stolen database of hashed passwords. By making each hash computation expensive in terms of CPU, memory, or time, the defender increases the overall cost and time an attacker needs to brute-force or dictionary-attack a large set of passwords, making such attacks less feasible."
