Compare and contrast brute force attacks with dictionary attacks.,"A brute force attack attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence, checking for a match against target hashes. A dictionary attack, on the other hand, exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which often derive from words in natural languages. While high password entropy helps prevent brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially human-generated ones, remain vulnerable to dictionary attack. Dictionary attacks involve guessing commonly used passwords, computing their hash values, and then looking for these hash values in the password file."
Explain the relationship between password entropy and brute force attacks.,"Password entropy, measured by 2^k where 'k' is the bitsize of the password space, directly relates to the difficulty of a brute force attack. A brute force attack tries to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes. Increasing the space of possible passwords, for example, by using longer passwords or allowing more varieties of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), increases the password entropy. Choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attacks because it significantly increases the number of possible combinations an attacker must try, making the attack computationally infeasible within a reasonable timeframe."
Compare the cracking capabilities of software password crackers and FPGA hardware crackers.,"Software password crackers, running on a PC (e.g., a 3GHz PC), can crack a complexity of 2^35 within approximately one day. In contrast, a 1 FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits within 5 days. This indicates that hardware crackers like FPGAs can be more efficient for certain levels of complexity, though ASIC crackers are noted to be even faster."
What are the performance differences between FPGA hardware crackers and ASIC crackers?,"FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware crackers are capable of cracking 56 bits within an estimated 5 days. ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster, being more than 10 times faster than FPGA crackers. This highlights ASICs as the most efficient hardware for password cracking among the mentioned types."
Compare password salting with the use of pre-computed hash tables as security strategies.,"Pre-computed hash tables are a strategy for cracking hashed passwords by storing pairs of passwords and their hashes, which can be used to quickly look up a password given its hash. This approach can be impractical if the number of password candidates ('k') is large, as the table size would be k Ã— n (where 'n' is the hash bit length). Password salting, on the other hand, is a defense mechanism designed to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, random string called a 'salt' to a password before applying the hash function. Each password has its own salt, which is stored alongside the hash of the password+salt. For an attacker, a salt of 'n' bits means they would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password, effectively negating the efficiency gains of generic pre-computed hash tables."
Compare the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase password with a 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password.,"For a 5-character password, using only lowercase characters (26 choices) results in a bitsize of 23.5. If the password uses lowercase alphanumeric characters (36 choices), the bitsize increases to 25.9. This demonstrates that expanding the character set, even for the same password length, significantly increases the password space and thus its entropy."
What is the difference in bitsize between a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password and a 5-character password using keyboard characters?,"For a 5-character password, using mixed case alphanumeric characters (62 choices) yields a bitsize of 29.8. If the password uses keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize further increases to 32.9. This illustrates that a broader range of available characters, such as all keyboard characters, provides a higher bitsize and thus greater security compared to a more restricted set like mixed case alphanumeric characters for the same password length."
Compare the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase password with a 10-character lowercase password.,"A 5-character lowercase password (26 choices per character) has a bitsize of 23.5. In contrast, a 10-character lowercase password (also 26 choices per character) has a significantly higher bitsize of 47.0. This demonstrates that increasing the length of a password, even with the same character set, substantially increases its entropy and the difficulty of cracking it."
What is the difference in bitsize between a 5-character password using keyboard characters and a 10-character password using keyboard characters?,"A 5-character password composed of keyboard characters (95 choices per character) has a bitsize of 32.9. Doubling the length to a 10-character password using the same keyboard characters results in a bitsize of 65.7. This highlights the exponential increase in password entropy and security that comes with increasing password length, even when the character set remains constant."
Compare the concept of a brute force attack with the measure of increasing the space of possible passwords.,"A brute force attack is a method where an attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence until a match is found. In contrast, increasing the space of possible passwords is a defensive measure against brute force attacks. This measure involves making passwords longer and allowing for a greater variety of symbols (such as alphabets, numerals, and signs), which exponentially increases the number of possible password combinations, thereby making a brute force attack more computationally intensive and time-consuming."
Compare password policy as a means to increase difficulties of brute force attack with password salting.,"A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack by dictating requirements such as longer passwords and allowing more varieties of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), thereby increasing the space of possible passwords. Password salting, on the other hand, is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that rely on pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, random string (salt) to each password before hashing it. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to different salts, making pre-computed hash tables ineffective and forcing attackers to compute 2^n hashes for each password attempt if an n-bit salt is used."
Compare the conditions under which passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks versus dictionary attacks.,"Passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks when their entropy is low, meaning the space of possible passwords is small, allowing an attacker to enumerate all combinations in a feasible time. Measures against brute force include increasing password length and character variety. However, even passwords with high entropy, especially human-generated ones, can be vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks exploit the weakness that human-chosen passwords often derive from words in natural languages. This allows attackers to guess commonly used passwords, compute their hashes, and look for matches in a password file, bypassing the need to enumerate all possible combinations."
Compare the bitsize for a 6-character password using 26 choices (lowercase) versus 36 choices (lowercase alphanumeric).,"For a 6-character password, if only lowercase characters (26 choices) are used, the bitsize is 28.2. However, if lowercase alphanumeric characters (36 choices) are used, the bitsize increases to 31.0. This illustrates that expanding the character set available for password creation, even by a relatively small amount, can lead to a noticeable increase in the password's entropy and thus its resistance to brute-force attacks."
Compare the bitsize for a 7-character password using 62 choices (mixed case alphanumeric) versus 95 choices (keyboard characters).,"For a 7-character password, if mixed case alphanumeric characters (62 choices) are used, the bitsize is 41.7. If the character set is expanded to include all keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize increases to 46.0. This demonstrates that a wider range of available characters significantly enhances the entropy of a password, making it more robust against guessing attacks."
Compare the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password with a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password.,"A 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password (36 choices) has a bitsize of 25.9. Increasing the length to 10 characters, while keeping the character set as lowercase alphanumeric, results in a bitsize of 51.7. This comparison clearly shows that doubling the password length significantly increases its bitsize, making it exponentially harder to crack through brute force."
Compare the bitsize of a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password with a 10-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"A 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices) has a bitsize of 29.8. When the length is increased to 10 characters, maintaining the mixed case alphanumeric character set, the bitsize becomes 59.5. This illustrates the substantial increase in password entropy achieved by extending password length, even when the character set remains constant."
Compare the efficiency implications of using a pre-computed hash table versus a direct brute force attack.,"A direct brute force attack involves enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence, checking each one against a target hash. This can be very time-consuming, especially for high-entropy passwords. A pre-computed hash table, however, is a strategy to crack hashed passwords by pre-calculating and storing pairs of passwords and their hashes. This allows an attacker to quickly look up a password if its hash is known, potentially making the cracking process much faster than a sequential brute force, provided the table is available and not too large (k x n, where k is password candidates and n is hash bits). However, this strategy becomes impractical if the number of password candidates 'k' is very large."
Compare how password salting affects the utility of generic pre-computed hashes.,"Generic pre-computed hashes, often stored in a pre-computed hash table, aim to speed up password cracking by providing a lookup mechanism for common password-hash pairs. However, password salting significantly reduces the effectiveness of such offline attacks. By adding a unique, random string (salt) to each password before hashing, even identical passwords will produce different hashes when salted. The salt is stored alongside the hash. This means that for an attacker to use a pre-computed hash approach, they would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password for an n-bit salt, effectively requiring a unique pre-computation for each salted hash, thus negating the efficiency of generic pre-computed tables."
Compare the effect of increasing password length versus increasing character variety on password entropy.,"Both increasing password length and increasing character variety are measures against brute force attacks that aim to increase the space of possible passwords, thereby increasing password entropy. For example, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5. Increasing its length to 10 characters (same character set) increases the bitsize to 47.0. Alternatively, keeping the length at 5 characters but increasing character variety from lowercase (26 choices, 23.5 bitsize) to lowercase alphanumeric (36 choices, 25.9 bitsize) or even keyboard characters (95 choices, 32.9 bitsize) also increases entropy. Both methods contribute to a larger password space, but increasing length often provides a more substantial exponential increase in entropy."
Compare the cracking time for 2^35 complexity on a 3GHz PC with cracking 56 bits on an FPGA hardware cracker.,"A complexity of 2^35 can be cracked within approximately one day on a 3GHz PC. In contrast, a 1 FPGA hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits within 5 days. This comparison highlights that while a PC can handle a certain complexity within a day, an FPGA, though a specialized hardware cracker, takes longer for a slightly higher bit complexity, suggesting different performance characteristics and efficiencies for different types of cracking hardware and complexity levels."
Compare the security implications of storing passwords without salting versus storing them with salting.,"Storing passwords without salting means that identical passwords will produce identical hash values. This makes them vulnerable to offline attacks using pre-computed hash tables, where an attacker can pre-calculate hashes for common passwords and quickly find matches in a compromised password file. Storing passwords with salting, however, significantly enhances security. A unique, random string (the salt) is added to each password before hashing, and this salt is stored alongside the resulting hash. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to the unique salts. Consequently, pre-computed hash tables become ineffective, as an attacker would need to pre-compute hashes for every possible password combined with every possible salt, drastically increasing the computational effort required for cracking."
Compare the primary methods for preventing brute force attacks with those for preventing dictionary attacks.,"The primary method for preventing brute force attacks is to increase the space of possible passwords. This is achieved through measures like using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), which increases password entropy and makes it computationally infeasible to enumerate all combinations. Password policy is an important means to achieve this. For dictionary attacks, while high entropy helps, the core prevention involves mitigating the weakness in human-chosen passwords that tend to derive from natural language words. This is implicitly addressed by encouraging strong, non-dictionary-based passwords, and techniques like salting also help by making it harder to use pre-computed hashes of common dictionary words."
Compare the bitsize of a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password with an 8-character lowercase alphanumeric password.,"A 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password (36 choices) has a bitsize of 36.2. Increasing the length to 8 characters, while maintaining the lowercase alphanumeric character set, results in a bitsize of 41.4. This demonstrates the significant increase in password entropy and security gained by adding even a single character to a password."
Compare the bitsize of an 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password with a 9-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"An 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices) has a bitsize of 47.6. Extending the length to 9 characters, while keeping the mixed case alphanumeric character set, increases the bitsize to 53.6. This illustrates the exponential growth in password complexity and resistance to brute force attacks as password length increases."
Compare the bitsize of a 9-character password using keyboard characters with a 10-character password using keyboard characters.,"A 9-character password composed of keyboard characters (95 choices) has a bitsize of 59.1. Increasing the length to 10 characters, using the same keyboard character set, results in a bitsize of 65.7. This comparison highlights the consistent and substantial increase in password entropy with each additional character, making longer passwords significantly more secure."
Compare the calculation of password complexity (k) for a 5-character lowercase password versus a 5-character password using keyboard characters.,"The complexity 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords. For a 5-character lowercase password, there are 26^5 possible passwords. The complexity 'k' is calculated as [lg(26^5)]/lg2, which equals 23.5. For a 5-character password using keyboard characters, there are 95^5 possible passwords. The complexity 'k' would be calculated as [lg(95^5)]/lg2, which equals 32.9. This shows that increasing the number of choices per character (from 26 to 95) significantly increases the base number for the exponential calculation, leading to a much higher complexity 'k'."
"What is the difference between offline attacks and other types of attacks on passwords, based on the provided document?","The document primarily discusses ""offline attacks,"" which are attacks where an attacker has acquired stored password hashes and can then attempt to brute force these hashes without direct interaction with the live system or application. This means the attacker can perform many guesses without being detected or rate-limited by the system. The document implies that defenders can only slow down these offline attacks by selecting resource-intensive hash algorithms. While not explicitly defining ""online attacks,"" the context suggests that offline attacks are distinct from attempts made directly against a live authentication system."
Compare the security benefits of using resource-intensive hash algorithms versus simpler hash algorithms for password storage.,"When storing passwords, using resource-intensive hash algorithms is a defensive strategy to slow down offline attacks. After an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they can always brute force them offline. By selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible, defenders make each cracking attempt more costly in terms of computational power and time for the attacker. This is in contrast to simpler hash algorithms, which would allow attackers to brute force hashes much more quickly, as they require fewer resources per attempt."
Compare the difficulty of a brute force attack when a strong password policy is enforced versus when no such policy exists.,"When no strong password policy exists, users might choose short passwords with limited character sets, resulting in a small space of possible passwords. This makes a brute force attack relatively easier and quicker, as the attacker has fewer combinations to enumerate. Conversely, when a strong password policy is enforced, it mandates requirements such as longer passwords and the inclusion of a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs). This significantly increases the space of possible passwords, thereby increasing the password's entropy and making a brute force attack much more difficult and time-consuming."
Compare the effectiveness of a dictionary attack when targeting commonly used passwords versus uncommon passwords.,"A dictionary attack is highly effective when targeting commonly used passwords because it exploits the tendency of human-chosen passwords to derive from words in natural languages. Attackers can guess these common passwords, compute their hash values, and efficiently look for matches in a password file. When targeting uncommon passwords, especially those with high entropy and not based on dictionary words, a dictionary attack becomes significantly less effective. Such passwords would not be present in typical dictionaries, forcing attackers to resort to more resource-intensive methods like brute force, which is harder for high-entropy passwords."
Compare the hash values generated for the same password when hashed without a salt versus when hashed with a salt.,"When a password is hashed without a salt, the same password will consistently produce the exact same hash value. This means that if two users choose the identical password, their stored hash values will be identical. However, when a password is hashed with a salt, a unique, random string (the salt) is added to the password *before* the hash function is applied. Consequently, even if two users choose the exact same password, because each password has its own unique salt, the resulting hash values stored will be different. This difference in hash values is crucial for defending against pre-computed hash attacks."
Compare the password entropy for a 5-character lowercase password versus a 6-character lowercase password.,"Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where k is the bitsize. For a 5-character lowercase password (26 choices), the bitsize (k) is 23.5. For a 6-character lowercase password (also 26 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 28.2. This comparison clearly shows that increasing the password length by just one character significantly boosts its entropy, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
Compare the password entropy for a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password versus an 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices), the bitsize (k) is 41.7. For an 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password (also 62 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 47.6. This demonstrates that even a small increase in password length, while keeping the character set constant, leads to a substantial increase in password entropy, making it harder to crack."
Compare the password entropy for a 9-character keyboard characters password versus a 10-character keyboard characters password.,"For a 9-character password using keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize (k) is 59.1. For a 10-character password using keyboard characters (also 95 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 65.7. This comparison highlights the consistent and significant increase in password entropy with each additional character, making longer passwords substantially more secure against brute-force attacks."
Compare the underlying principles of a brute force attack and a dictionary attack.,"The underlying principle of a brute force attack is exhaustive enumeration. It systematically tries every possible combination of characters for a given length and character set until the correct password or its hash is found. The principle relies on the finite, albeit potentially very large, space of possible passwords. In contrast, the underlying principle of a dictionary attack is exploiting human predictability and commonality. It leverages the fact that many human-chosen passwords are not truly random but are derived from words in natural languages or are commonly used phrases. Instead of exhaustive enumeration, it tests a pre-compiled list of likely passwords."
Compare the role of a password policy with the concept of increasing password space in enhancing security.,"Increasing the space of possible passwords is a fundamental measure against brute force attacks, achieved by using longer passwords and allowing more varieties of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs). A password policy serves as the mechanism to enforce and implement this measure. It is an important means to increase the difficulties of brute force attacks by setting rules and requirements for password creation, thereby directly leading to an increase in the space of possible passwords and consequently, higher password entropy."
Compare the feasibility of pre-computing hashes for generic passwords versus pre-computing hashes for salted passwords.,"Pre-computing hashes for generic passwords involves creating a hash table of common passwords and their corresponding hash values. This is feasible for a limited set of passwords and can be used to quickly crack unsalted hashes. However, pre-computing hashes for salted passwords is significantly less feasible. Since each password has its own unique, random salt, an attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password for an n-bit salt. This means that a generic pre-computed hash table would be ineffective, as each salted hash would require a specific, targeted pre-computation, making the process computationally prohibitive for a large number of unique salted hashes."
Compare the bitsize for an 8-character password using 26 choices (lowercase) versus 62 choices (mixed case alphanumeric).,"For an 8-character password, if only lowercase characters (26 choices) are used, the bitsize is 37.6. However, if mixed case alphanumeric characters (62 choices) are used, the bitsize significantly increases to 47.6. This demonstrates that expanding the character set from a limited set of lowercase letters to a broader set including mixed case letters and numbers substantially increases the password's entropy and its resistance to brute-force attacks."
Compare the bitsize for a 9-character password using 36 choices (lowercase alphanumeric) versus 95 choices (keyboard characters).,"For a 9-character password, if lowercase alphanumeric characters (36 choices) are used, the bitsize is 46.5. If the character set is expanded to include all keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize increases to 59.1. This highlights the substantial gain in password entropy and security achieved by utilizing a much wider range of possible characters, even for the same password length."
Compare the password entropy for a 6-character lowercase alphanumeric password versus a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password.,"For a 6-character lowercase alphanumeric password (36 choices), the bitsize (k) is 31.0. For a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password (also 36 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 36.2. This illustrates that increasing the password length by just one character, even with a consistent character set, leads to a notable increase in password entropy, making it more resilient to cracking attempts."
Compare the password entropy for an 8-character password using keyboard characters versus a 9-character password using keyboard characters.,"For an 8-character password using keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize (k) is 52.6. For a 9-character password using keyboard characters (also 95 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 59.1. This comparison emphasizes the consistent and significant increase in password entropy with each additional character, making longer passwords substantially more secure against brute-force attacks."
Compare the password entropy for a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password versus a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices), the bitsize (k) is 35.7. For a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password (also 62 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 41.7. This demonstrates that even a small increase in password length, while keeping the character set constant, leads to a substantial increase in password entropy, making it harder to crack."
Compare the password entropy for a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password versus a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices), the bitsize (k) is 29.8. For a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password (also 62 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 35.7. This illustrates that increasing the password length by just one character, even with a consistent character set, leads to a notable increase in password entropy, making it more resilient to cracking attempts."
Compare the password entropy for a 5-character password using keyboard characters versus a 6-character password using keyboard characters.,"For a 5-character password using keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize (k) is 32.9. For a 6-character password using keyboard characters (also 95 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 39.4. This comparison highlights the consistent and significant increase in password entropy with each additional character, making longer passwords substantially more secure against brute-force attacks."
Compare the password entropy for a 7-character password using keyboard characters versus an 8-character password using keyboard characters.,"For a 7-character password using keyboard characters (95 choices), the bitsize (k) is 46.0. For an 8-character password using keyboard characters (also 95 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 52.6. This comparison emphasizes the consistent and significant increase in password entropy with each additional character, making longer passwords substantially more secure against brute-force attacks."
Compare the password entropy for a 9-character lowercase password versus a 10-character lowercase password.,"For a 9-character lowercase password (26 choices), the bitsize (k) is 42.3. For a 10-character lowercase password (also 26 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 47.0. This demonstrates that increasing the password length by just one character significantly boosts its entropy, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks."
Compare the password entropy for a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password versus a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password.,"For a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password (36 choices), the bitsize (k) is 46.5. For a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password (also 36 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 51.7. This illustrates that increasing the password length by just one character, even with a consistent character set, leads to a notable increase in password entropy, making it more resilient to cracking attempts."
Compare the password entropy for a 9-character mixed case alphanumeric password versus a 10-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"For a 9-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices), the bitsize (k) is 53.6. For a 10-character mixed case alphanumeric password (also 62 choices), the bitsize (k) increases to 59.5. This demonstrates that even a small increase in password length, while keeping the character set constant, leads to a substantial increase in password entropy, making it harder to crack."
Compare the primary source of vulnerability exploited by brute force attacks versus dictionary attacks.,"The primary source of vulnerability exploited by brute force attacks is a limited password space, meaning there are not enough possible password combinations to make exhaustive enumeration computationally infeasible. This often stems from short passwords or restricted character sets. In contrast, the primary source of vulnerability exploited by dictionary attacks is human predictability in password selection. This attack leverages the fact that human-chosen passwords frequently derive from common words, names, or easily guessable patterns found in natural languages, rather than being truly random."
Compare the implications of a compromised password database with the subsequent ability to perform offline brute force attacks.,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. However, if an attacker *does* acquire stored password hashes from a compromised database, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means the attacker can take the hashes and attempt to crack them on their own systems, without interacting with the original application, making it impossible for the defender to prevent the attack entirely, only to slow it down by using resource-intensive hash algorithms. The compromised database provides the necessary data (hashes) for the offline brute force to commence."
