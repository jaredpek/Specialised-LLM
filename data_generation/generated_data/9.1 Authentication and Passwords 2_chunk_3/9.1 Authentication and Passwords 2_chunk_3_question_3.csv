What is a brute force attack?,A brute force attack is a guessing attack against passwords that attempts to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. It then checks if any of these generated hashes match the target hashes.
How does a brute force attack work?,"A brute force attack works by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and computing their hashes. These computed hashes are then compared against the target hashes to find a match, thereby revealing the password."
What measures can be taken to defend against brute force attacks?,"A primary measure against brute force attacks is to increase the space of possible passwords. This can be achieved by requiring longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs, which makes the enumeration process significantly more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker."
Explain the role of password policy in mitigating brute force attacks.,"Password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing policies that require longer passwords and a wider range of character types (alphabets, numerals, signs), the policy effectively expands the total number of possible password combinations, making it exponentially harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to guess the correct password through enumeration."
What is the fundamental objective of a brute force guessing attack?,The fundamental objective of a brute force guessing attack is to discover a password by exhaustively trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password and its hash are found to match the target hashes.
"What does ""PASSWORD ENTROPY-measured by 2^k"" signify?","""PASSWORD ENTROPY-measured by 2^k"" signifies that the complexity or strength of a password is quantified by the number of bits, 'k', required to represent the size of its possible password space. A larger 'k' indicates higher entropy and thus a more secure password."
Describe the information presented in Table 10.1.,"Table 10.1 presents the bitsize of the password space for various character combinations. It shows the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords, where the number of n-character passwords, given 'c' choices per character, is calculated as c^n. The table illustrates how password length ('n') and character set size ('c') impact the password's entropy."
How is the number of possible n-character passwords calculated given 'c' choices per character?,"The number of possible n-character passwords, given 'c' choices per character, is calculated using the formula c^n. Here, 'c' represents the number of unique characters available for selection (e.g., 26 for lowercase alphabets), and 'n' represents the length of the password."
"What is the significance of the ""bitsize of password space"" as shown in Table 10.1?","The ""bitsize of password space"" in Table 10.1 represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords for a given length and character set. This value, denoted as 'k', quantifies the entropy of the password, indicating the computational effort required to brute-force it. A higher bitsize means greater security."
What is the current cracking speed of software password crackers per personal computer?,"At present, software password crackers are capable of cracking up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer. This high cracking speed highlights the importance of strong password policies and high password entropy to resist such attacks."
"How is the complexity of a password, represented by 'k', determined from the number of possible passwords?","The complexity of a password, represented by 'k', is determined by solving the equation 2^k = N, where N is the total number of possible passwords. This means 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of N, or k = [lg(N)]/lg2. For example, if there are 26^5 possible passwords, k = [lg(26^5)]/lg2."
Explain the calculation for the number of possible 5-character lowercase passwords.,"For 5-character lowercase passwords, there are 26 possible choices for each character (the 26 letters of the alphabet). Since the password has 5 characters, the total number of possible passwords is calculated as 26 raised to the power of 5, which is 26^5."
"What is the 'k' value for a 5-character lowercase password, and how is it derived?","For a 5-character lowercase password, the 'k' value is 23.5. This is derived by first calculating the total number of possible passwords, which is 26^5. Then, to find 'k', one solves the equation 2^k = 26^5, which results in k = [lg(26^5)]/lg2 = 23.5. This 'k' value represents the bitsize of the password space."
"If the first entry in Table 10.1 corresponds to 5-character lowercase passwords, what does this imply about the character set and length?","If the first entry in Table 10.1 corresponds to 5-character lowercase passwords, it implies that the password length ('n') is 5 characters, and the character set ('c') consists of 26 lowercase alphabetic characters. This combination yields a specific bitsize of password space."
What is the mathematical expression for finding the complexity 'k' given 'c' choices per character and 'n' password length?,"The mathematical expression for finding the complexity 'k' is k = [lg(c^n)]/lg2. Here, 'c' is the number of character choices, 'n' is the password length, and 'lg' denotes the common logarithm (base 10), which is then divided by lg2 to convert it to a base-2 logarithm. This formula calculates the bitsize of the password space."
How quickly can a 3GHz PC crack passwords with 2^35 complexity?,"A 3GHz PC, under a generous estimate, can crack passwords with 2^35 complexity within a single day. This illustrates the significant processing power available for password cracking, even with standard hardware."
What is the cracking capability of an FPGA hardware cracker in terms of bits and time?,An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware cracker is estimated to be capable of cracking 56 bits of password complexity within 5 days. This demonstrates the enhanced performance of specialized hardware compared to general-purpose CPUs for such tasks.
How do ASIC crackers compare in speed to FPGA hardware crackers?,"ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster than FPGA hardware crackers, being capable of cracking passwords at more than 10 times the speed of an FPGA. This makes ASICs the most efficient hardware for high-volume password cracking operations."
What is the estimated time for an FPGA hardware cracker to crack 56 bits?,An FPGA hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits of password complexity within 5 days. This provides a benchmark for the performance of dedicated hardware in password cracking scenarios.
What is the implication of a 3GHz PC cracking 2^35 complexity within a day for password security?,"The implication of a 3GHz PC cracking 2^35 complexity within a day is that passwords with entropy levels around 35 bits are highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, even with readily available consumer-grade hardware. This underscores the necessity for passwords to have significantly higher entropy to ensure adequate security."
What is a dictionary attack?,"A dictionary attack is a method of cracking hashed passwords that exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which often derive from words in natural languages. It involves guessing commonly used passwords, computing their hash values, and then looking for matches in the stored password file."
How does choosing passwords with high entropy relate to brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks?,"Choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attacks by making the search space too large for exhaustive enumeration. However, even hashed passwords with high entropy, especially if human-generated, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks if they are based on common words or patterns found in natural languages."
Why are human-generated passwords particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks?,"Human-generated passwords are particularly vulnerable to dictionary attacks because people tend to choose passwords that are easy to remember, often deriving them from words, phrases, or simple modifications of words found in natural languages. This predictability allows attackers to pre-compile lists of common passwords and their hashes."
What specific weakness does a dictionary attack exploit?,"A dictionary attack specifically exploits the weakness in human-chosen passwords, which tend to derive from words in natural languages. This means that instead of trying every possible character combination, the attacker can focus on a much smaller, more probable set of words and common phrases."
"Outline the steps an attacker would take in a dictionary attack, especially when users might have the same password.","In a dictionary attack, an attacker would take the following steps: first, guess some commonly used passwords (often from a pre-compiled dictionary list); second, compute the hash values for these guessed passwords; and third, look for the same hash values in the password file. If a match is found, it indicates the original password."
What is a pre-computed hash table in the context of password cracking?,A pre-computed hash table is a strategy for cracking hashed passwords that involves creating a table containing pre-calculated pairs of passwords and their corresponding hashes. This table allows an attacker to quickly look up a hash value and find the original password without needing to compute the hash in real-time during an attack.
How is a pre-computed hash table used to crack hashed passwords?,"A pre-computed hash table is used to crack hashed passwords by providing a lookup mechanism. An attacker can take a target hash, search for it in the pre-computed table, and if found, retrieve the associated plaintext password. This bypasses the need for real-time hash computation, speeding up the cracking process."
What determines the size of a pre-computed hash table?,"The size of a pre-computed hash table is determined by the number of password candidates ('k') and the bit length of each hash ('n'). Specifically, if there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table will have a size of k \u00d7 n."
Under what circumstances might using a pre-computed hash table not be practical?,"Using a pre-computed hash table might not be practical when the number of password candidates ('k') is very large. A large 'k' would result in an extremely large table size (k \u00d7 n), requiring immense storage capacity and potentially making the table unwieldy or impossible to generate and store."
What information does a pre-computed hash table typically contain?,"A pre-computed hash table typically contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values. These pairs are generated in advance, allowing for rapid lookup during a password cracking attempt, rather than computing hashes on the fly."
What is password salting and its primary purpose?,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. Its primary purpose is to add a unique, random string, known as a ""salt,"" to a password before applying the hash function, making pre-computation attacks like rainbow tables much harder."
How does adding a salt to a password before hashing reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks?,Adding a salt to a password before hashing reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks by ensuring that even identical passwords will produce different hash values because each password is combined with a unique salt. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) that rely on a single hash value for a given password.
"Define ""salt"" in the context of password security.","In the context of password security, a ""salt"" is a random string that is added to a password before it is hashed. It is unique for each password, even if the passwords themselves are identical, and is stored along with the resulting hash of the password+salt combination."
Where is the salt value stored after it has been used to hash a password?,"After a salt value has been used to hash a password, it is stored along with the resulting hash of the password+salt combination. This allows the system to retrieve the correct salt when verifying a user's password, combining it with the entered password, and then hashing the combination for comparison."
What is the impact of an n-bit salt on an attacker's efforts to pre-compute hashes?,"The impact of an n-bit salt on an attacker's efforts to pre-compute hashes is significant: for a salt of 'n' bits, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password. This effectively multiplies the required pre-computation effort by 2^n, making it computationally infeasible for large 'n'."
Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker because even if the application or database is compromised, the actual passwords should remain secure. This protects user accounts and prevents attackers from using compromised credentials elsewhere."
What is the consequence if an attacker acquires stored password hashes?,"If an attacker acquires stored password hashes, the consequence is that they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means they can dedicate significant computational resources over time to crack the passwords without needing to interact with the live system, making the passwords vulnerable."
"As a defender, what is the primary strategy to slow down offline password attacks?","As a defender, the primary strategy to slow down offline password attacks is to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This makes the process of computing hashes (and thus brute-forcing them) computationally expensive and time-consuming for an attacker, even with powerful hardware."
What characteristics should hash algorithms possess to effectively slow down offline attacks?,"To effectively slow down offline attacks, hash algorithms should possess characteristics that make them resource-intensive. This means they should require significant computational power, memory, or time to execute, thereby increasing the cost and time required for an attacker to brute-force password hashes."
What is the ultimate goal of implementing secure password storage practices?,"The ultimate goal of implementing secure password storage practices is to protect user passwords from being compromised, even in the event of a data breach or system compromise. This involves preventing attackers from obtaining plaintext passwords and making it extremely difficult and time-consuming for them to crack stored password hashes offline."
What specific elements does a brute force attack enumerate?,"A brute force attack enumerates all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. This exhaustive enumeration is performed to find a match with the target hashes, thereby revealing the password."
What is the meaning of 'c' and 'n' in the context of password space calculation (c^n)?,"In the context of password space calculation (c^n), 'c' represents the number of choices per character (i.e., the size of the character set available), and 'n' represents the length of the password in characters. The product c^n gives the total number of possible passwords."
How does increasing password length affect the bitsize of password space?,"Increasing password length ('n') significantly increases the bitsize of password space. Since the number of possible passwords is c^n, a linear increase in 'n' leads to an exponential increase in the total number of combinations, and consequently, a larger base-2 logarithm (bitsize 'k')."
What is the base for the logarithm used to calculate 'k' in password complexity?,"The base for the logarithm used to calculate 'k' in password complexity is base-2. The formula k = [lg(N)]/lg2 effectively converts the common logarithm (base 10) of the number of possible passwords (N) into its base-2 logarithm, which represents the bitsize of the password space."
"What is a ""generous estimate"" in the context of a 3GHz PC cracking 2^35 complexity?","A ""generous estimate"" in the context of a 3GHz PC cracking 2^35 complexity within a day implies that this is likely an optimistic calculation of the cracking speed, possibly assuming ideal conditions or maximum efficiency. It suggests that in real-world scenarios, it might take longer, but even this estimate highlights the vulnerability of lower-entropy passwords."
What is the primary reason that choosing passwords with high entropy alone is insufficient to prevent all types of password attacks?,"Choosing passwords with high entropy alone is insufficient to prevent all types of password attacks because human-generated passwords, even if they appear to have high entropy, are often derived from words or patterns in natural languages. This makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks, which exploit these commonalities rather than brute-forcing random character combinations."
What is the main advantage of using a pre-computed hash table for an attacker?,"The main advantage of using a pre-computed hash table for an attacker is speed. By having password-hash pairs already calculated, the attacker can perform a quick lookup for a target hash instead of having to compute the hash for every possible password guess in real-time, significantly accelerating the cracking process."
Why is it important that each password has its own unique salt?,"It is important that each password has its own unique salt because this prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) for multiple passwords simultaneously. If all passwords shared the same salt, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for that specific salt, but with unique salts, a separate pre-computation would be needed for each individual password, making the attack infeasible."
"What does ""brute force hashes offline"" mean in the context of an attacker acquiring stored password hashes?","""Brute force hashes offline"" means that an attacker, after acquiring stored password hashes, can attempt to crack them using computational resources that are not connected to the original system or network. This allows them to perform exhaustive guessing attacks without triggering alarms, being rate-limited, or being detected by the target system, and they can dedicate unlimited time and processing power to the task."
What is the implication of an attacker always being able to brute force hashes offline?,"The implication of an attacker always being able to brute force hashes offline is that the security of stored passwords ultimately depends on the strength of the hashing algorithm and the entropy of the passwords themselves, rather than the security of the live system. Once hashes are stolen, the defense shifts entirely to making the cracking process computationally prohibitive."
