Compare brute force guessing attack with dictionary attack.,"A brute force guessing attack against passwords tries to guess a password by enumerating all passwords and their hashes in sequence, checking if they match the target hashes. A dictionary attack, on the other hand, exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which tend to derive from words in natural languages. It involves guessing commonly used passwords, computing their hash values, and then looking for these hash values in the password file. While choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially human-generated ones, are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks."
What are the differences in defense strategies against brute force attacks and dictionary attacks?,"A primary measure against a brute force attack is to increase the space of possible passwords, for example, by using longer passwords and allowing more varieties of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs). A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. For dictionary attacks, the document implies that choosing passwords with high entropy helps prevent brute-force attacks, but human-generated passwords remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks due to their derivation from natural language words. Password salting is a technique to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, which can be used in conjunction with dictionary attacks."
Compare the cracking capabilities of software password crackers and FPGA hardware crackers.,"Software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per PC. For example, a 3GHz PC can crack 2^35 complexity within a day (generous estimate). In contrast, an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware cracker can crack 56 bits within 5 days (estimate). This indicates that hardware crackers like FPGAs are designed for more intensive cracking tasks, often dealing with higher bit complexities over a period."
What is the performance difference between FPGA hardware crackers and ASIC crackers?,"FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware crackers can crack 56 bits within 5 days (estimated). ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster, being more than 10 times faster than FPGA crackers."
Compare password salting as a defense mechanism with the use of a pre-computed hash table as an attack strategy.,"A pre-computed hash table is a strategy for cracking hashed passwords by storing pairs of passwords and their hashes. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table size would be 'k × n', which may be impractical if 'k' is large. Password salting, on the other hand, is a defense mechanism designed to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that use pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique random string, called a salt, to a password before applying the hash function. This salt value is then stored along with the hash of the password+salt. For an attacker, a salt of 'n' bits means they would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password, significantly increasing the computational effort required for pre-computed hash table attacks."
Compare the roles of password policy and password salting in enhancing password security.,"A password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack by enforcing measures such as longer passwords and a wider variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs), thereby increasing the space of possible passwords. Password salting, however, is a technique specifically designed to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. It works by adding a unique random string, known as a salt, to each password before it is hashed. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different, making pre-computed hash tables less effective."
Compare increasing password length with increasing the variety of symbols as measures against brute force attacks.,"Both increasing password length and increasing the variety of symbols are measures against brute force attacks, as they both increase the space of possible passwords. For example, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5, while a 10-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 47.0. This demonstrates how increasing length significantly increases complexity. Similarly, for a 5-character password, using only lowercase letters (26 choices) results in a bitsize of 23.5, whereas using keyboard characters (95 choices) results in a bitsize of 32.9. This shows that increasing the variety of symbols also substantially increases the password space and thus the difficulty of a brute force attack."
What is the difference between 'c' and 'n' in the context of password entropy calculation?,"In the context of password entropy calculation, 'n' represents the number of characters in a password, while 'c' represents the number of choices per character. The total number of possible passwords is calculated as c^n. The bitsize of this password space, denoted as 'k', is the base-2 logarithm of c^n, which is k = [lg(c^n)]/lg2."
"Compare the concept of ""password space"" with ""bitsize of password space"".","The ""password space"" refers to the total number of possible passwords that can be generated given a certain number of characters ('n') and a set of available choices per character ('c'). It is calculated as c^n. The ""bitsize of password space,"" denoted as 'k', is the base-2 logarithm of this number of possible passwords. It quantifies the complexity or entropy of the password space, where k = [lg(c^n)]/lg2. For example, for 5-character lowercase passwords (c=26, n=5), the bitsize of the password space is 23.5."
Compare the bitsize of password space for lowercase alphanumeric passwords versus mixed case alphanumeric passwords of the same length.,"For a given password length, mixed case alphanumeric passwords offer a significantly larger bitsize of password space compared to lowercase alphanumeric passwords. For instance, a 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password (36 choices per character) has a bitsize of 25.9. In contrast, a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password (62 choices per character) has a bitsize of 29.8. This difference in bitsize increases with password length; for a 10-character password, lowercase alphanumeric has a bitsize of 51.7, while mixed case alphanumeric has a bitsize of 59.5. This is because mixed case alphanumeric includes more character choices, increasing 'c' and thus 'k'."
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character lowercase password versus a 10-character lowercase password.,Increasing the length of a password significantly increases its bitsize of password space. A 5-character lowercase password (with 26 choices per character) has a bitsize of 23.5. Doubling the length to a 10-character lowercase password (still with 26 choices per character) results in a bitsize of 47.0. This demonstrates the exponential increase in complexity as the number of characters ('n') grows.
Compare the bitsize of password space for a 5-character lowercase password versus a 5-character password using keyboard characters.,"The variety of symbols used in a password greatly impacts its bitsize of password space. A 5-character lowercase password (with 26 choices per character) has a bitsize of 23.5. If the same 5-character password uses the full set of keyboard characters (95 choices per character), its bitsize increases to 32.9. This illustrates how expanding the character set ('c') significantly enhances password complexity, making it harder to crack through brute force."
Compare the methodology of a brute force guessing attack with the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking passwords.,"A brute force guessing attack against passwords involves enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence, then checking if any match the target hashes. This is an on-the-fly computation. In contrast, the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table involves generating and storing pairs of passwords and their hashes beforehand. Attackers then use this pre-computed table to quickly look up hashes of target passwords, rather than computing them in real-time. This method can be impractical if the number of password candidates ('k') is very large, leading to a table of size 'k × n' where 'n' is the hash bit length."
Compare the vulnerability of hashed passwords to brute force attacks versus dictionary attacks.,"Hashed passwords, when chosen with high entropy, are generally more resistant to brute force attacks because the vast ""password space"" makes enumerating all possibilities computationally infeasible. However, these same hashed passwords, especially if they are human-generated, remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Dictionary attacks exploit the tendency of human-chosen passwords to derive from words in natural languages, allowing attackers to guess commonly used passwords, compute their hashes, and find matches in a password file."
"What are the differences between offline attacks and online attacks on password hashes, as implied by the document?","The document primarily discusses ""offline attacks"" where an attacker has acquired stored password hashes and can then brute force these hashes without direct interaction with the live system. This means the attacker can perform numerous guesses at their own computational speed. Password salting is introduced as a method to reduce the effectiveness of these offline attacks, particularly those using pre-computed hashes. While not explicitly defined, ""online attacks"" would imply attempts to guess passwords directly against a live system, which typically has rate limiting and lockout mechanisms to deter such attempts. The document focuses on the challenges and defenses related to the scenario where hashes have already been compromised and are being attacked offline."
Compare password hashing without a salt versus password hashing with a salt in terms of security against pre-computed hash tables.,"When passwords are hashed without a salt, the same password will always produce the same hash value. This vulnerability allows attackers to create pre-computed hash tables (also known as rainbow tables) containing common passwords and their corresponding hashes. If multiple users have the same password, they will share the same hash value, making them all vulnerable if that hash is compromised. With password salting, a unique random string (the salt) is added to a password *before* it is hashed. The salt is then stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This ensures that even if two users have the exact same password, their stored hashes will be different because a unique salt was applied to each. Consequently, an attacker using a pre-computed hash table would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same password* for an n-bit salt, significantly increasing the computational effort required for pre-computed hash table attacks."
Compare the vulnerability of human-generated passwords with high entropy passwords to different types of attacks.,"High entropy passwords are those with a large ""bitsize of password space,"" typically achieved through length and variety of characters. Choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attacks because the sheer number of possibilities makes enumeration infeasible. However, human-generated passwords, even if they appear complex, often tend to derive from words in natural languages or predictable patterns. This makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks, where attackers guess commonly used passwords and their hashes. Therefore, while high entropy is crucial against brute force, human-generated passwords still pose a risk to dictionary attacks, whereas truly random, high-entropy passwords would be more resistant to both."
"Compare the distinct roles of a ""salt"" and a ""hash function"" in securing passwords.","A hash function is a one-way mathematical algorithm that transforms an input (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value. This process is irreversible, meaning the original password cannot be recovered from its hash. The role of a salt, which is a random string, is to be added to a password *before* the hash function is applied. Its primary purpose is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that use pre-computed hashes. By ensuring each password has its own unique salt, even identical passwords will produce different hash values, thus preventing attackers from using pre-computed tables to crack multiple passwords simultaneously or to quickly identify common passwords. The salt value is stored alongside the hash of the password+salt."
Compare the time taken to crack 2^35 complexity on a 3GHz PC versus cracking 56 bits with an FPGA hardware cracker.,"Cracking 2^35 complexity on a 3GHz PC is estimated to take within a day. In contrast, an FPGA hardware cracker can crack 56 bits within 5 days. This comparison highlights the different scales of complexity and the specialized hardware involved. While 2^35 represents a very large number of possibilities, the PC can handle it within a day. The FPGA, though a hardware cracker, is specified to crack a smaller bit complexity (56 bits) over a longer period (5 days), suggesting that the ""bits"" here might refer to a different metric or that the FPGA is tackling a different type of problem or a more difficult 56-bit space."
Compare password storage without specific protection measures versus storage using resource-intensive hash algorithms.,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force hashes offline. If no specific protection measures are taken, this offline brute-forcing can be relatively quick depending on the password complexity and attacker's resources. As a defender, it is only possible to slow down these offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This means that even if hashes are compromised, the attacker will expend significant computational resources and time to crack them, making the attack less practical and providing a window for detection and mitigation."
Compare what a brute force guessing attack exploits versus what a dictionary attack exploits.,"A brute force guessing attack exploits the finite (though potentially very large) space of all possible passwords. It attempts to enumerate every single combination of characters until the correct password or its hash is found. A dictionary attack, on the other hand, exploits the weakness in human-chosen passwords. These passwords tend to derive from words in natural languages, common phrases, or predictable patterns. By guessing commonly used passwords and computing their hashes, the dictionary attack leverages this human tendency rather than attempting all possible combinations."
Compare the practicality of a pre-computed hash table when 'k' is small versus when 'k' is large.,"A pre-computed hash table is a strategy for cracking hashed passwords by storing pairs of passwords and their hashes. If 'k' represents the number of password candidates and 'n' is the number of bits in each hash, the table size is 'k × n'. When 'k' is small, meaning there are a limited number of password candidates, creating and storing such a table is practical. However, if 'k' is large, the resulting table size of 'k × n' becomes impractically massive, making the pre-computed hash table strategy infeasible due to storage and lookup constraints."
Compare the general impact of increasing 'c' (choices per character) versus increasing 'n' (number of characters) on password entropy.,"Both increasing 'c' (the number of choices per character) and increasing 'n' (the number of characters in a password) contribute to increasing password entropy, which is measured by the bitsize 'k' (base-2 logarithm of c^n). Increasing 'n' has an exponential effect on the total number of possible passwords (c^n), as it's an exponent in the formula. For example, doubling 'n' roughly doubles 'k' (e.g., 5-char lowercase k=23.5, 10-char lowercase k=47.0). Increasing 'c' also increases the base of the exponentiation, leading to a significant increase in 'k'. For instance, for a 5-character password, moving from 26 choices (lowercase) to 95 choices (keyboard characters) increases 'k' from 23.5 to 32.9. Both are crucial for creating strong passwords, but 'n' often provides a more dramatic increase in entropy for each additional character."
Compare the storage of password hashes alone versus the storage of hashes of password+salt.,"When storing password hashes alone, the hash value is derived directly from the password. If multiple users have the same password, their stored hash values will be identical. This makes them vulnerable to attacks like dictionary attacks using pre-computed hash tables, as a single pre-computed hash can reveal multiple user accounts simultaneously. This also makes it easier to identify common passwords. With password salting, a unique random string (salt) is added to the password *before* hashing. The resulting hash is then the hash of (password + salt). The salt value itself is stored along with this hash of password+salt. This ensures that even if two users have the exact same password, because each password has its own unique salt, their stored hash values will be different. This significantly reduces the effectiveness of pre-computed hash tables and makes it harder for attackers to identify common passwords or crack multiple accounts simultaneously."
Compare the purpose of pre-computing a hash table with the purpose of adding a salt to a password.,"The purpose of pre-computing a hash table is to serve as an attack strategy. It involves an attacker generating and storing a large collection of password-hash pairs in advance. This allows for rapid lookup of a target hash to find the corresponding password, bypassing the need for real-time computation during an attack. Conversely, the purpose of adding a salt to a password is a defense mechanism. A salt is a random string added to a password before hashing. Its goal is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that rely on pre-computed hashes. By ensuring each password has a unique salt, identical passwords will produce different hash values, forcing attackers to compute hashes individually for each salted password, thus negating the efficiency gains of pre-computed tables."
Compare the difficulty of a brute force attack against short passwords versus long passwords.,"A brute force attack against short passwords is significantly less difficult than against long passwords. The difficulty of a brute force attack is directly related to the ""space of possible passwords,"" which is determined by the password's length ('n') and the variety of symbols ('c'). For example, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5, while a 10-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 47.0. This exponential increase in bitsize for longer passwords means that the attacker needs to enumerate a vastly greater number of combinations, making the attack much more time-consuming and computationally expensive, thus increasing its difficulty."
Compare the difficulty of a brute force attack against passwords with limited symbol variety versus those with wide symbol variety.,"A brute force attack against passwords with limited symbol variety is less difficult than against those with wide symbol variety. The difficulty is determined by the ""space of possible passwords,"" which is influenced by the number of choices per character ('c'). For instance, a 5-character password using only lowercase letters (26 choices) has a bitsize of 23.5. If the same 5-character password uses a wide variety of keyboard characters (95 choices), its bitsize increases to 32.9. This demonstrates that increasing the symbol variety significantly expands the password space, requiring the attacker to enumerate many more combinations and thus increasing the difficulty and time required for a brute force attack."
"Compare the ""number of possible passwords"" (c^n) with its ""base-2 logarithm"" (k) in the context of password entropy.","The ""number of possible passwords"" (c^n) represents the absolute count of all unique combinations that can be formed given 'n' characters and 'c' choices per character. This value can be extremely large. The ""base-2 logarithm of this number"" (k) is a measure of the password's entropy or complexity, expressed in bits. It quantifies how much information is contained in the password. For example, if there are 2^k possible passwords, then 'k' is the bitsize. The table provides 'k' values directly, such as 23.5 for 5-character lowercase passwords, which means there are 2^23.5 possible passwords. While c^n gives the raw count, 'k' provides a more manageable and standardized way to compare the strength of different password configurations."
What is the difference in time taken to crack 2^35 complexity on a 3GHz PC compared to cracking 56 bits with an FPGA hardware cracker?,"Cracking 2^35 complexity on a 3GHz PC is estimated to take within a day. In contrast, an FPGA hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits within 5 days. This highlights that while a PC can handle a very high complexity (2^35) in a relatively short time, the FPGA, despite being specialized hardware, takes longer for a seemingly smaller bit complexity (56 bits), suggesting different underlying attack scenarios or definitions of ""bits"" in this context."
Compare the general goal of password storage with specific defense mechanisms like salting.,"The general goal of password storage is to ensure that passwords are stored in a manner that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the underlying application or database is compromised. This overarching objective aims to protect user credentials from unauthorized access. Specific defense mechanisms, such as password salting, are techniques employed to achieve this general goal by addressing particular attack vectors. Salting, for instance, specifically aims to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that use pre-computed hashes by adding a unique random string (salt) to each password before hashing, thereby making pre-computed tables ineffective."
"Using Table 10.1, compare the impact of increasing 'c' (choices per character) versus increasing 'n' (number of characters) on password entropy.","From Table 10.1, increasing 'n' (number of characters) has a substantial impact on password entropy. For example, keeping 'c' constant at 26 (lowercase), increasing 'n' from 5 to 10 increases the bitsize 'k' from 23.5 to 47.0. This is a near-doubling of entropy for a doubling of length. Increasing 'c' (choices per character) also significantly impacts entropy. For a constant 'n' of 5 characters, increasing 'c' from 26 (lowercase) to 95 (keyboard characters) increases 'k' from 23.5 to 32.9. Both factors are critical, but the table illustrates how each additional character ('n') adds a consistent increment to 'k' (e.g., roughly 4.7 bits per character for lowercase), while expanding the character set ('c') provides a one-time jump in entropy for all lengths."
"What is the difference between offline brute force and online brute force attacks, based on the document's context?","The document explicitly states that ""After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force hashes offline."" This defines an ""offline brute force"" attack as one where the attacker has obtained the hashed passwords and can then attempt to crack them using their own computational resources, without needing to interact with the live system. This allows for rapid, unthrottled guessing. While ""online brute force"" is not explicitly defined, it is implied as the alternative where an attacker attempts to guess passwords directly against a live system, which would typically be protected by rate limiting, account lockouts, and other defenses that slow down or prevent such attacks. The document emphasizes that defenders can only slow down *offline* attacks by using resource-intensive hash algorithms."
Compare the vulnerability of high-entropy hashed passwords to dictionary attacks versus brute force attacks.,"High-entropy hashed passwords are designed to prevent brute-force attacks. By increasing the password length and character set variety, the ""bitsize of password space"" (k) becomes very large, making it computationally infeasible for an attacker to enumerate all possible combinations. However, the document states that ""choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attack. However, hashed passwords, especially for human-generated passwords, are still vulnerable to dictionary attack."" This means that even if a password has high entropy, if it is derived from natural language words or common patterns (as human-generated passwords often are), it can still be susceptible to a dictionary attack. Dictionary attacks do not rely on brute-forcing the entire space but rather on guessing common, human-chosen patterns."
Define and differentiate 'c' and 'n' as used in password entropy calculation.,"In the context of password entropy, 'c' represents the number of choices per character, which is the size of the character set from which each character in the password can be drawn (e.g., 26 for lowercase alphabets, 95 for keyboard characters). 'n' represents the number of characters in the password, which is its length. The total number of possible passwords is calculated as c^n, and the base-2 logarithm of this number gives the bitsize of the password space, denoted as 'k'."
Compare the method of directly increasing password space with the method of using a password policy to increase brute force attack difficulty.,"Directly increasing password space involves making passwords longer or allowing a wider variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs). This directly expands the number of possible password combinations (c^n), thereby increasing the bitsize 'k' and making brute force attacks more difficult. A password policy, on the other hand, is an important *means* to achieve this. It is a set of rules or guidelines that enforces the use of longer passwords and/or a greater variety of symbols. So, while increasing password space is the technical measure that makes brute force harder, a password policy is the administrative tool used to implement and enforce these measures for users."
Compare the cracking speed of a 3GHz PC with that of an FPGA hardware cracker.,"A 3GHz PC, using software password crackers, can crack up to 16 million passwords per second. It is estimated that such a PC can crack 2^35 complexity within a day. An FPGA hardware cracker, however, is specified to crack 56 bits within 5 days. This indicates that while PCs are capable of high-speed cracking for certain complexities, FPGAs are specialized hardware that can tackle different types or scales of password complexities, potentially offering different performance characteristics depending on the specific attack."
"Compare the concepts of ""offline attacks"" and ""pre-computed hashes"" in the context of password salting.","""Offline attacks"" refer to scenarios where an attacker has obtained stored password hashes and attempts to crack them using their own computational resources, without interacting with the live system. This allows for unthrottled guessing. ""Pre-computed hashes"" are a technique used in offline attacks, where attackers generate and store a large table of password-hash pairs in advance to speed up the cracking process. Password salting is a defense mechanism designed to reduce the effectiveness of these *offline attacks* that specifically rely on *pre-computed hashes*. By adding a unique random salt to each password before hashing, salting ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes, thereby rendering generic pre-computed hash tables useless and forcing attackers to compute hashes individually for each salted password."
"Compare the ""guessing"" aspect of a brute force guessing attack with that of a dictionary attack.","In a brute force guessing attack, the ""guessing"" involves systematically enumerating *all* possible passwords and their hashes in sequence. This is an exhaustive search through the entire password space. In contrast, for a dictionary attack, the ""guessing"" is focused on a predefined list of commonly used passwords, words from natural languages, or predictable patterns. It does not attempt to enumerate all possibilities but rather targets a subset of passwords that humans are likely to choose. Both are guessing attacks, but their scope and method of generating guesses differ significantly."
Compare the security implications of having shared hash values versus unique hash values for passwords.,"If passwords result in shared hash values (e.g., if two users have the same password and no salt is used), it creates a significant security vulnerability. An attacker who obtains a password file can use a pre-computed hash table or dictionary attack to find a hash value, and if that hash value corresponds to a common password, it could potentially compromise multiple user accounts simultaneously. This also makes it easier to identify common passwords. With unique hash values, achieved through password salting (where each password has its own random salt added before hashing), even identical passwords will produce different stored hash values. This means that an attacker cannot use a single pre-computed hash to crack multiple accounts, nor can they easily identify common passwords by looking for duplicate hash values. This significantly increases the attacker's effort and reduces the effectiveness of pre-computed hash table attacks."
Compare the effectiveness of high entropy passwords against brute-force attacks versus dictionary attacks.,"High entropy passwords are highly effective against brute-force attacks. By increasing the password length and character set variety, the ""bitsize of password space"" (k) becomes very large, making it computationally infeasible for an attacker to enumerate all possible combinations. However, the document states that ""choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attack. However, hashed passwords, especially for human-generated passwords, are still vulnerable to dictionary attack."" This means that even if a password has high entropy, if it is derived from natural language words or common patterns (as human-generated passwords often are), it can still be susceptible to a dictionary attack. Dictionary attacks do not rely on brute-forcing the entire space but rather on guessing common, human-chosen patterns."
Compare the storage requirements and implications for the salt versus the hash of password+salt.,"When password salting is employed, a unique random string, known as the salt, is generated for each password. This salt is added to the password before hashing. The resulting output is the hash of (password + salt). Both the salt value itself and the hash of (password + salt) are stored. The salt is typically stored in plain text alongside the hash, as its purpose is to be publicly known to be combined with the password for hashing during verification. The hash of (password + salt) is the secure, one-way representation of the password, which is stored to be compared against during login attempts. Storing both ensures that the unique salt is available for re-hashing during authentication and that the pre-computed hash table attacks are mitigated."
Compare the general goal of password storage with specific defense mechanisms like resource-intensive hash algorithms.,"The general goal of password storage is to ensure that passwords are stored in a manner that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the underlying application or database is compromised. This is a broad objective focused on overall security. A specific defense mechanism to achieve this goal, particularly against offline attacks, is the selection of hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This means choosing algorithms that require significant computational power and time to compute a hash, thereby slowing down an attacker's ability to brute force acquired password hashes offline. While the general goal is protection, resource-intensive hashing is a concrete strategy to make offline cracking impractical."
"Compare the ""k x n"" table size for pre-computed hashes with the ""2^n"" hashes for salted passwords (where n is salt bits).","For a pre-computed hash table used in an attack, the table size is 'k × n', where 'k' is the number of password candidates and 'n' is the bit length of each hash. This table stores pre-computed password-hash pairs. In the context of password salting, if a salt of 'n' bits is used, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same password* to account for all possible salt values. This means that instead of a single pre-computed table for all passwords, the attacker would effectively need to generate a separate table for each possible salt value for each password they wish to crack, making the attack significantly more resource-intensive and impractical. The 'k x n' refers to the size of a single, generic pre-computed table, while '2^n' refers to the multiplicative factor of effort introduced by salting for each password."
Compare the speed of a 3GHz PC for cracking with that of ASIC crackers.,"A 3GHz PC, utilizing software password crackers, can crack up to 16 million passwords per second, and is estimated to crack 2^35 complexity within a day. ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster than even specialized hardware like FPGAs, being more than 10 times faster than FPGA crackers. Given that FPGAs can crack 56 bits in 5 days, ASICs would be considerably faster than both FPGAs and general-purpose PCs for their specific cracking tasks."
Compare the vulnerability of human-generated passwords versus machine-generated (high entropy) passwords to dictionary attacks.,"Human-generated passwords are explicitly stated to be vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they ""tend to derive from words in natural languages."" This inherent predictability, even if seemingly complex, allows attackers to guess common words and patterns. Machine-generated passwords, especially those designed for high entropy, are created randomly without relying on natural language or human-predictable patterns. While the document doesn't explicitly state their dictionary attack vulnerability, by definition, truly random, high-entropy passwords would not be found in a dictionary of common words, making them highly resistant to dictionary attacks, in addition to brute-force attacks."
Compare the impact of password policy with the direct impact of increasing password space on brute force attack difficulty.,"Increasing the space of possible passwords, through measures like longer passwords and more symbol varieties, directly makes brute force attacks more difficult by exponentially increasing the number of combinations an attacker must enumerate. A password policy is an important *means* to achieve this. Its impact is indirect, as it enforces the rules that lead to increased password space. For example, a policy requiring 10-character passwords with mixed case and symbols directly results in a much larger password space than a policy allowing 5-character lowercase passwords, thus increasing the difficulty of brute force attacks. So, the policy is the rule, and increased password space is the direct security outcome."
"Compare the concept of ""k"" for password complexity with ""c^n"" for total passwords.","""c^n"" represents the total number of unique passwords possible, given 'c' choices per character and 'n' characters. This is the raw size of the password space. ""k"" is the base-2 logarithm of this number (k = [lg(c^n)]/lg2), and it measures the ""bitsize of password space"" or password entropy. While c^n gives the absolute count, 'k' provides a more intuitive and standardized way to express the strength or complexity of a password in terms of bits. For example, a 5-character lowercase password has c^n = 26^5 possible passwords, and its complexity 'k' is 23.5 bits. 'k' is often used because it scales logarithmically, making large numbers more manageable for comparison."
"Compare the role of ""enumerating all passwords and their hashes"" in a brute force attack with ""guessing commonly used passwords"" in a dictionary attack.","In a brute force attack, ""enumerating all passwords and their hashes"" is the core mechanism. It means systematically generating every single possible password combination, computing its hash, and comparing it to the target hash. This is an exhaustive search. In a dictionary attack, ""guessing commonly used passwords"" is the central strategy. Instead of an exhaustive search, the attacker relies on a pre-compiled list of words, phrases, and common patterns that humans frequently use as passwords. They compute the hashes of these specific guesses and compare them to the target hashes. The former is comprehensive but computationally intensive, while the latter is targeted and exploits human predictability."
Compare the purpose of pre-computing a hash table with the purpose of password salting.,"The purpose of pre-computing a hash table is to facilitate an attack. It is a strategy for cracking hashed passwords by creating a database of password-hash pairs in advance, allowing attackers to quickly look up passwords corresponding to stolen hashes without needing to compute them in real-time. The purpose of password salting, conversely, is to serve as a defense mechanism. It aims to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that use pre-computed hashes. By adding a unique random string (salt) to each password before hashing, salting ensures that even identical passwords produce different hash values, thereby rendering generic pre-computed hash tables useless and forcing attackers to perform individual computations for each salted password."
Provide a specific comparison of the cracking speed of a 3GHz PC and an FPGA hardware cracker based on the document.,"A 3GHz PC, when used with software password crackers, is capable of cracking up to 16 million passwords per second. It is estimated that such a PC can crack a password complexity of 2^35 within a day. In contrast, an FPGA hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits within a period of 5 days. This highlights that while a standard PC can handle a very large number of operations per second for certain complexities, specialized hardware like FPGAs are designed for specific bit-level cracking tasks, potentially offering different performance profiles."
