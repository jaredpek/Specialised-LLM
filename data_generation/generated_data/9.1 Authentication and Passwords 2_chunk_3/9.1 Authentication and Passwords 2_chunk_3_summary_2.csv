Provide a comprehensive summary of a brute force attack against passwords.,"A brute force guessing attack against passwords attempts to discover a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks if any of these generated hashes match the target hashes. This method relies on trying every possible combination until the correct one is found. To counter this, a key measure is to increase the 'space of possible passwords', which means making passwords longer and allowing for a greater variety of symbols, such as alphabets, numerals, and signs. A robust password policy is an important means to increase the difficulties for a brute force attack."
Summarise the key measures to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack.,"The primary measure to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack is to expand the 'space of possible passwords'. This involves using longer passwords and incorporating a wider variety of symbols, including alphabets, numerals, and special signs. By increasing the number of possible combinations, the time and computational resources required for an attacker to enumerate all possibilities grow exponentially. Implementing a strong password policy is crucial for enforcing these measures, thereby making brute force attacks significantly more challenging and time-consuming."
Can you summarise the role of a password policy in mitigating brute force attacks?,"A password policy plays a crucial role in mitigating brute force attacks by increasing the inherent difficulty for attackers. It achieves this by enforcing rules that expand the 'space of possible passwords'. This typically includes requirements for longer passwords and the inclusion of a greater variety of characters, such as alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), numerals, and special signs. By mandating these characteristics, a password policy makes it significantly harder and more time-consuming for an attacker to enumerate all possible password combinations in a brute force attempt."
Explain how a brute force attack utilizes password hashes.,"A brute force attack against passwords utilizes password hashes by generating potential passwords, computing their corresponding hashes, and then comparing these generated hashes against the target hashes. The process involves enumerating all possible passwords in sequence. For each generated password, its hash is calculated. This calculated hash is then checked against the stored target hashes. If a match is found, the attacker has successfully guessed the password. This method relies on the one-way nature of hash functions, where it's easy to compute a hash from a password but computationally infeasible to reverse the process to find the original password from its hash without trying combinations."
What is password entropy and how is it measured?,"Password entropy is a measure of the unpredictability or randomness of a password, indicating the difficulty an attacker would face in guessing it. It is typically measured in 'bitsize', represented as 2^k, where 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. The number of possible passwords for an n-character password, given 'c' choices per character, is c^n. Therefore, 'k' is calculated as log2(c^n) or n * log2(c). A higher 'k' value signifies greater entropy and thus a more secure password."
Summarise the meaning of 'c' and 'n' in the context of password space calculation.,"In the context of password space calculation, 'c' represents the number of unique character choices available for each position in a password, and 'n' represents the length of the password in characters. For example, if a password can only use lowercase alphabets, 'c' would be 26. If it can use lowercase alphabets and numerals, 'c' would be 36. The total number of possible passwords is calculated as c^n. The 'bitsize' of this password space, which is a measure of its complexity, is then derived from this value."
Can you explain how to calculate the complexity (bitsize 'k') of a password given its character set and length?,"To calculate the complexity, or 'bitsize k', of a password, you first determine the total number of possible passwords. This is done by raising the number of available character choices ('c') to the power of the password's length ('n'), resulting in c^n. The 'bitsize k' is then found by solving the equation 2^k = c^n. Mathematically, 'k' is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords, which can be calculated as k = [log(c^n)] / log(2). For instance, for a 5-character lowercase password, 'c' is 26 and 'n' is 5, so the total possibilities are 26^5. The complexity 'k' would be [log(26^5)] / log(2), which equals approximately 23.5 bits."
Provide an example calculation for the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase password.,"For a 5-character lowercase password, the number of character choices ('c') is 26 (representing 'a' through 'z'), and the password length ('n') is 5. The total number of possible passwords is c^n, which is 26^5. To find the complexity or 'bitsize k', we solve 2^k = 26^5. This calculation yields k = [log(26^5)] / log(2), which is approximately 23.5 bits. This means the password space has an entropy equivalent to 23.5 bits."
What is the typical cracking speed of software password crackers on a standard PC?,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pc). This high cracking speed highlights the importance of strong password policies and robust hashing algorithms to protect against rapid offline attacks."
How long would it take a 3GHz PC to crack a password with 2^35 complexity?,"A password with 2^35 complexity can be cracked within approximately one day on a 3GHz PC. This is considered a generous estimate, indicating that even moderately complex passwords can be compromised relatively quickly with current computing power."
Summarise the cracking capabilities of FPGA and ASIC hardware crackers.,"FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware crackers are capable of cracking passwords with a complexity of 56 bits within approximately 5 days. ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are even more powerful, being more than 10 times faster than FPGAs. This demonstrates that specialized hardware significantly accelerates password cracking compared to general-purpose CPUs, making high-entropy passwords and strong hashing algorithms even more critical."
What does Table 10.1 illustrate regarding password entropy?,"Table 10.1 illustrates the 'bitsize' of password space for various character combinations, which is a direct measure of password entropy. It shows how the complexity ('k' in 2^k) changes based on the password length ('n') and the number of character choices ('c'). The table provides the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords (c^n) for different scenarios, such as lowercase, lowercase alphanumeric, mixed case alphanumeric, and keyboard characters, across varying lengths from 5 to 10 characters. This demonstrates how increasing password length and character set significantly increases the entropy and thus the security of a password."
What is the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password according to Table 10.1?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password is 25.9 bits. This value represents the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords when using 36 character choices (26 lowercase letters + 10 numerals) for a length of 5 characters."
What is the bitsize for a 10-character password using keyboard characters?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 10-character password using keyboard characters is 65.7 bits. This value reflects the significantly larger password space when both the length and the variety of character choices (95 keyboard characters) are maximized."
How does increasing password length from 5 to 6 characters impact the bitsize for lowercase passwords?,"According to Table 10.1, increasing the password length from 5 to 6 characters for lowercase passwords significantly increases the bitsize. For 5-character lowercase, the bitsize is 23.5 bits. For 6-character lowercase, it increases to 28.2 bits. This demonstrates that even a small increase in password length can lead to a substantial increase in password entropy and, consequently, security."
Compare the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase password with a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password.,"Comparing the bitsize of a 5-character lowercase password with a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password reveals a significant difference in entropy. According to Table 10.1, a 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5 bits. In contrast, a 5-character mixed case alphanumeric password, which uses a larger character set (62 choices), has a bitsize of 29.8 bits. This illustrates that expanding the character set, even for the same password length, substantially increases the password's complexity and resistance to attack."
What is a dictionary attack and how does it differ from a brute force attack?,"A dictionary attack is a method of cracking passwords that exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which often derive from words in natural languages. Unlike a brute force attack, which enumerates all possible combinations, a dictionary attack focuses on guessing commonly used passwords, words found in dictionaries, or variations thereof. The attacker computes the hash values of these guessed passwords and then looks for matches against the stored hash values in a password file. While high entropy passwords can prevent brute-force attacks, hashed passwords, especially human-generated ones, remain vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they often lack true randomness."
Explain why passwords with high entropy might still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks.,"Passwords with high entropy are effective at preventing brute-force attacks because they make it computationally infeasible to guess all possible combinations. However, even hashed passwords, particularly those chosen by humans, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks. This vulnerability arises because human-chosen passwords often tend to derive from words in natural languages, common phrases, or easily guessable patterns, even if they include some special characters or numbers. A dictionary attack exploits this weakness by pre-computing hashes of commonly used words and their variations, rather than trying every single character combination, making it possible to crack passwords that might appear complex but are actually based on predictable linguistic patterns."
Summarise the steps an attacker would take to perform a dictionary attack.,"To perform a dictionary attack, an attacker typically follows these steps: First, they guess a list of commonly used passwords, which can include words from dictionaries, common phrases, or known weak password patterns. Second, for each of these guessed passwords, they compute its hash value using the same hashing algorithm as the target system. Third, they compare these computed hash values against the hash values stored in the compromised password file. If a computed hash matches a stored hash, the attacker has successfully identified the corresponding password."
What is the implication of multiple users having the same password in the context of a dictionary attack?,"The implication of multiple users having the same password in the context of a dictionary attack is that they will all have the same hash value stored in the password file. This makes the dictionary attack highly efficient. If an attacker successfully guesses a common password and computes its hash, they can then quickly identify all accounts that use that same password by simply looking for matching hash values in the compromised password file. This significantly amplifies the impact of a single successful guess."
Describe the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking hashed passwords.,"The strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking hashed passwords involves creating a large database that contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values in advance. This table is built offline, before an attack. When an attacker obtains a set of hashed passwords, they can then quickly look up these hashes in their pre-computed table to find the original plaintext passwords. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table would be of size k × n. However, this strategy may not be practical if 'k' (the number of password candidates) is very large, as the storage requirements for the hash table would become immense."
What are the practicality concerns associated with pre-computed hash tables?,"The primary practicality concern associated with pre-computed hash tables is their size. If the number of password candidates ('k') is very large, the resulting hash table, which stores 'k' password-hash pairs where each hash has 'n' bits, would be of size k × n. Such a large table would require immense storage capacity, making it impractical to generate, store, and manage. This limitation restricts the effectiveness of pre-computed hash tables to password spaces that are not excessively large."
Summarise the purpose and mechanism of password salting.,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks, particularly those involving pre-computed hashes like rainbow tables. Its purpose is to ensure that identical passwords result in different stored hash values. The mechanism involves adding a 'salt' – which is a random string – to a password *before* applying the hash function. Each password is assigned its own unique salt. This salt value is then stored alongside the hash of the password+salt combination. For an attacker, this means that instead of pre-computing hashes for common passwords once, they would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password for an n-bit salt, making pre-computation for a large number of passwords infeasible."
Explain how salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes.,"Salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes by ensuring that even identical passwords produce unique hash values. A 'salt', which is a random string, is added to a password *before* it is hashed. Since each password has its own unique salt, the resulting hash for 'passwordA' with 'salt1' will be different from 'passwordA' with 'salt2'. The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This forces an attacker attempting to use a pre-computed hash table (like a rainbow table) to generate a separate pre-computed table for every possible salt value, or, for a salt of 'n' bits, to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password. This makes the pre-computation effort astronomically large and impractical, effectively neutralizing the advantage of pre-computed hash tables."
"What is a 'salt' in the context of password security, and how is it stored?","In the context of password security, a 'salt' is a random string that is added to a password before it is subjected to a hash function. Its primary purpose is to ensure that identical passwords produce different hash values, thereby mitigating the effectiveness of pre-computed hash attacks. Each password is assigned its own unique salt. The salt value is stored alongside the resulting hash of the password combined with its salt (password+salt). This allows the system to retrieve the salt when verifying a password, combine it with the user's input, and then hash the combination for comparison."
Summarise the key considerations for secure password storage.,"For secure password storage, it is essential to store passwords in a manner that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database itself is compromised. Defenders must acknowledge that once an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they will always be able to brute force these hashes offline. Therefore, the primary strategy for a defender is to slow down these offline attacks as much as possible. This is achieved by selecting hash algorithms that are deliberately resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and time to process, thereby increasing the cost and time for an attacker to crack passwords."
What is the defender's primary strategy to slow down offline password attacks?,"The defender's primary strategy to slow down offline password attacks is to select and implement hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This means choosing algorithms that require significant computational power, memory, or time to execute. By doing so, even if an attacker acquires the stored password hashes, the process of brute-forcing or dictionary-attacking them offline becomes prohibitively slow and costly, increasing the time required to crack passwords and providing a window for detection and mitigation."
Explain the importance of secure password storage even if an application or database is compromised.,"It is essential to store passwords securely even if an application or database is compromised because attackers, once they acquire stored password hashes, are always able to brute force these hashes offline. A compromise of the application or database means the hashes are exposed. Without secure storage practices, such as using strong, resource-intensive hashing algorithms and salting, the compromised hashes can be quickly cracked, leading to widespread account compromise. Secure storage aims to make the post-compromise cracking process as difficult and time-consuming as possible, buying time for defensive measures."
Compare and contrast brute force attacks and dictionary attacks.,"Brute force attacks and dictionary attacks are both methods for cracking passwords, but they differ in their approach. A **brute force attack** attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating *all* possible password combinations and their hashes until a match is found. It is exhaustive but can be very time-consuming for complex passwords. A **dictionary attack**, on the other hand, exploits the human tendency to choose predictable passwords. It works by guessing commonly used passwords, words from dictionaries, or variations thereof, computing their hashes, and checking for matches. While high-entropy passwords prevent brute force, human-chosen passwords, even if seemingly complex, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks if they are based on natural language words. Both attacks involve computing hashes and comparing them to target hashes, but dictionary attacks are more targeted and less exhaustive."
Summarise the overall challenge of password security from both attacker and defender perspectives.,"From an attacker's perspective, the challenge of password security involves efficiently discovering passwords, often by exploiting computational power (brute force) or human predictability (dictionary attacks). Attackers aim to acquire password hashes and then crack them offline, leveraging techniques like pre-computed hash tables. From a defender's perspective, the overall challenge is to store passwords in a way that prevents their compromise, even if the system is breached. Defenders must acknowledge that offline cracking is always possible once hashes are acquired. Their strategy focuses on slowing down these offline attacks by enforcing strong password policies (longer, varied characters), using resource-intensive hashing algorithms, and employing techniques like salting to make pre-computation impractical and increase the computational cost for attackers."
Can you summarise the methods to increase password security discussed in the document?,"The document discusses several methods to increase password security. Firstly, increasing the 'space of possible passwords' by using longer passwords and a greater variety of symbols (alphabets, numerals, signs) makes brute force attacks more difficult. This is enforced through strong password policies. Secondly, employing password salting is crucial; a random string (salt) is added to each password before hashing, and this salt is stored with the hash. This prevents pre-computed hash attacks by ensuring unique hashes for identical passwords. Lastly, as a defender, it is essential to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. These algorithms deliberately consume significant computational resources, thereby slowing down offline brute force attacks even if hashes are compromised."
"Discuss the role of hardware in password cracking, including different types of crackers.","Hardware plays a significant role in accelerating password cracking. While software password crackers on standard PCs can achieve speeds of up to 16 million passwords per second, specialized hardware offers even greater efficiency. FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware crackers, for instance, can crack 56-bit complexity within 5 days. ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are even more potent, being more than 10 times faster than FPGAs. This demonstrates that dedicated hardware, designed for high-speed cryptographic operations, can drastically reduce the time required to crack passwords, making it imperative to implement robust password security measures that account for such advanced cracking capabilities."
Explain the concept of password complexity and its measurement using 'bitsize'.,"Password complexity refers to the difficulty an attacker would face in guessing or cracking a password. It is directly related to the password's entropy, which quantifies its unpredictability. This complexity is measured using 'bitsize', denoted as 'k', where the total number of possible passwords is 2^k. The 'bitsize k' is calculated as the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords (c^n), where 'c' is the number of available character choices and 'n' is the password length. A higher 'bitsize k' indicates a more complex and secure password because it means there are exponentially more combinations an attacker would need to try, making brute force attacks computationally more expensive and time-consuming."
What is the bitsize for a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password is 41.7 bits. This value reflects the increased complexity due to both the longer password length and the larger character set (62 choices: uppercase, lowercase, and numerals)."
What is the bitsize for an 8-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for an 8-character lowercase alphanumeric password is 41.4 bits. This value is derived from using 36 character choices (lowercase letters and numerals) for a password length of 8 characters."
How does increasing the character set from lowercase to lowercase alphanumeric impact the bitsize for a 5-character password?,"According to Table 10.1, increasing the character set from lowercase (26 choices) to lowercase alphanumeric (36 choices) for a 5-character password significantly impacts the bitsize. A 5-character lowercase password has a bitsize of 23.5 bits. In contrast, a 5-character lowercase alphanumeric password has a bitsize of 25.9 bits. This demonstrates that even for the same length, expanding the pool of available characters increases the password's entropy and security."
What is the definition of 'k' in the context of a pre-computed hash table?,"In the context of a pre-computed hash table, 'k' represents the number of password candidates for which hash values have been pre-computed. The hash table stores pairs of these 'k' password candidates and their corresponding hashes. If 'k' is very large, the size of the hash table (k × n, where 'n' is the hash bit length) becomes impractical, limiting the effectiveness of this cracking strategy."
What is the definition of 'n' in the context of a pre-computed hash table?,"In the context of a pre-computed hash table, 'n' represents the bit length of each hash. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, then the total size of the pre-computed hash table would be k × n. This 'n' value contributes to the overall storage requirement for the table, which can become impractical if 'k' is large."
When is a salt added to a password during the hashing process?,"A salt is added to a password *before* applying the hash function. This means the password and its unique random salt are concatenated or combined in some way, and then this combined string is fed into the hashing algorithm. This ensures that the resulting hash is unique even if the original password is the same for different users."
What is the attacker's challenge when an n-bit salt is used with passwords?,"When an n-bit salt is used with passwords, the attacker's challenge significantly increases. For each password, a unique n-bit salt is added before hashing. This means that to crack a specific password, the attacker cannot simply use a single pre-computed hash table. Instead, for the *same* password, the attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n different hashes, one for each possible salt value. This makes pre-computation for a large number of passwords and their potential salts computationally infeasible, effectively neutralizing the advantage of pre-computed hash attacks."
Describe the illustration of password salting provided.,"The illustration of password salting shows a clear process. It starts with a plaintext password, for example, 'hello'. A step labeled 'add salt' takes place, combining 'hello' with a salt, resulting in 'hello3ab9'. This combined string is then fed into a 'hash function', which produces a hash value, such as '39e19b234...'. Finally, this hash value and the original salt are stored together, indicated by 'store hash and salt'. This visualizes how a random string (salt) is incorporated before hashing to produce a unique hash, which is then stored along with its corresponding salt."
What happens to stored password hashes if an attacker acquires them offline?,"If an attacker acquires stored password hashes offline, they are always able to brute force these hashes. This means the attacker can use their own computational resources, without needing access to the live system, to systematically try to guess the original passwords that correspond to the acquired hashes. The success and speed of this offline brute-forcing depend on the strength of the original passwords and the resource-intensiveness of the hashing algorithms used."
What is the bitsize for a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 6-character mixed case alphanumeric password is 35.7 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 9-character lowercase alphanumeric password is 46.5 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 10-character lowercase password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 10-character lowercase password is 47.0 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 7-character lowercase alphanumeric password is 36.2 bits."
What is the bitsize for an 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for an 8-character mixed case alphanumeric password is 47.6 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 9-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 9-character mixed case alphanumeric password is 53.6 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 10-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 10-character mixed case alphanumeric password is 59.5 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 6-character keyboard characters password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 6-character keyboard characters password is 39.4 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 7-character keyboard characters password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 7-character keyboard characters password is 46.0 bits."
What is the bitsize for an 8-character keyboard characters password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for an 8-character keyboard characters password is 52.6 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 9-character keyboard characters password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 9-character keyboard characters password is 59.1 bits."
What is the bitsize for a 5-character keyboard characters password?,"According to Table 10.1, the bitsize for a 5-character keyboard characters password is 32.9 bits."
How does the number of character choices ('c') affect the total number of possible passwords?,"The number of character choices ('c') has a direct and exponential effect on the total number of possible passwords. Given a password length 'n', the total number of possible passwords is c^n. This means that even a small increase in 'c' can lead to a significantly larger password space, thereby increasing the password's entropy and making it much harder to guess or brute force."
What is the relationship between password length ('n') and the total number of possible passwords?,"The password length ('n') has an exponential relationship with the total number of possible passwords. Given 'c' character choices, the total number of possible passwords is c^n. This means that increasing the password length by just one character multiplies the total possibilities by 'c'. Consequently, longer passwords exponentially increase the password space, making them significantly more resistant to brute force attacks."
What is the primary goal of secure password storage?,"The primary goal of secure password storage is to prevent passwords from being obtained by an attacker, even in the event that the application or database storing them is compromised. This involves implementing measures that make it extremely difficult and time-consuming for an attacker to recover the original plaintext passwords from their stored hashed forms, thereby protecting user accounts."
