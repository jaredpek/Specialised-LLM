Analyse the concept of a brute force attack against passwords.,A brute force guessing attack against passwords attempts to guess a password by systematically enumerating all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes in sequence. The attacker then checks if any of these generated hashes match the target hashes. This method relies on trying every possible combination until the correct password is found.
What measures can be taken to increase the difficulty of a brute force attack?,"To increase the difficulty of a brute force attack, one primary measure is to expand the space of possible passwords. This can be achieved by using longer passwords and allowing a greater variety of symbols, including alphabets, numerals, and signs. A robust password policy is an important means to implement these measures, making it harder for attackers to guess passwords through exhaustive enumeration."
Explain the role of password policy in mitigating brute force attacks.,"Password policy serves as an important means to increase the difficulties of a brute force attack. By enforcing policies that require longer passwords and a greater variety of characters (such as alphabets, numerals, and signs), the policy effectively increases the space of possible passwords. A larger password space means an attacker needs to enumerate significantly more combinations, thereby making brute force attacks more time-consuming and computationally intensive."
"How is password entropy measured, and what does the 'k' value represent?","Password entropy is measured by 2^k, where 'k' represents the bitsize of the password space. The bitsize is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. For 'n' character passwords with 'c' choices per character, the total number of possible passwords is c^n, and thus k = log2(c^n). A higher 'k' value indicates greater entropy and a larger, more complex password space, making it harder to crack."
Calculate the number of possible passwords and their complexity (k value) for a 5-character lowercase password.,"For a 5-character lowercase password, there are 26 possible choices for each character (alphabets). Therefore, the total number of possible passwords is 26^5. To find the complexity, or 'k' value, we solve 2^k = 26^5. This results in k = [log2(26^5)] = 23.5. This 'k' value represents the bitsize of the password space."
Analyze the bitsize of password space for a 10-character lowercase alphanumeric password based on Table 10.1.,"According to Table 10.1, for a 10-character password ('n' = 10) using lowercase alphanumeric characters ('c' = 36), the bitsize of the password space is 51.7. This 'k' value indicates that there are 2^51.7 possible passwords, reflecting the complexity and resistance to brute-force attacks for such a password."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 7-character mixed case alphanumeric password?,"Based on Table 10.1, for a 7-character password ('n' = 7) using mixed case alphanumeric characters ('c' = 62), the bitsize of the password space is 41.7. This means there are 2^41.7 possible passwords, indicating the level of complexity and the effort required for a brute-force attack."
Compare the bitsize of password space for 5-character lowercase passwords versus 5-character keyboard characters.,"For 5-character lowercase passwords, the bitsize of the password space is 23.5. In contrast, for 5-character passwords using keyboard characters, the bitsize is 32.9. This comparison shows that using a wider variety of characters (keyboard characters, c=95) significantly increases the password space and thus its complexity (k value) compared to using only lowercase characters (c=26) for the same password length."
Describe the cracking speed capabilities of software password crackers.,"At present, software password crackers can crack up to 16 million passwords per second per personal computer (pswd/sec per pc). This speed highlights the efficiency of these tools in attempting to guess passwords, especially those with lower entropy or shorter lengths."
How long would it take a 3GHz PC to crack a password with 2^35 complexity?,"A password with 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day on a 3GHz PC. This is considered a generous estimate, indicating that even moderately complex passwords can be compromised relatively quickly with modern computing power."
Compare the cracking capabilities of FPGA hardware crackers and ASIC crackers.,"An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) hardware cracker can crack 56 bits within 5 days (estimated). ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are significantly faster, being more than 10 times faster than FPGA crackers. This demonstrates a hierarchy of cracking efficiency, with ASICs offering the highest performance for password cracking tasks."
What do 'c' and 'n' represent in the context of password space calculation?,"In the context of password space calculation, 'n' represents the number of characters in the password, also known as the password length. 'c' represents the number of choices available per character, which refers to the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase alphabets, 95 for keyboard characters). The total number of possible passwords is calculated as c^n."
Define 'bitsize of password space'.,"The 'bitsize of password space', denoted as 'k', is the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possible passwords. It quantifies the entropy or complexity of a password. For 'n' character passwords with 'c' choices per character, the bitsize 'k' is calculated as log2(c^n). A higher bitsize indicates a larger and more secure password space."
Provide the bitsize for a 9-character password using keyboard characters.,"According to Table 10.1, for a 9-character password ('n' = 9) using keyboard characters ('c' = 95), the bitsize of the password space is 59.1. This indicates a high level of complexity, meaning there are 2^59.1 possible passwords."
Explain what a dictionary attack is.,"A dictionary attack is a type of password cracking method that exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords. It involves guessing commonly used passwords, which often derive from words in natural languages. Attackers compute the hash values of these guessed passwords and then look for matching hash values in a compromised password file."
How do dictionary attacks exploit weaknesses in human-chosen passwords?,"Dictionary attacks exploit the inherent weakness in human-chosen passwords, which tend to be derived from words found in natural languages or are commonly used phrases. Even if passwords have high entropy, if they are human-generated and based on predictable patterns or dictionary words, they remain vulnerable. The attack leverages this predictability by trying a predefined list of common words and phrases."
Describe the steps involved in a dictionary attack.,"A dictionary attack involves three main steps: First, the attacker guesses some commonly used passwords, often from a pre-compiled list or 'dictionary'. Second, they compute the hash values for each of these guessed passwords. Third, they compare these computed hash values against the stored hash values in a compromised password file, looking for a match to identify the original password."
Why are hashed passwords still vulnerable to dictionary attacks despite high entropy?,"Hashed passwords, especially those that are human-generated, are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks even if they appear to have high entropy. This vulnerability arises because humans often choose passwords that are words or combinations of words from natural languages, or common patterns. A dictionary attack exploits this by trying a list of such common words and their hashes, rather than enumerating all possible character combinations as in a brute-force attack."
What is the relationship between high entropy passwords and dictionary attacks?,"While choosing passwords with high entropy generally prevents brute-force attacks by making the password space too large to exhaustively search, it does not inherently prevent dictionary attacks. Hashed passwords, particularly human-generated ones, can still be vulnerable to dictionary attacks if the high-entropy password is, in fact, a word or a common phrase found in a dictionary. Dictionary attacks exploit the linguistic patterns of human-chosen passwords rather than their mathematical entropy."
Describe the strategy of using a pre-computed hash table for cracking passwords.,"A strategy for cracking hashed passwords involves using a pre-computed hash table. This table contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values. Attackers can generate this table offline and then, when they acquire a target hash, they can quickly look up the hash in their pre-computed table to find the original password, bypassing the need to compute hashes in real-time for each guess."
What does a pre-computed hash table contain?,"A pre-computed hash table contains pairs of passwords and their corresponding hash values. Essentially, it's a lookup table where an attacker can find a password if they have its hash, by matching the acquired hash with one of the pre-computed hashes in the table."
What factors make a pre-computed hash table impractical?,"A pre-computed hash table can become impractical if the number of password candidates, denoted as 'k', is very large. If there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table would be of size 'k x n'. A large 'k' would result in an extremely large table, requiring immense storage capacity and making it difficult to manage and search efficiently."
How is the size of a pre-computed hash table determined?,"The size of a pre-computed hash table is determined by the number of password candidates ('k') and the bit length of each hash ('n'). Specifically, if there are 'k' password candidates and each hash has 'n' bits, the table will have a size of 'k x n'. This size can become impractical if 'k' is large."
What is the primary purpose of a pre-computed hash table in password cracking?,"The primary purpose of a pre-computed hash table in password cracking is to accelerate the process of finding original passwords from their hashes. By having a ready-made lookup table of password-hash pairs, an attacker can quickly identify a password by matching a compromised hash against the pre-computed entries, rather than having to compute hashes for each guess in real-time."
Explain the concept of password salting.,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that rely on pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, random string, known as a 'salt', to a password before applying the hash function. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hash values will be different because a unique salt is appended to each password before hashing."
What is the purpose of adding a salt to a password?,"The purpose of adding a salt to a password is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks, particularly those using pre-computed hashes like rainbow tables. By adding a unique random string (salt) to each password before hashing, it ensures that identical passwords will produce different hash values, making it impossible to use a single pre-computed hash table to crack multiple passwords or to detect duplicate passwords."
How is a salt defined in the context of password security?,"In the context of password security, a salt is defined as a random string that is added to a password before the hashing function is applied. It is unique for each password, meaning every password has its own salt. This randomness and uniqueness are crucial for enhancing security against pre-computed hash attacks."
Where is the salt value stored in a password system?,"The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This means that when a user's password is hashed, the resulting hash (which incorporates the salt) and the salt itself are stored together. When verifying a password, the stored salt is retrieved, combined with the entered password, and then hashed for comparison."
How does salting impact an attacker's ability to use pre-computed hashes?,"Salting significantly impacts an attacker's ability to use pre-computed hashes because each password has its own unique salt. This means that an attacker cannot use a single pre-computed hash table (like a rainbow table) to crack multiple passwords, even if those passwords are identical. Instead, for a salt of 'n' bits, the attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same* password, effectively requiring a new pre-computation for every unique salt-password combination, which is computationally prohibitive."
What is the implication of each password having its own salt?,"The implication of each password having its own salt is that even if multiple users choose the exact same password, their stored hash values will be different. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to crack multiple passwords simultaneously or to identify users who share common passwords, as each unique salt-password combination generates a unique hash."
"If a salt has 'n' bits, how many hashes does an attacker need to pre-compute for the same password?","If a salt has 'n' bits, an attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password. This is because the salt is a random string, and to account for all possible salt values for a given password, the attacker would theoretically need to generate a hash for that password combined with every possible 'n'-bit salt."
Describe the process of password salting with an example from the illustration.,"The illustration shows a password 'hello' being processed. First, a 'salt' (e.g., '3ab9') is added to the password, forming 'hello3ab9'. This combined string is then passed through a 'hash function', which produces a hash value (e.g., '39e19b234...'). Finally, both the resulting hash and the original salt are stored. This process ensures that the hash stored is unique even if the original password 'hello' is used by other users with different salts."
How does salting reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks?,"Salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks by making pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) largely useless. Since a unique random salt is added to each password before hashing, the same password will produce different hash values for different users. This forces an attacker to generate a new pre-computed table for each individual password-salt combination, which is computationally infeasible for a large number of users or sufficiently long salts, thus slowing down or preventing offline cracking."
What is the key difference between a salted hash and an unsalted hash from an attacker's perspective?,"From an attacker's perspective, the key difference is that an unsalted hash allows for the use of generic pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to crack multiple identical passwords simultaneously. A salted hash, however, requires the attacker to either generate a unique pre-computed table for each specific salt-password combination or to perform a brute-force attack on each individual hash, effectively negating the efficiency gains of pre-computation and significantly increasing the cracking effort."
Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. This is because once an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force those hashes offline. Secure storage is the first line of defense to prevent the initial acquisition of these hashes."
What is the consequence if an attacker acquires stored password hashes?,"If an attacker acquires stored password hashes, the consequence is that they are always able to brute force those hashes offline. This means they can take their time, using their own computing resources, to try and crack the original passwords without being detected by the target system, potentially compromising user accounts."
"As a defender, what is the primary strategy to slow down offline attacks?","As a defender, the primary strategy to slow down offline attacks is to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This makes the process of computing hashes (and thus brute-forcing them) computationally expensive and time-consuming for an attacker, even with powerful hardware, thereby increasing the time required to crack passwords."
What kind of hash algorithms should defenders select for password storage?,"Defenders should select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible for password storage. This means choosing algorithms that require significant computational power and time to execute, making it more difficult and slower for attackers to perform offline brute-force attacks on acquired password hashes."
Can offline brute force attacks on acquired hashes be entirely prevented?,"No, offline brute force attacks on acquired hashes cannot be entirely prevented. Once an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to attempt to brute force them offline. As a defender, the goal is not prevention but rather to slow down these attacks as much as possible by using resource-intensive hash algorithms."
Compare and contrast brute force attacks and dictionary attacks.,"Brute force attacks attempt to guess a password by enumerating all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence, relying on exhaustive search. Dictionary attacks, on the other hand, exploit weaknesses in human-chosen passwords by guessing commonly used words or phrases from natural languages. While brute force is comprehensive but slow for complex passwords, dictionary attacks are faster but limited to predictable passwords. High entropy helps against brute force but not necessarily against dictionary attacks if the password is a common word."
How do password policies contribute to both brute force and dictionary attack resistance?,"Password policies contribute to brute force resistance by requiring longer passwords and a greater variety of characters (alphabets, numerals, signs), which increases the space of possible passwords. For dictionary attack resistance, policies can discourage the use of common words or easily guessable patterns, although human-chosen passwords can still be vulnerable. Combining strong character requirements with guidance against dictionary words enhances overall resistance."
Explain how password entropy relates to the difficulty of a brute force attack.,"Password entropy, measured by 2^k (where 'k' is the bitsize of the password space), directly relates to the difficulty of a brute force attack. A higher 'k' value signifies a larger number of possible password combinations (c^n). A larger password space means an attacker must perform more guesses to find the correct password, thus increasing the time and computational resources required for a brute force attack, making it more difficult."
Discuss the limitations of pre-computed hash tables and how salting addresses some of these limitations.,"Pre-computed hash tables are limited by their impractical size ('k x n' where 'k' is the number of candidates and 'n' is hash bits) when 'k' is large, making them difficult to store and manage. They are also highly effective against unsalted hashes, allowing attackers to quickly find passwords. Salting addresses these limitations by adding a unique random string (salt) to each password before hashing. This ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes, rendering generic pre-computed tables useless and forcing attackers to pre-compute 2^n hashes for each specific password-salt combination, which is computationally prohibitive."
Summarize the overall approach to secure password storage based on the provided information.,"The overall approach to secure password storage involves several layers of defense. Firstly, it's essential to store passwords in a way that prevents their initial acquisition, even if the system is compromised. Secondly, to mitigate offline attacks on acquired hashes, defenders must select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible to slow down brute-force attempts. Thirdly, password salting is crucial: a unique random salt is added to each password before hashing, and both the hash and salt are stored. This prevents the use of pre-computed hash tables and ensures identical passwords yield different hashes, significantly increasing the attacker's effort."
What is the estimated cracking time for 56 bits using an FPGA hardware cracker?,An FPGA hardware cracker is estimated to crack 56 bits within 5 days. This provides a benchmark for the performance of specialized hardware in breaking password complexities.
How much faster are ASIC crackers compared to FPGA crackers?,ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) crackers are more than 10 times faster than FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) crackers. This significant speed advantage makes ASICs highly efficient for password cracking operations.
What is the maximum bitsize of password space for a 10-character password using keyboard characters according to Table 10.1?,"According to Table 10.1, the maximum bitsize of password space for a 10-character password ('n' = 10) using keyboard characters ('c' = 95) is 65.7. This represents the highest complexity listed in the table for a 10-character password, indicating a very large number of possible combinations (2^65.7)."
Explain why human-generated passwords are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks even with high entropy.,"Human-generated passwords are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks because they often derive from words in natural languages or common patterns, even if they appear to have high entropy. A dictionary attack exploits this tendency by trying a list of known words and phrases, which can succeed even against passwords that would be difficult to brute-force due to their length or character variety, but are nonetheless predictable in their construction."
What is the primary goal of a defender in the context of offline password attacks?,"The primary goal of a defender in the context of offline password attacks is to slow down these attacks as much as possible. Since it's not possible to entirely prevent an attacker from brute-forcing acquired hashes offline, the strategy focuses on making the cracking process computationally intensive and time-consuming by selecting resource-intensive hash algorithms."
How does increasing the variety of symbols in a password affect its resistance to brute force attacks?,"Increasing the variety of symbols in a password, such as including alphabets, numerals, and signs, directly increases the 'c' (choices per character) value. This expansion of the character set significantly enlarges the space of possible passwords (c^n), thereby increasing the password's entropy ('k' value) and making it much more difficult and time-consuming for a brute force attack to succeed."
What is the significance of the '2^k' notation in password entropy?,"The '2^k' notation in password entropy signifies the total number of possible passwords in the password space. 'k' represents the bitsize of this space, which is the base-2 logarithm of the number of possible passwords. This notation provides a standardized way to quantify the complexity and strength of a password, where a higher 'k' value indicates a larger and more secure password space."
"Can a 2^35 complexity password be cracked by an FPGA hardware cracker, and if so, how long would it take?","The document states that 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day on a 3GHz PC. While an FPGA hardware cracker can crack 56 bits within 5 days, it does not directly specify the time for 2^35 complexity using an FPGA. However, since 35 bits is less than 56 bits, it implies an FPGA could crack it, likely faster than 5 days, but the exact time for 2^35 by an FPGA is not provided, only for a 3GHz PC."
"What is the minimum bitsize for a 5-character password shown in Table 10.1, and what character set does it correspond to?","The minimum bitsize for a 5-character password shown in Table 10.1 is 23.5. This corresponds to passwords composed solely of lowercase characters, which has the smallest character set ('c' = 26) among the options provided for a given length."
Explain why storing the salt value along with the hash of password+salt is necessary.,"Storing the salt value along with the hash of password+salt is necessary because the salt is a random string unique to each password. When a user attempts to log in, the system needs the specific salt that was used during the original hashing of their password. This stored salt is then combined with the entered password, hashed, and the result is compared to the stored hash to verify authenticity. Without the stored salt, the system would not be able to correctly re-hash the entered password for verification."
What is the impact of using a fixed salt for all passwords versus a unique salt for each password?,"The document implies that 'each password has its own salt'. If a fixed salt were used for all passwords, it would negate many of the benefits of salting. A fixed salt would allow attackers to create a single pre-computed hash table for that specific salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks similar to unsalted hashes. Using a unique salt for each password ensures that identical passwords produce different hashes, making pre-computation for multiple passwords infeasible and significantly increasing the attacker's effort."
How does the number of characters ('n') in a password influence its bitsize of password space?,"The number of characters ('n') in a password significantly influences its bitsize of password space. As 'n' increases, the total number of possible passwords (c^n) grows exponentially, where 'c' is the number of choices per character. This exponential growth directly leads to a larger bitsize ('k' = log2(c^n)), making the password much more complex and resistant to brute force attacks."
What is the primary vulnerability that password salting aims to address?,"The primary vulnerability that password salting aims to address is the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes, such as rainbow tables. These attacks rely on the fact that identical passwords produce identical hashes. By adding a unique random salt to each password before hashing, salting ensures that even identical passwords result in different stored hashes, thereby rendering generic pre-computed hash tables ineffective."
Why is it important for hash algorithms used for password storage to be resource-intensive?,"It is important for hash algorithms used for password storage to be resource-intensive because this slows down offline attacks. When an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they will attempt to brute force them. By using resource-intensive algorithms, the computational cost and time required for the attacker to perform each hash calculation are significantly increased, thereby slowing down the overall cracking process and buying more time for detection or mitigation."
What kind of passwords are most susceptible to dictionary attacks?,"Passwords that are most susceptible to dictionary attacks are human-chosen passwords that tend to derive from words in natural languages or are commonly used phrases. These include simple words, names, common number sequences, or combinations that can be found in a dictionary or a list of frequently used passwords, even if they might seem long enough to resist simple brute-force."
How does the concept of 'c choices per character' relate to password strength?,"The concept of 'c choices per character' directly relates to password strength by defining the size of the character set available for each position in a password. A larger 'c' (e.g., using mixed case alphanumeric characters and signs) means more possible characters for each position, which exponentially increases the total number of possible passwords (c^n) for a given length 'n'. This, in turn, leads to a higher bitsize of password space ('k'), making the password significantly stronger and more resistant to brute force attacks."
What is the estimated time to crack 2^35 complexity on a 3GHz PC?,"It is estimated that 2^35 complexity can be cracked within a day on a 3GHz PC. This is considered a generous estimate, highlighting the speed at which modern personal computers can handle password cracking tasks for moderately complex passwords."
What is the implication of 'Users with same password will have same hash value stored in password file' in the context of dictionary attacks?,"The implication of 'Users with same password will have same hash value stored in password file' is a critical vulnerability that dictionary attacks exploit. If multiple users choose the same password, their stored hash values will be identical (assuming no salting). An attacker can then compute the hash of a common dictionary word once and, if it matches, identify all users who used that same password, making the attack highly efficient against widespread weak passwords."
How does the 'add salt' step in password salting prevent the use of pre-computed hashes?,"The 'add salt' step in password salting prevents the use of pre-computed hashes by ensuring that a unique, random string is appended to each password before it is hashed. This means that even if the original passwords are identical, the input to the hash function (password + salt) will be different for each user, resulting in unique hash values. Consequently, a pre-computed table built for one salt-password combination will not work for another, forcing attackers to generate a new table for every unique salt, which is computationally infeasible."
What is the primary defense against an attacker who has already acquired stored password hashes?,"The primary defense against an attacker who has already acquired stored password hashes is to slow down their offline brute-force attempts as much as possible. This is achieved by selecting hash algorithms that are highly resource-intensive, making each hash calculation computationally expensive. Additionally, the use of unique salts for each password ensures that pre-computed hash tables are ineffective, forcing the attacker to work on each hash individually."
What is the bitsize of password space for a 6-character lowercase alphanumeric password?,"According to Table 10.1, for a 6-character password ('n' = 6) using lowercase alphanumeric characters ('c' = 36), the bitsize of the password space is 31.0. This indicates that there are 2^31.0 possible passwords for this combination."
How does the 'MATCH' concept relate to brute force attacks?,"In the context of brute force attacks, 'MATCH' refers to the crucial step where the hash of a guessed password is compared against the target hash. If they match, the attacker has successfully identified the correct password. The entire brute force process is an iterative attempt to find this match by enumerating all possible password and hash combinations."
