In the context of the Workstation A breach, this phase was completed by 1 December 2017, with the installation of tools like the public hacking tool and RAT 1. The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, from initial reconnaissance to the attacker's objective."
Define the 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involves the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised system and issue commands. In the context of the Workstation A breach, this phase was completed by 1 December 2017, enabling the attacker to execute shell scripts and transfer files. The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, from initial reconnaissance to the attacker's objective."
"What are ""shell scripts"" and how were they relevant to the attacker's capabilities?","**Shell scripts** are computer programs designed to be run by a command-line interpreter, such as a Unix shell or PowerShell, to automate tasks. In this breach, with the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1, the attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely on Workstation A, allowing for automated or controlled malicious actions."
Describe the attacker's lateral movement activities between December 2017 and June 2018.,"After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally in the network between December 2017 and June 2018. This lateral movement involved compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. **Lateral movement** refers to techniques that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
What systems were compromised during the lateral movement phase from December 2017 to June 2018?,"During the lateral movement phase, which occurred between December 2017 and June 2018, the attacker compromised the Citrix servers located in SGH. These Citrix servers were specifically noted to be connected to the SCM database."
"What is ""lateral movement"" in the context of a cyberattack?","**Lateral movement** in the context of a cyberattack refers to the techniques that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. After gaining initial access to one system, attackers use lateral movement to access other systems and resources within the same network, often seeking higher privileges or more valuable data."
What evidence confirmed the attacker's lateral movements?,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers within the network. **Endpoints** are end-user devices such as workstations, laptops, and mobile devices, while **servers** are computers or programs that provide functionality for other programs or devices, called ""clients."""
Characterize the malware samples found during the analysis of lateral movements.,"The malware samples found and analysed by CSA during the lateral movement phase were characterized as either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants. These variants were not seen in-the-wild and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions, indicating their advanced nature."
Name the specific malware types identified during the lateral movement phase.,"The specific malware types identified during the lateral movement phase included RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to in this report as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
"What does it mean for malware to be ""stealthy by design""?","For malware to be ""stealthy by design"" means that it was intentionally created to avoid detection by security software and systems. This often involves techniques like obfuscation, anti-analysis features, or mimicking legitimate processes to remain hidden within a compromised environment."
How did the discovered malware evade detection by standard anti-malware solutions?,The discovered malware evaded detection by standard anti-malware solutions because it consisted of either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that had not been seen in-the-wild. This novelty and inherent stealth made them difficult for conventional anti-malware software to identify.
"What is an ""endpoint"" in the context of malware proliferation?","An **endpoint** in the context of malware proliferation refers to any end-user device connected to a network, such as workstations, laptops, and mobile devices. The proliferation of malware across these endpoints and servers was evidence of the attacker's lateral movements."
"What is a ""server"" in the context of malware proliferation?","A **server** in the context of malware proliferation refers to a computer or program that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called ""clients,"" over a network. The proliferation of malware across servers, in addition to endpoints, was a key indicator of the attacker's lateral movements within the network."
What methods did the attacker use to distribute malware and infect other machines?,"The attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware and infect other machines. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives. **PowerShell commands** are instructions executed by the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language, often used for system administration but can be exploited for malicious purposes."
What was CSA's assessment regarding the compromise of authentication systems?,CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system. This compromise led to the attacker obtaining administrator and user credentials. **Windows authentication system** refers to the security mechanisms within Microsoft Windows that verify the identity of users and services attempting to access resources.
What was the ultimate consequence of the attacker's actions in terms of control?,"The ultimate consequence of the attacker's actions was gaining full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and the underlying data within the domain. This indicates a complete compromise of the organization's IT infrastructure."
"Define ""PowerShell commands"" in the context of malware distribution.","**PowerShell commands** are instructions executed by the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language. While typically used for legitimate system administration, in this breach, they were exploited by the attacker to distribute malware and infect other machines, facilitating the spread of malicious software across the network."
"What are ""mapped network drives"" and how were they used by the attacker?","**Mapped network drives** are logical drive letters (like Z: or Y:) assigned to shared folders or resources on a network server, allowing users to access them as if they were local drives. The attacker used these mapped network drives to copy malicious files between machines, facilitating the distribution of malware across the network."
"What does ""compromising the Windows authentication system"" entail?","""Compromising the Windows authentication system"" entails an attacker gaining unauthorized access to and control over the security mechanisms within Microsoft Windows that verify the identity of users and services. This typically involves bypassing or exploiting weaknesses in the system to obtain legitimate credentials, such as administrator and user passwords, as was assessed in this breach."
What types of credentials did the attacker obtain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system, the attacker obtained both administrator and user credentials. These credentials would have granted them elevated access and control over various systems and resources within the domain."
What specific assets within the domain did the attacker gain full control over?,"The attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and the underlying data within the domain. This comprehensive control indicates a severe and widespread compromise of the organization's digital assets."
"What is the significance of obtaining ""administrator credentials""?","Obtaining **administrator credentials** is highly significant because it grants an attacker the highest level of access and control over a system or network. With administrator privileges, an attacker can install software, modify system settings, access sensitive data, create or delete users, and essentially take full control of the compromised resources, as was the case in this breach."
"How did the attacker leverage ""mapped network drives"" for malware distribution?","The attacker leveraged **mapped network drives** by copying malicious files between machines over these drives. Mapped network drives provide a convenient way for users to access shared network resources, but in this instance, they were exploited as a pathway to spread malware across multiple systems within the network."
"What is the overall timeline for the ""Privilege escalation and lateral movement"" phase?","The ""Privilege escalation and lateral movement"" phase occurred between December 2017 and June 2018. During this period, the attacker expanded their access from Workstation A to other parts of the network, compromising additional systems and obtaining higher privileges."
Summarize the key findings regarding the initial breach and control establishment over Workstation A.,"The initial breach and establishment of control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017. During this period, CSA discovered malicious artefacts including a log file with password dumping capability, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT 1). The hacking tool was installed by exploiting an unpatched Outlook vulnerability, and both the hacking tool and RAT 1 provided the attacker with capabilities such as remote shell script execution, file upload/download, and persistent presence. By December 1, 2017, the attacker had completed the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain."
