Analyse the initial evidence of breach discovered in Workstation A.,"The initial evidence of breach in Workstation A, discovered by CSA, included several malicious artefacts. These were a log file, which was identified as a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT 1). A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Describe the capabilities of RAT 1 as observed in Workstation A.,"RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with significant capabilities over Workstation A. Specifically, it enabled the attacker to access and control the workstation, perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and facilitate the uploading and downloading of files. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is malicious software that grants an attacker unauthorized remote control over a compromised computer."
What was the significance of the log file discovered in Workstation A?,"The log file discovered in Workstation A was significant because it was a remnant file from a known malware that possessed password dumping capability. This log file was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017 and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. **Plaintext** refers to unencrypted information, meaning the password credentials were stored in a readable format."
Explain how the publicly available hacking tool contributed to the attacker's persistent presence.,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence on Workstation A once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. **Persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period, even after initial vulnerabilities are patched or credentials are changed."
Detail the additional functionalities provided by the hacking tool beyond persistent presence.,"Beyond enabling persistent presence, the hacking tool also allowed the attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) by systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found. A **backdoor** is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device (such as a cryptographic module, a program, or a computer system)."
Analyse the method used to install the public hacking tool on Workstation A.,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 December 2017 by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system or software that can be exploited by an attacker. It was noted that a patch for this vulnerability was available at the time but had not been installed on Workstation A. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it."
Describe the nature of the malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A.,"The malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A by the hacking tool were masqueraded as .jpg image files. However, these files in fact contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts was identified as a modified PowerShell script taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool. A **PowerShell script** is a sequence of commands written in the PowerShell scripting language, used for automating tasks and managing systems."
