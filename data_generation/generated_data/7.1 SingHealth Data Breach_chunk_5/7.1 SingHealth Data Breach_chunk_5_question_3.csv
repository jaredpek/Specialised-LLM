What were the initial findings by CSA regarding malicious artifacts in Workstation A?,"The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) discovered several malicious artifacts in Workstation A. These included a log file, which was identified as a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan (RAT) referred to as ""RAT 1""."
What is the significance of the log file discovered in Workstation A?,"The log file discovered in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware. Its significance lies in its password dumping capability, meaning it could extract passwords from the system. This file was created on Workstation A on August 29, 2017, and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. The malware associated with this log file was likely used by the attacker for privilege escalation and lateral movement."
"Define ""RAT 1"" and describe its capabilities as observed in Workstation A.","""RAT 1"" refers to a customized Remote Access Trojan (RAT) discovered in Workstation A. A Remote Access Trojan is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system. In this incident, RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling them to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
How did the publicly available hacking tool contribute to the attacker's persistent presence?,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence on a system. This means that once an email account had been breached, the attacker could retain access even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This capability ensures continued access despite user security measures."
What additional functionalities did the hacking tool provide to the attacker?,"Beyond maintaining persistent presence, the hacking tool provided the attacker with several additional functionalities. It allowed them to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor. A backdoor is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain remote access to a computer, and in this context, it allowed the attacker to regain entry into the system even if the initial implants were removed."
When was the log file created on Workstation A and what did it contain?,"The log file was created on Workstation A on August 29, 2017. This file contained password credentials in plaintext, which means the passwords were stored or transmitted in an unencrypted and readable format. These credentials appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A."
What was the likely purpose of the malware associated with the log file?,"The malware associated with the log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access."
When and how was the public hacking tool installed on Workstation A?,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. Its installation was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker."
"Was a patch available for the vulnerability exploited to install the hacking tool, and was it applied?","Yes, a patch was available at the time for the vulnerability exploited to install the hacking tool. However, the patch was not installed on Workstation A, leaving the system susceptible to the exploit."
What was the immediate consequence of the hacking tool's successful installation?,The immediate consequence of the hacking tool's successful installation was its use to download malicious files onto Workstation A. These files were critical for the attacker's subsequent activities within the system.
How were the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool disguised?,"The malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool were disguised by being masqueraded as .jpg image files. This technique, known as masquerading, helps attackers evade detection by making malicious files appear innocuous. In reality, these files contained malicious PowerShell scripts."
"What is a PowerShell script, and what was notable about one of the scripts found?","A PowerShell script is a sequence of commands written in the PowerShell scripting language, used for task automation and configuration management on Windows systems. One of the malicious PowerShell scripts found on Workstation A was thought to be a modified script taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool. Post-exploitation tools are used by attackers after they have gained initial access to a system to further their objectives, such as gathering information, escalating privileges, or maintaining persistence."
"By December 2017, what new capabilities did the attacker gain with the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1?","By December 2017, with the introduction of both the hacking tool and RAT 1, the attacker gained enhanced capabilities. Specifically, they could execute shell scripts remotely on Workstation A, and also upload and download files to and from the workstation. Shell scripts are programs designed to be run by the Unix shell or other command-line interpreters, allowing for automated execution of commands."
"Which phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework did the attacker complete by December 1, 2017?","By December 1, 2017, the attacker was able to go through the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, from initial reconnaissance to the attacker's objective."
Describe the attacker's lateral movement activities between December 2017 and June 2018.,"After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally in the network between December 2017 and June 2018. This lateral movement involved compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. Lateral movement is the process of an attacker moving from one compromised system to other systems within the same network to expand their control and access."
What evidence indicated the attacker's lateral movements?,Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers within the network. This widespread distribution of malicious software indicated that the attacker was actively moving between different systems.
What were the characteristics of the malware samples found during the lateral movement phase?,"The malware samples found and analyzed by CSA during the lateral movement phase exhibited specific characteristics. They were either stealthy by design, meaning they were engineered to avoid detection, or they were unique variants not previously seen in-the-wild. Crucially, these malware samples were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions, highlighting their advanced nature."
Which specific malware types were identified during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase?,"During the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase, the specific malware types identified included RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file. RAT 2, like RAT 1, is a type of malware that grants an attacker remote control over a compromised system."
How did the attacker distribute malware to infect other machines?,"The attacker distributed malware to infect other machines primarily through the use of PowerShell commands and by copying malicious files between machines over mapped network drives. PowerShell commands are instructions executed via the PowerShell scripting language, and mapped network drives are network resources that appear as local drives on a computer, facilitating file transfer."
What was CSA's assessment regarding the attacker's compromise of authentication systems?,CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator and user credentials. The Windows authentication system is responsible for verifying the identity of users and services attempting to access resources on a Windows network. Obtaining these credentials would grant the attacker significant access privileges.
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker would have gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and the underlying data within the domain. This signifies a complete compromise of the network infrastructure."
"What is a ""malware set"" as mentioned in the context of the log file?","A ""malware set"" refers to a collection or suite of malicious software components designed to work together to achieve an attacker's objectives. In the context of the log file, it indicates that the log file was a remnant, or a leftover piece, from a broader collection of malware that had been deployed on Workstation A."
"What does ""password dumping capability"" mean in relation to the log file?","""Password dumping capability"" refers to the ability of a piece of malware or a tool to extract password hashes or plaintext passwords from a system's memory or storage. In the case of the log file, it was a remnant from malware known to possess this capability, meaning it could have been used to steal user credentials."
"What is a ""brute force attack"" in the context of email account passwords?","A ""brute force attack"" is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to guess information, such as passwords. In the context of email account passwords, it involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. The hacking tool allowed attackers to perform simple brute force attacks to gain access to email accounts."
"What are ""mail exchange servers"" and how did the hacking tool interact with them?","Mail exchange servers are dedicated computer systems responsible for handling and routing email messages within an organization's network and across the internet. The hacking tool allowed an attacker to interact remotely with these servers, which could involve activities such as sending, receiving, or intercepting emails, or exploiting vulnerabilities within the server itself."
"What does it mean for password credentials to be in ""plaintext""?","Password credentials in ""plaintext"" means that the passwords were stored or transmitted in an unencrypted, human-readable format. This makes them highly vulnerable to theft, as anyone gaining access to the file or communication channel can immediately read and use the passwords without needing to decrypt them."
"What is ""privilege escalation"" in cybersecurity?","""Privilege escalation"" in cybersecurity is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. This allows an attacker to gain higher levels of control over a system, such as moving from a standard user account to an administrator account."
"What is ""lateral movement"" in the context of a cyberattack?","""Lateral movement"" in the context of a cyberattack refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access to a single system. The goal is to expand their control and access to other systems, often seeking more valuable data or higher privileges, as seen with the attacker compromising Citrix servers after Workstation A."
"What is a ""vulnerability"" and how was it relevant to the hacking tool's installation?","A ""vulnerability"" is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the system's security. In this case, the public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability found in the version of ""Outlook"" installed on the workstation, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access and install the tool."
"What is a ""patch"" in software, and why was its absence critical for Workstation A?","A ""patch"" in software is a piece of code designed to update, fix, or improve a computer program or its supporting data. It is often used to fix security vulnerabilities. The absence of an available patch on Workstation A was critical because it left the system exposed to the known vulnerability in ""Outlook,"" which the attacker then exploited to install the public hacking tool."
"What are ""PowerShell scripts"" and how were they used maliciously?","PowerShell scripts are sequences of commands written in the PowerShell scripting language, primarily used for task automation and configuration management on Windows operating systems. In this incident, they were used maliciously as part of the downloaded files, masqueraded as .jpg images, to distribute malware and infect other machines, indicating their role in the attacker's post-exploitation activities."
"What is an ""open source post-exploitation tool""?","An ""open source post-exploitation tool"" is a software utility whose source code is publicly available, designed to be used by attackers after they have successfully gained initial access to a system. These tools help attackers further their objectives, such as escalating privileges, maintaining persistence, or gathering more information. One of the malicious PowerShell scripts found was thought to be a modified version from such a tool."
Briefly explain the 'Delivery' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The 'Delivery' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involves the transmission of the weaponized payload to the target. This can occur through various methods such as email attachments, malicious websites, USB drives, or, as implied in this incident, through the installation of a hacking tool and RAT 1 onto a workstation."
Briefly explain the 'Exploitation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The 'Exploitation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involves the attacker triggering the vulnerability on the target system to execute code. In this case, it refers to the attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the ""Outlook"" version on Workstation A to gain unauthorized access and install their tools."
Briefly explain the 'Installation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The 'Installation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involves the attacker installing persistent access mechanisms, such as backdoors or remote access tools, on the compromised system. This allows them to maintain access even if the initial exploit is detected or removed. The installation of RAT 1 and the hacking tool on Workstation A falls into this phase."
Briefly explain the 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involves the attacker establishing a communication channel with the compromised system to remotely control it and issue commands. This phase was achieved by December 1, 2017, allowing the attacker to execute shell scripts remotely and upload/download files to Workstation A via tools like RAT 1 and the hacking tool."
"What are ""Citrix servers"" and how were they involved in the lateral movement?","Citrix servers are specialized servers that provide virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and application virtualization services, allowing users to access applications and desktops remotely. In the lateral movement phase, the attacker compromised Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database, indicating their use as a pivot point to access further sensitive systems."
"What is the ""SCM database"" and its connection to the compromised Citrix servers?","The document does not explicitly define ""SCM database."" However, it states that the compromised Citrix servers located in SGH were connected to the SCM database. This implies that the SCM database is a critical data repository, and its connection to the compromised Citrix servers made it a target or a resource accessible through the lateral movement."
"What does it mean for malware to be ""stealthy by design""?","For malware to be ""stealthy by design"" means that it is intentionally developed with features and techniques to evade detection by security software and analysts. This includes methods like obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, and low-profile communication, making it difficult for standard anti-malware solutions to identify and neutralize it."
"What are ""unique variants"" of malware?","""Unique variants"" of malware refer to versions of malicious software that have been modified or customized in such a way that they differ significantly from known malware signatures. These unique characteristics make them difficult for traditional signature-based anti-malware solutions to detect, as they haven't been cataloged in threat intelligence databases."
"What is ""RAT 2"" and how does it relate to RAT 1?","""RAT 2"" is another Remote Access Trojan (RAT) identified during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase, similar to RAT 1. Both are types of malware that provide attackers with remote control over compromised systems. The document refers to RAT 2 as another RAT, implying it serves a similar function to RAT 1 in granting remote access and control capabilities to the attacker."
"What are ""mapped network drives"" and how were they used by the attacker?","Mapped network drives are network resources, such as shared folders on a server, that are assigned a drive letter on a local computer, making them appear and function like local storage. The attacker used mapped network drives to copy malicious files between machines, facilitating the distribution of malware and infection of other systems within the network."
"What is the ""Windows authentication system"" and why was its compromise significant?","The ""Windows authentication system"" is the mechanism within Windows operating systems responsible for verifying the identity of users and services attempting to access resources. Its compromise was significant because it allowed the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials, effectively granting them legitimate access to a wide range of systems and data within the domain, bypassing security controls."
"What are ""administrator and user credentials""?","""Administrator and user credentials"" refer to the usernames and passwords (or other authentication factors) required to log in and access systems with different levels of privilege. Administrator credentials grant full control over a system, while user credentials provide standard, limited access. Obtaining these allowed the attacker to impersonate legitimate users and administrators."
"What does ""full control over all Windows based servers and hosted applications"" imply for the attacker?","""Full control over all Windows based servers and hosted applications"" implies that the attacker had complete administrative access and authority over these critical components of the network infrastructure. This means they could execute any command, modify configurations, access all data, and potentially deploy further malicious tools without restriction on these systems."
"What does ""full control over all employee workstations"" mean for the attacker?","""Full control over all employee workstations"" means the attacker had complete administrative access to every computer used by employees within the domain. This allowed them to monitor user activity, steal data, install additional malware, and use these workstations as launchpads for further attacks or to access sensitive information stored locally."
"What does ""full control over underlying data, within the domain"" signify?","""Full control over underlying data, within the domain"" signifies that the attacker had unrestricted access to all information stored and processed across the entire network. This includes sensitive organizational data, personal employee information, and any other digital assets, allowing for exfiltration, modification, or destruction of data."
What was the timeframe for the initial evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A?,"The timeframe for the initial evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A spanned from August to December 2017. This period covers the discovery of malicious artifacts, the creation of the log file, and the installation of the hacking tool and RAT 1, leading to the attacker gaining remote control capabilities."
What was the timeframe for privilege escalation and lateral movement?,"The timeframe for privilege escalation and lateral movement activities by the attacker was from December 2017 to June 2018. This period followed the initial breach of Workstation A and involved the attacker expanding their access across the network, including compromising Citrix servers."
What was the role of the log file in the attacker's overall strategy?,"The log file, containing plaintext password credentials and originating from malware with password dumping capability, played a crucial role in the attacker's overall strategy. It was likely used to obtain passwords, which are essential for privilege escalation—gaining higher access rights—and lateral movement, enabling the attacker to spread across the network to other systems and expand their control."
