These Citrix servers were connected to the SCM database. Lateral movement refers to techniques that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. Citrix servers are a type of server that provides virtualized applications and desktops to users."
What evidence supported the attacker's lateral movements?,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. This included malware samples that were stealthy by design, unique variants not seen in-the-wild, and not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. Endpoints are computing devices that connect to a network, such as workstations, laptops, and mobile devices."
List the specific types of malware identified during the lateral movement phase.,"During the lateral movement phase, the specific types of malware identified included RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system."
What characteristics made the malware used for lateral movement difficult to detect?,"The malware used for lateral movement was difficult to detect because the samples found and analysed by CSA were either tools that were stealthy by design, unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild, and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. Stealthy by design means the malware was specifically crafted to avoid detection."
How did the attacker distribute malware to infect other machines during lateral movement?,"The attacker distributed malware to infect other machines during lateral movement through the use of PowerShell commands and by copying malicious files between machines over mapped network drives. PowerShell commands are instructions executed using the PowerShell scripting language, often used by attackers for system control and automation. Mapped network drives are local drive letters that point to shared folders on a network server."
What was the assessment by CSA regarding the attacker's compromise of authentication systems?,"CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator and user credentials. The Windows authentication system is responsible for verifying the identity of users and services attempting to access resources on a Windows network. Credentials are information, such as usernames and passwords, used to verify a user's identity."
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker would have gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. A domain in this context refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database and security policies."
Define 'privilege escalation' in the context of the attack.,"Privilege escalation in the context of this attack refers to the process by which the attacker obtained passwords from the log file and later compromised the Windows authentication system to gain elevated access. This allowed them to move from a lower level of access to a higher one, such as administrator privileges. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user."
Define 'lateral movement' in the context of the attack.,"Lateral movement in the context of this attack refers to the techniques used by the attacker to move from the initially compromised Workstation A to other parts of the network, such as the Citrix servers in SGH, and eventually gaining full control over servers, applications, and workstations within the domain. Lateral movement refers to techniques that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
"What is ""RAT 2"" and how was it involved in the lateral movement?","""RAT 2"" is another Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that was identified as part of the malware proliferation across endpoints and servers during the attacker's lateral movements.

Citrix servers are a type of server that provides virtualized applications and desktops to users."
"What is the significance of malware being ""stealthy by design"" in this context?","The significance of malware being ""stealthy by design"" in this context is that it was specifically created to avoid detection by security measures. This characteristic contributed to the malware not being detected by standard anti-malware solutions, allowing the attacker's lateral movements to go unnoticed for a period."
"What does it mean for malware to be ""unique variants not seen in-the-wild""?","For malware to be ""unique variants not seen in-the-wild"" means that the specific versions or forms of the malware samples found were novel and had not been previously observed or documented in active cyberattacks by the broader cybersecurity community. This uniqueness makes them harder for traditional signature-based anti-malware solutions to detect."
What was the ultimate goal of obtaining passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement?,"The ultimate goal of obtaining passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement was for the attacker to gain full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement refers to techniques that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
How did mapped network drives facilitate malware distribution?,Mapped network drives facilitated malware distribution by providing a mechanism for malicious files to be copied between machines. This allowed the attacker to spread malware across the network from one compromised system to another. Mapped network drives are local drive letters that point to shared folders on a network server.
What is the SCM database and its relevance to the attack?,"The SCM database is a database that the compromised Citrix servers in SGH were connected to. Its relevance to the attack is that by compromising the Citrix servers, the attacker gained access to systems that were directly linked to this database, indicating a potential target for data exfiltration or further system compromise."
"What are ""administrator and user credentials"" and why are they important to an attacker?","""Administrator and user credentials"" are the usernames and passwords or other authentication tokens used to verify the identity of administrators and regular users within a system. They are important to an attacker because obtaining them grants access to systems and data, with administrator credentials providing the highest level of control, enabling privilege escalation and full control over the domain."
"What is a ""domain"" in the context of the attacker's full control?","In the context of the attacker's full control, a ""domain"" refers to a logical group of networked computers that share a common central database of user accounts and security policies. Gaining full control over the domain means the attacker had control over all resources, users, and data managed within that network structure."
"What does ""proliferation of malware"" signify regarding lateral movement?","The ""proliferation of malware"" signifies that during the lateral movement phase, the attacker successfully spread various malicious software across numerous endpoints and servers within the network. This widespread distribution is a key indicator of an attacker's ability to move beyond the initial point of compromise and establish a broader presence."
What is the significance of the malware not being detected by standard anti-malware solutions?,"The significance of the malware not being detected by standard anti-malware solutions is that it highlights the advanced nature and sophistication of the attack. It indicates that the malware either used novel techniques to evade detection or was specifically designed to bypass common security defenses, allowing it to operate undetected for a period. Anti-malware solutions are software programs designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software."
How did the attacker leverage PowerShell commands for lateral movement?,The attacker leveraged PowerShell commands for lateral movement by using them to distribute malware to infect other machines. This indicates that PowerShell was used as a tool for executing malicious code and automating the spread of the attack across the network. PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language used for automating tasks.
What types of systems were ultimately under the attacker's full control?,"The types of systems ultimately under the attacker's full control included all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain."
What is the role of the CSA in assessing the breach?,"The CSA (Cyber Security Agency) played a role in assessing the breach by discovering malicious artifacts in Workstation A, analyzing malware samples, and assessing that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained credentials. CSA is typically a government agency responsible for cybersecurity."
What was the date the log file containing plaintext password credentials was created?,The log file containing plaintext password credentials was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017. Plaintext refers to data that is not encrypted and is readable without any special decoding.
"What is a ""vulnerability"" in the context of the Outlook installation?","In the context of the Outlook installation, a ""vulnerability"" refers to a weakness or flaw in the software that could be exploited by an attacker. The attacker exploited such a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" on Workstation A to install the public hacking tool."
"What does ""post-exploitation tool"" mean in relation to the PowerShell scripts?","A ""post-exploitation tool"" in relation to the PowerShell scripts means that the scripts were derived from a tool designed for use after an attacker has already gained initial access to a system. These tools help attackers further their objectives, such as maintaining access, escalating privileges, or moving laterally within the network."
Summarise the overall timeline of the breach from initial evidence to full control.,"The overall timeline of the breach began with the first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A from August to December 2017. This phase involved the discovery of malware like RAT 1 and a hacking tool, and the completion of initial Cyber Kill Chain phases.
