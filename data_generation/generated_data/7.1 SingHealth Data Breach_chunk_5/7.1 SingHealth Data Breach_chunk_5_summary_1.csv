Provide a comprehensive summary of the initial breach evidence discovered in Workstation A.,"The initial breach evidence discovered in Workstation A by CSA included a log file, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"". The log file was a remnant from a known malware set with password dumping capability and contained password credentials in plaintext, created on August 29, 2017. The publicly available hacking tool was installed on December 1, 2017, by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in Outlook. RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload and download files."
"Summarise the capabilities of ""RAT 1"" identified in Workstation A.","""RAT 1"", a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with several key capabilities. These included the ability to access and control Workstation A, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload and download files to and from the workstation. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system."
Can you summarise the key characteristics of the log file found in Workstation A?,"The log file found in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware set. It possessed password dumping capability, meaning it could extract passwords from the system. This log file was created on Workstation A on August 29, 2017, and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. **Plaintext** refers to unencrypted information, meaning the passwords were stored in a readable format."
Describe the functionality of the publicly available hacking tool used in the Workstation A breach.,"The publicly available hacking tool used in the Workstation A breach offered several functionalities to the attacker. It enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence on an email account even if the password was subsequently changed. Additionally, it allowed for remote interaction with mail exchange servers, performance of simple brute force attacks on user email account passwords, and served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if initial implants were removed. A **backdoor** is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device, or its embodiment."
Explain how the publicly available hacking tool was installed on Workstation A.,"The publicly available hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. This installation was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. A patch for this vulnerability was available at the time, but it had not been installed on Workstation A. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it."
What was the purpose of the malware discovered in Workstation A?,"The malware discovered in Workstation A was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords. The primary objectives for obtaining these passwords were privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network. **Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. **Lateral movement** refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
Summarise the types of malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A using the hacking tool.,"The hacking tool was used to download malicious files onto Workstation A. Some of these files were masqueraded as .jpg image files to appear innocuous. However, they actually contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts is believed to be a modified PowerShell script derived from an open-source post-exploitation tool. A **PowerShell script** is a sequence of commands written in the PowerShell scripting language, used for automating tasks and managing systems."
