What was the timeframe for the first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A?,The timeframe for the first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A was from August to December 2017.
List the malicious artefacts discovered by CSA in Workstation A.,"CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A, including:\n(i) A log file which was a remnant of a malware set.\n(ii) A publicly available hacking tool.\n(iii) A customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1""."
Describe the nature and capability of the log file found in Workstation A.,"The log file found in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware. This malware possessed password dumping capability, which is the ability to extract password credentials from a system."
Define RAT 1 and its capabilities as described in the document.,"RAT 1 is a customised Remote Access Trojan. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system. RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling them to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
How did the publicly available hacking tool contribute to maintaining a persistent presence for the attacker?,The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached. This persistence was maintained even if the password to the account was subsequently changed.
What are the additional capabilities provided by the hacking tool to an attacker?,"Beyond maintaining persistent presence, the hacking tool also allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. A backdoor is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device (e.g. a cryptosystem, an algorithm, a chipset, or a program)."
When was the log file created on Workstation A and what did it contain?,"The log file was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017. The file contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. Plaintext refers to unencrypted information or data, readable without any special decryption."
What was the likely purpose of the malware associated with the log file?,"The malware associated with the log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration vulnerability in an operating system or application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement refers to techniques that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
When was the public hacking tool installed on Workstation A and how was it installed?,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 December 2017. It was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker."
"Was a patch available for the vulnerability exploited to install the hacking tool, and was it applied?","Yes, a patch was available at that time for the vulnerability exploited to install the hacking tool. However, the patch was not installed on Workstation A then."
What was the immediate use of the successfully installed hacking tool?,The successfully installed hacking tool was used to download malicious files onto Workstation A.
Describe the nature of the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool.,"Some of the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool were masqueraded as .jpg image files. However, they in fact contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these PowerShell scripts is thought to be a modified script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language for task automation."
What capabilities did the attacker gain with the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017?,"With the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017, the attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as to upload and download files to Workstation A. Shell scripts are computer programs designed to be run by the Unix shell or other command-line interpreters."
Which phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework did the attacker complete by 1 December 2017?,"By 1 December 2017, the attacker was able to go through the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack."
Define the 'Delivery' phase within the context of the Cyber Kill Chain framework.,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Delivery' phase refers to the method by which the attacker transmits the exploit and payload to the target. An exploit is a piece of software, data, or sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something else (usually computer-controlled). A payload is the part of a malware that performs the malicious action."
Explain the 'Exploitation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain.,The 'Exploitation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain is the stage where the attacker leverages a vulnerability to gain access to a system. A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker.
What does the 'Installation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involve?,The 'Installation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain involves the attacker installing persistent access mechanisms on the compromised system. These mechanisms can include backdoors or Remote Access Trojans (RATs).
Describe the 'Command and Control' phase in the Cyber Kill Chain framework.,The 'Command and Control' (C2) phase in the Cyber Kill Chain framework is the stage where the attacker establishes a communication channel to control the compromised system and issue commands. This allows the attacker to maintain ongoing access and control over the compromised network.

"After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, how did the attacker move laterally in the network?","After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally in the network by compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH. These Citrix servers were connected to the SCM database. Citrix servers provide virtualized applications and desktops, allowing users to access them remotely."
What evidence indicated the attacker's lateral movements?,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. Endpoints are devices such as workstations, laptops, and mobile devices that connect to a network."
Characterize the malware samples found and analyzed by CSA during the lateral movement phase.,"Malware samples found and analyzed by CSA during the lateral movement phase were either tools that were stealthy by design, or unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. Stealthy by design means the malware was specifically created to avoid detection."
Which specific malware types were included in the samples found during the lateral movement phase?,"The malware samples found during the lateral movement phase included RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file."
What methods did the attacker use to distribute malware and infect other machines during lateral movement?,"The attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware and infect other machines. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives. Mapped network drives are connections to shared folders on a network computer that are assigned a drive letter on the local computer, making them appear as local drives."
What did CSA assess regarding the attacker's compromise of authentication systems?,CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator and user credentials. The Windows authentication system is the mechanism by which Windows verifies the identity of users and services attempting to access resources. Credentials refer to information (like usernames and passwords) used to authenticate and authorize access.
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining credentials?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, and all employee workstations and underlying data within the domain. A domain in this context refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that are managed as a unit with common rules and procedures."
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system. It typically provides capabilities such as accessing files, executing commands, and monitoring user activity from a remote location."
What is meant by 'password dumping capability'?,"'Password dumping capability' refers to the ability of a malware or tool to extract password credentials, often in plaintext or hashed form, from a system's memory or storage. This allows an attacker to obtain user passwords for unauthorized access."
Explain the term 'persistent presence' in the context of a cyberattack.,"'Persistent presence' in a cyberattack refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period, even after initial detection or attempts to remove them. This often involves installing backdoors or other mechanisms to regain entry."
What is a 'brute force attack' as mentioned in relation to email accounts?,"A 'brute force attack' is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords. It involves systematically checking all possible passwords or passphrases until the correct one is found. In this context, it was used to guess a user's email account password."
What is a 'hidden backdoor' and its purpose in this breach?,"A 'hidden backdoor' is a secret method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system. In this breach, the hacking tool served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants (malware) were removed, ensuring continued access."
What does 'plaintext' mean in the context of password credentials?,"In the context of password credentials, 'plaintext' means that the passwords were stored or transmitted in an unencrypted, human-readable format. This makes them easily accessible to anyone who gains access to the file or system containing them, without needing any special decryption."
What is a 'vulnerability' in cybersecurity?,"A 'vulnerability' in cybersecurity is a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the system's security. Exploiting a vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system control."
What is a 'patch' in the context of software security?,"A 'patch' in the context of software security is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities, which, if unpatched, can be exploited by attackers."
What are 'PowerShell scripts' and how were they used by the attacker?,"PowerShell scripts are computer programs or sequences of commands written in PowerShell, a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft for task automation. The attacker used malicious PowerShell scripts, some masqueraded as .jpg files, to distribute malware and infect other machines."
What is an 'open source post-exploitation tool'?,"An 'open source post-exploitation tool' refers to a publicly available software tool, with its source code accessible, designed to be used by attackers after they have already gained initial access to a system. These tools help in further compromising the system, escalating privileges, or moving laterally within a network."
What are 'shell scripts' and what capability did RAT 1 provide regarding them?,"Shell scripts are computer programs designed to be run by the Unix shell or other command-line interpreters. RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to execute these shell scripts remotely on the compromised workstation, allowing for remote command execution."
What are 'mail exchange servers' and how did the hacking tool interact with them?,"Mail exchange servers are dedicated computer systems responsible for handling and routing email messages within an organization's network and with external email systems. The hacking tool allowed an attacker to interact remotely with these mail exchange servers, potentially for reconnaissance or further compromise."
What are 'Citrix servers' and their role in the lateral movement phase?,"Citrix servers are servers that provide virtualized applications and desktops, allowing users to access them remotely from various devices. In the lateral movement phase, the attacker compromised Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database, indicating their importance in accessing critical data."
What is the significance of malware being 'stealthy by design'?,"Malware being 'stealthy by design' signifies that it was intentionally created to avoid detection by security software and systems. This characteristic makes it particularly difficult for standard anti-malware solutions to identify and neutralize the threat, as observed in the lateral movement phase of this breach."
What does it mean for malware to be 'not seen in-the-wild'?,For malware to be 'not seen in-the-wild' means that it is a new or unique variant that has not been previously observed or documented by cybersecurity researchers or security vendors in real-world attacks. This makes it harder for signature-based anti-malware solutions to detect it.
What is the 'Windows authentication system' and why was its compromise significant?,"The 'Windows authentication system' is the mechanism by which Windows verifies the identity of users and services attempting to access resources on a Windows-based network. Its compromise was significant because it allowed the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials, leading to full control over the domain's resources."
What are 'administrator and user credentials'?,"'Administrator and user credentials' refer to the authentication information, typically usernames and passwords, used to verify the identity of individuals or services accessing a system. Administrator credentials grant elevated privileges, allowing full control over system configurations and data, while user credentials provide standard access."
What is a 'domain' in the context of network control?,"In the context of network control, a 'domain' refers to a group of computers, devices, and users on a network that are managed as a single unit with common rules, policies, and procedures. Gaining full control over a domain means the attacker has administrative access to all resources within that managed group."
