Provide a comprehensive summary of the initial evidence of breach and control establishment over Workstation A.,"The initial evidence of breach and establishment of control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017. During this period, CSA discovered several malicious artefacts on Workstation A. These included a log file, which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"". The log file, created on August 29, 2017, contained plaintext password credentials belonging to the user of Workstation A and was associated with malware capable of password dumping. RAT 1 provided the attacker with the ability to access and control the workstation, allowing for remote execution of shell scripts and file transfers. The publicly available hacking tool, installed on December 1, 2017, by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in ""Outlook,"" enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence, interact with mail exchange servers, perform brute force attacks, and serve as a hidden backdoor. This tool was used to download malicious files, some masquerading as .jpg images but containing PowerShell scripts, onto Workstation A. By December 1, 2017, the attacker had successfully completed the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework."
Summarise the key malicious artefacts discovered in Workstation A during the initial breach.,"During the initial breach of Workstation A, CSA discovered three primary malicious artefacts: (i) a log file, (ii) a publicly available hacking tool, and (iii) a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT 1). The log file was a remnant of a malware set with password dumping capability. The publicly available hacking tool was used for maintaining persistent presence and other malicious activities. RAT 1, a Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with capabilities to access and control the workstation, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload/download files."
Can you summarise the capabilities of 'RAT 1' as identified in Workstation A?,"""RAT 1,"" a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with significant capabilities over Workstation A. Specifically, it enabled the attacker to access and control the workstation. This control allowed for performing functions such as executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
What was the significance of the log file found on Workstation A?,"The log file found on Workstation A was significant because it was a remnant file from a known malware that possessed password dumping capability. It was created on Workstation A on August 29, 2017, and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. This malware, associated with the log file, was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Password dumping refers to the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage."
Summarise the functionalities of the publicly available hacking tool used in the Workstation A breach.,"The publicly available hacking tool used in the Workstation A breach offered several critical functionalities to the attacker. It enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence even if the password to a breached email account was subsequently changed. Furthermore, the tool allowed the attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on user email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor to regain entry into the system if initial implants were removed. A persistent presence refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period, even after initial detection or remediation efforts. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs), typically by trying many combinations."
Describe how the publicly available hacking tool was installed on Workstation A.,"The publicly available hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. Its installation was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. Critically, a patch for this vulnerability was available at the time but had not been installed on Workstation A. This unpatched vulnerability allowed the attacker to successfully install the tool, which was then used to download malicious files onto the workstation. A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker."
What types of malicious files were downloaded onto Workstation A using the hacking tool?,"The hacking tool was used to download malicious files onto Workstation A. These files were masqueraded as .jpg image files to avoid detection. However, they actually contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these PowerShell scripts is believed to be a modified version taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool. PowerShell scripts are command-line shell and scripting language scripts used for automating tasks and configuration management in Windows environments."
Explain the attacker's capabilities after the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017.,"With the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017, the attacker significantly enhanced their capabilities. They gained the ability to execute shell scripts remotely on Workstation A, which allows for automated execution of commands and tasks. Additionally, the attacker could upload and download files to and from Workstation A, facilitating data exfiltration or the introduction of further malicious payloads. Shell scripts are computer programs designed to be run by the Unix shell or other command-line interpreters, used for automating system tasks."
"Which phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework did the attacker complete by December 1, 2017?","By December 1, 2017, the attacker had successfully progressed through several phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework. Specifically, they were able to go through the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, from reconnaissance to exfiltration."
Summarise the timeline and initial actions of privilege escalation and lateral movement.,"Privilege escalation and lateral movement occurred between December 2017 and June 2018. After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally within the network. This lateral movement involved compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. Privilege escalation refers to the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement describes the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
What evidence indicated the attacker's lateral movements across the network?,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers within the network. Additionally, the use of PowerShell commands by the attacker to distribute malware to infect other machines, and the copying of malicious files between machines over mapped network drives, further indicated lateral movement. Mapped network drives are local drive letters that are assigned to network shares, allowing users to access network resources as if they were local."
Describe the characteristics of the malware samples used for lateral movement.,"The malware samples found and analysed by CSA, which were used for lateral movement, exhibited specific characteristics. They were either tools that were stealthy by design, meaning they were engineered to avoid detection, or unique variants that had not been observed in-the-wild. Crucially, these malware samples were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions, highlighting their advanced nature and evasion capabilities. Stealthy by design refers to malware engineered to operate covertly, avoiding detection by security systems."
Identify the specific types of malware involved in the lateral movement phase.,"The specific types of malware involved in the lateral movement phase included ""RAT 1,"" which was also present in the initial breach, and another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2."" Additionally, the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file, which had password dumping capabilities, was also part of the lateral movement efforts. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
What was CSA's assessment regarding the compromise of the Windows authentication system?,"CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system. This compromise enabled the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials. The Windows authentication system is a security mechanism that verifies the identity of users and services attempting to access resources on a Windows network. Administrator and user credentials refer to the usernames and passwords or other authentication tokens used to verify the identity of administrators and regular users, respectively."
What extent of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over a significant portion of the network. This included all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and the underlying data within the domain. A domain, in this context, refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database and security policies, typically managed by a central server."
What was the specific vulnerability exploited to install the public hacking tool?,"The specific vulnerability exploited to install the public hacking tool on Workstation A was in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to gain unauthorized access and install the malicious tool. A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker."
Explain the role of Citrix servers in the attacker's lateral movement.,"The Citrix servers located in SGH played a crucial role in the attacker's lateral movement. After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker compromised these Citrix servers. These servers were significant because they were connected to the SCM database, providing a pathway for the attacker to potentially access sensitive information or further expand their control within the network. Citrix servers are used for virtual desktop infrastructure and application virtualization, allowing users to access applications and desktops remotely."
What is the significance of password credentials being stored in plaintext?,"The significance of password credentials being stored in plaintext is that it makes them immediately readable and usable by anyone who gains access to the file. In the context of the log file found on Workstation A, the presence of plaintext password credentials meant that the attacker did not need to perform any decryption or cracking to obtain the passwords, greatly simplifying their ability to gain unauthorized access and facilitate privilege escalation and lateral movement. Plaintext refers to data that is not encrypted and is readable in its original form."
What was the impact of the available patch not being installed on Workstation A?,"The impact of the available patch not being installed on Workstation A was critical. The public hacking tool was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" on the workstation. Had the patch been installed, this vulnerability would likely have been remediated, preventing the successful installation of the hacking tool. Consequently, the attacker would have been denied the capabilities provided by the tool, such as maintaining persistent presence, interacting with mail exchange servers, performing brute force attacks, and serving as a hidden backdoor, thereby hindering the breach's progression. A patch is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it."
Define 'persistent presence' in the context of the hacking tool's capabilities.,"In the context of the hacking tool's capabilities, 'persistent presence' refers to the attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system or account even after certain security measures are taken. Specifically, the document states that the hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This means the attacker could retain control or access despite password resets, indicating a deeper compromise or alternative access mechanism."
What does 'brute force attacks' mean in relation to the hacking tool's functions?,"In relation to the hacking tool's functions, 'brute force attacks' refers to a method used by the attacker to guess a user's email account password. This involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. The hacking tool allowed the attacker to perform these simple brute force attacks, aiming to gain unauthorized access to email accounts. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs), typically by trying many combinations."
Explain the concept of a 'hidden backdoor' as provided by the hacking tool.,"The concept of a 'hidden backdoor' provided by the hacking tool means that the tool could serve as an alternative, covert entry point for the attacker to regain access to the system. This was particularly important in the event that the initial implants, or other malicious components, were removed. A hidden backdoor ensures that even if some parts of the compromise are cleaned up, the attacker still has a way to re-enter the system without needing to exploit a new vulnerability or re-establish initial access. A backdoor is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device."
What is 'privilege escalation' in the context of the attacker's objectives?,"In the context of the attacker's objectives, 'privilege escalation' refers to the process of gaining higher-level access permissions than initially obtained. The document states that the malware associated with the log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation. This means the attacker aimed to move from a lower-privileged user account to a higher-privileged account, such as an administrator, to gain greater control over the system and network. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user."
Define 'lateral movement' as it pertains to the breach described.,'Lateral movement' as it pertains to the breach described refers to the techniques used by the attacker to move from an initially compromised system (Workstation A) to other systems within the network. This was done to expand their control and access to more valuable resources. The document mentions the attacker moved laterally to compromise Citrix servers and used PowerShell commands and file copying over mapped network drives as evidence of this movement. Lateral movement describes the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise.
What are 'malicious artefacts' in the context of the CSA's discovery?,"In the context of CSA's discovery, 'malicious artefacts' refer to any files, tools, or remnants left behind or used by an attacker that indicate a compromise or are designed to perform harmful actions. In Workstation A, these included a log file from a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT 1). These artefacts serve as forensic evidence of the breach and the attacker's activities. Malicious artefacts are digital traces or components of a cyberattack, such as malware files, log entries, or configuration changes, that indicate compromise or malicious activity."
What are 'shell scripts' and how were they used by the attacker?,"'Shell scripts' are computer programs designed to be run by a command-line interpreter, used for automating system tasks. In this breach, RAT 1 and the hacking tool provided the attacker with the capability to execute shell scripts remotely on Workstation A. This allowed the attacker to perform various automated functions, control the system, and potentially deploy further malicious commands without direct manual interaction on the workstation itself. Shell scripts are sequences of commands that are executed by a command-line interpreter, often used for automating tasks in operating systems."
What are 'mail exchange servers' and how did the hacking tool interact with them?,"'Mail exchange servers' are computer servers that handle the sending, receiving, and routing of email messages within an organization's network and with external email systems. The publicly available hacking tool allowed the attacker to interact remotely with these mail exchange servers. This capability could be used for various malicious purposes, such as intercepting emails, sending phishing messages, or gaining further access to user accounts or network resources. Mail exchange servers are dedicated servers responsible for managing and routing email traffic."
What are 'mapped network drives' and how were they leveraged by the attacker?,"'Mapped network drives' are local drive letters (e.g., Z:) that are assigned to network shares, allowing users to access network resources as if they were local folders on their own computer. The attacker leveraged mapped network drives as a mechanism for lateral movement. Evidence showed malicious files being copied between machines over these mapped network drives, indicating that the attacker used this common network functionality to distribute malware and expand their presence across the network. Mapped network drives provide convenient access to shared network resources by assigning them a local drive letter."
What is the 'Windows authentication system' and why was its compromise significant?,"The 'Windows authentication system' is a security mechanism within Windows operating systems that verifies the identity of users and services attempting to access resources. Its compromise was highly significant because CSA assessed that the attacker likely obtained administrator and user credentials by compromising this system. This meant the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain, effectively giving them pervasive access and control across the entire Windows environment. The Windows authentication system is responsible for verifying user identities and granting access to resources based on those identities."
What are 'administrator and user credentials' and what was the impact of their acquisition?,"'Administrator and user credentials' refer to the usernames and passwords or other authentication tokens used to verify the identity of administrators (users with elevated privileges) and regular users, respectively. The acquisition of these credentials by the attacker, likely through the compromise of the Windows authentication system, had a profound impact. It enabled the attacker to gain full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain, as these credentials provide the necessary authorization to access and manage those resources. Administrator credentials grant full control over a system, while user credentials provide standard access."
What does 'domain' refer to in the context of the attacker's full control?,"In the context of the attacker gaining full control, 'domain' refers to a logical group of networked computers and devices that share a common central database of user accounts and security policies, typically managed by a domain controller. By compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining credentials, the attacker gained full control over all systems and data within this defined network domain, indicating a widespread and deep compromise of the organization's IT infrastructure. A domain is a logical grouping of network resources that share a common directory database and security policies."

What types of systems did the attacker gain full control over after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain."
What was the method used by the attacker to distribute malware to other machines during lateral movement?,"During lateral movement, the attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware to infect other machines. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives. PowerShell commands are instructions executed via the PowerShell scripting language, often used for system administration and automation."
What characteristics made the malware used for lateral movement difficult to detect by standard anti-malware solutions?,"The malware used for lateral movement was difficult to detect by standard anti-malware solutions because it was either stealthy by design or comprised unique variants that had not been seen in-the-wild. This meant the malware was engineered to evade detection or was novel enough to bypass signature-based or heuristic detection methods of conventional anti-malware software. Stealthy by design refers to malware engineered to operate covertly, avoiding detection by security systems. In-the-wild refers to malware that has been observed actively circulating and infecting systems in real-world scenarios."
What was the primary purpose of the malware associated with the log file?,"The primary purpose of the malware associated with the log file was likely to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. The log file itself contained plaintext password credentials, indicating its role in facilitating unauthorized access and movement within the network."
How did the attacker initially gain a foothold in Workstation A?,"The attacker initially gained a foothold in Workstation A through the introduction of malicious artefacts, including a log file from a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT 1). The hacking tool was installed by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in Outlook, and RAT 1 provided direct access and control capabilities."
What was the significance of the malicious PowerShell scripts masquerading as .jpg image files?,"The significance of the malicious PowerShell scripts masquerading as .jpg image files was to evade detection. By disguising executable scripts as common, innocuous image files, the attacker aimed to bypass security controls that might block or flag executable content, making it easier to download and execute the malicious code on Workstation A. Masquerading is a technique where malicious files are disguised as legitimate or harmless files to avoid detection."
What is 'RAT 2' and how was it identified?,"""RAT 2"" is another Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that was identified during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase. It was found as part of the proliferation of malware across endpoints and servers, alongside RAT 1 and the malware associated with the log file. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
What specific database was connected to the compromised Citrix servers?,The compromised Citrix servers located in SGH were connected to the SCM database.
What does 'post-exploitation tool' mean in the context of the modified PowerShell script?,"In the context of the modified PowerShell script, a 'post-exploitation tool' refers to a type of software or framework used by an attacker after they have successfully gained initial access to a system. These tools are designed to facilitate further malicious activities, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence. The document states that one of the malicious PowerShell scripts was thought to be a modified script taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool, indicating its purpose was to advance the attack after the initial breach. Post-exploitation tools are used by attackers to extend their control and achieve their objectives after initial system compromise."
What was the primary method for the attacker to gain persistent presence on Workstation A?,"The primary method for the attacker to gain persistent presence on Workstation A was through the publicly available hacking tool. This tool enabled the attacker to maintain access even if the password to a breached email account was subsequently changed, and it could also serve as a hidden backdoor to regain entry if initial implants were removed."
What was the role of the 'Outlook' vulnerability in the breach?,"The 'Outlook' vulnerability played a critical role in the breach as it was exploited to install the publicly available hacking tool on Workstation A on December 1, 2017. The fact that a patch for this vulnerability was available but not installed allowed the attacker to successfully leverage this weakness to establish a stronger foothold and download further malicious files."
How did the attacker use PowerShell commands during the lateral movement phase?,"During the lateral movement phase, the attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware. These commands were instrumental in infecting other machines within the network, indicating a programmatic and automated approach to spreading the malicious payload beyond the initial point of compromise. PowerShell commands are instructions executed via the PowerShell scripting language, often used for system administration and automation."
What was the purpose of uploading and downloading files to Workstation A by the attacker?,"The purpose of uploading and downloading files to Workstation A by the attacker was to facilitate various malicious activities. Uploading files could involve introducing new malware, tools, or configurations to further the attack, while downloading files could involve exfiltrating sensitive data or collecting intelligence from the compromised workstation. This capability was provided by both RAT 1 and the hacking tool."
What does 'in-the-wild' mean regarding the malware variants used for lateral movement?,"Regarding the malware variants used for lateral movement, 'in-the-wild' means that these specific variants had not been observed actively circulating and infecting systems in real-world scenarios by security researchers or anti-malware vendors. This characteristic, along with their stealthy design, contributed to their ability to evade detection by standard anti-malware solutions. In-the-wild refers to malware that has been observed actively circulating and infecting systems in real-world scenarios."
What is the 'SCM database' and its relevance to the breach?,"The 'SCM database' is a database that was connected to the Citrix servers located in SGH. Its relevance to the breach is that after the attacker established an initial foothold in Workstation A, they moved laterally to compromise these Citrix servers, thereby gaining potential access to the SCM database. This suggests the database likely contained valuable or sensitive information that was a target for the attacker. The document does not explicitly define SCM, but its connection to compromised servers indicates its importance."
What was the role of the log file's password dumping capability?,"The log file's password dumping capability was crucial for the attacker to obtain password credentials. This capability, associated with the malware remnant, allowed the attacker to extract passwords, likely in plaintext, from Workstation A. This acquisition of credentials was a key step for subsequent privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network. Password dumping refers to the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage."
How did the attacker manage to bypass standard anti-malware solutions?,"The attacker managed to bypass standard anti-malware solutions because the malware samples used were either stealthy by design or unique variants that had not been seen in-the-wild. This meant the malware was specifically crafted to avoid detection mechanisms, such as signature-based scanning or heuristic analysis, commonly employed by standard anti-malware software."
What was the purpose of the attacker compromising Citrix servers in SGH?,"The purpose of the attacker compromising Citrix servers in SGH was to facilitate lateral movement within the network.
