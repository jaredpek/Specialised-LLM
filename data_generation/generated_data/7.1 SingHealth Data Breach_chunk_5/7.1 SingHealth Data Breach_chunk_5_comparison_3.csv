Compare the capabilities of RAT 1 with those of the publicly available hacking tool.,"RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. In contrast, the publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. It also allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. A 'persistent presence' refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period, even after initial vulnerabilities are patched or credentials changed. A 'hidden backdoor' is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain remote access to a computer or network. Both tools, when introduced in December 2017, collectively provided the attacker with the capability to execute shell scripts remotely and upload and download files to Workstation A."
What are the differences between the log file (malware remnant) and RAT 1 in terms of their nature and primary function?,"The log file was a remnant file from a known malware set which had password dumping capability. This suggests its primary function was related to extracting credentials. 'Password dumping' refers to the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. In contrast, RAT 1 was a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. While the log file was a residual artefact indicating a prior malware presence and its capability, RAT 1 was an active tool for direct remote control and operations."
Compare the password dumping capability of the malware associated with the log file with the remote control capabilities of RAT 1.,"The malware associated with the log file possessed password dumping capability, meaning it could extract user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The log file itself contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. This malware was likely used for privilege escalation and lateral movement. In contrast, RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. Thus, one focused on credential theft for escalation, while the other focused on direct operational control."
"What is the difference between maintaining a persistent presence and serving as a hidden backdoor, as enabled by the hacking tool?","Both capabilities were provided by the publicly available hacking tool. Maintaining a persistent presence refers to the ability of an attacker to retain access to a compromised email account even if the password to that account is subsequently changed. This ensures long-term access despite credential updates. Serving as a hidden backdoor, on the other hand, refers to the tool's ability to allow the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants are removed. A 'hidden backdoor' is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain remote access to a computer or network. While persistent presence focuses on continuous access to a specific account, a hidden backdoor provides a fallback mechanism for system re-entry."
Compare brute force attacks on email account passwords with password dumping capability.,"Brute force attacks on email account passwords, a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, involve systematically trying many possible passwords until the correct one is found. This is a method of guessing credentials. In contrast, password dumping capability, associated with the malware remnant log file, refers to the ability to extract existing user account passwords directly from a system's memory or storage. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The log file itself contained password credentials in plaintext. Thus, brute force is an active guessing method, while password dumping is an extraction method from an already compromised system or stored data."
What are the differences between interacting remotely with mail exchange servers and executing shell scripts remotely?,"Interacting remotely with mail exchange servers was a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, allowing the attacker to control or access email infrastructure from a distance. 'Mail exchange servers' are dedicated computers or systems responsible for sending, receiving, and storing email messages. Executing shell scripts remotely, a capability provided by RAT 1 and the hacking tool combined, refers to the attacker's ability to run command-line scripts on the compromised workstation from a remote location. 'Shell scripts' are programs designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell or Windows command prompt, automating tasks. While both involve remote actions, interacting with mail exchange servers is specific to email infrastructure, whereas executing shell scripts remotely provides broader command and control over the workstation's operating system."
Compare the initial capabilities of the publicly available hacking tool with the initial capabilities of RAT 1.,"The publicly available hacking tool initially enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. It also allowed remote interaction with mail exchange servers, performance of simple brute force attacks on email account passwords, and serving as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry. A 'persistent presence' refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. A 'hidden backdoor' is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication. In contrast, RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, initially provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. While the hacking tool focused on email account persistence and system re-entry, RAT 1 focused on direct workstation control and file operations."
What are the differences in the timing of the log file creation and the hacking tool installation?,"The log file was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017. This file contained password credentials in plaintext. In contrast, the public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 December 2017. This indicates that the log file, and the malware associated with it, predated the installation of the public hacking tool by several months, suggesting different phases or initial entry points of the breach."
Compare the method of obtaining plaintext password credentials with the general concept of password dumping capability.,"Plaintext password credentials refer to passwords stored or found in an unencrypted, readable format, as was the case with the log file created on Workstation A. This is the state of the credentials. Password dumping capability, on the other hand, refers to the functionality of a malware to extract user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. While plaintext credentials describe the format in which passwords are found, password dumping capability describes the action or tool used to acquire those passwords, potentially leading to them being stored in plaintext."
What are the differences between a vulnerability exploitation and a patch not being installed in the context of the hacking tool installation?,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" installed on the workstation. A 'vulnerability' is a weakness or flaw in a system's security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that can be exploited by a threat source. This exploitation was the direct action that allowed the tool's installation. The fact that a patch was available at that time but was not installed on Workstation A then refers to the absence of a security update that would have fixed the vulnerability. A 'patch' is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. The uninstalled patch was the underlying condition that allowed the vulnerability to be successfully exploited, making it a critical factor in the compromise."
Compare malicious files masqueraded as .jpg image files with the actual malicious PowerShell scripts they contained.,"Some of the malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A by the hacking tool were masqueraded as .jpg image files. 'Masquerading' means they were disguised to appear as legitimate image files to deceive users or security systems. However, these files in fact contained malicious PowerShell scripts. 'PowerShell scripts' are sequences of commands executed by the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language, often used for system administration but can be exploited for malicious purposes. One of these scripts was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. The difference lies in their appearance versus their true nature: the .jpg image file was a deceptive wrapper, while the PowerShell script was the actual executable malicious content."
What are the differences between an open source post-exploitation tool and a customised Remote Access Trojan like RAT 1?,"An open source post-exploitation tool, from which a modified PowerShell script was taken, refers to publicly available software designed to be used after an initial compromise to further penetrate a system or network. 'Open source' means its source code is publicly accessible. In contrast, RAT 1 was a customised Remote Access Trojan. A 'customised' tool implies it was specifically modified or developed for the attacker's particular objectives, rather than being used directly off-the-shelf. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. While both are used in post-exploitation, one is generic and publicly available, while the other is tailored and specific to the attacker's needs."
Compare the downloading of malicious files by the hacking tool with the uploading and downloading of files capability of RAT 1.,"The hacking tool was used to download malicious files onto Workstation A after its installation. This refers to the initial transfer of attacker-controlled malware onto the compromised system. In contrast, RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to both upload and download files to and from the workstation. This indicates a more general and bidirectional file transfer capability, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data (upload from workstation) or deploy additional tools (download to workstation) as needed during the command and control phase. Thus, the hacking tool's download was for initial infection, while RAT 1's upload/download was for ongoing data exfiltration and tool deployment."
What are the differences between the 'Delivery' phase and the 'Exploitation' phase in the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Delivery' phase refers to the transmission of the weaponized payload to the target. This is how the attacker gets the malicious code to the victim. The 'Exploitation' phase, which follows Delivery, involves the attacker triggering the weaponized payload to execute code on the target system, typically by exploiting a vulnerability. For instance, the public hacking tool was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in Outlook. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases, among others."
Compare the 'Installation' phase with the 'Command and Control' phase in the Cyber Kill Chain framework.,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Installation' phase involves the attacker installing persistent access mechanisms on the target system, such as backdoors or Remote Access Trojans, to maintain access. For example, the hacking tool and RAT 1 were installed. The 'Command and Control' phase, which follows Installation, involves the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised system and issue commands. This allows the attacker to operate within the network. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases, among others, indicating established remote control over Workstation A."
What are the differences between establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A and moving laterally in the network?,"Establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A refers to the first successful compromise of a system within the target network, gaining initial access. This occurred between August and December 2017. Moving laterally in the network, on the other hand, describes the attacker's actions after gaining an initial foothold, where they expand their access to other systems and segments within the network. This lateral movement occurred between December 2017 and June 2018, involving the compromise of Citrix servers located in SGH. 'Lateral movement' is a technique that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. Thus, the initial foothold is the entry point, while lateral movement is the expansion of control within the network."
Compare the compromise of Workstation A with the compromise of Citrix servers in SGH.,"Workstation A was the initial point of breach, where malicious artefacts like a log file, a publicly available hacking tool, and RAT 1 were discovered, and control was established between August and December 2017. This was the initial foothold. The Citrix servers located in SGH were compromised later, between December 2017 and June 2018, as part of the attacker's lateral movement within the network. These Citrix servers were connected to the SCM database. 'Citrix servers' are servers that host virtual applications and desktops, allowing users to access them remotely. Thus, Workstation A was the initial entry point, while the Citrix servers were subsequent targets for expanding control and accessing critical data during the lateral movement phase."
What are the differences between RAT 1 and RAT 2?,"RAT 1 was a customised Remote Access Trojan discovered as an initial malicious artefact in Workstation A, providing capabilities like workstation access and control, remote shell script execution, and file upload/download. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. RAT 2 was another Remote Access Trojan referred to in the report, found as part of the malware proliferation during the attacker's lateral movements between December 2017 and June 2018. While both are types of Remote Access Trojans, RAT 1 was identified as part of the initial breach, and RAT 2 was identified later during the expansion of the attack, suggesting they might be distinct variants or tools used at different stages or for different purposes in the lateral movement phase."
Compare malware that is detected by standard anti-malware solutions with malware that is not detected.,"Malware samples found during the lateral movements were either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild and not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This means such malware possessed characteristics that allowed it to evade detection by conventional security software. 'Anti-malware solutions' are software programs designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software. In contrast, malware that is detected by standard anti-malware solutions would be identifiable by these programs, likely due to known signatures or behavioral patterns. The fact that the attacker's malware was not detected highlights its advanced evasion capabilities."
What are the differences between stealthy by design malware and unique variants of malware?,"Both stealthy by design malware and unique variants were characteristics of the malware samples found during the lateral movements that were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. 'Stealthy by design' malware is specifically engineered with features to avoid detection, such as rootkit capabilities, obfuscation, or anti-analysis techniques. 'Unique variants' refer to modified versions of existing malware or entirely new malware strains that have not been previously observed in the wild, making them unknown to security databases and thus harder for signature-based detection to identify. While both aim for evasion, stealthy by design focuses on inherent evasion mechanisms, and unique variants refer to novelty in their form or code."
Compare the use of PowerShell commands to distribute malware with the remote execution of shell scripts.,"PowerShell commands were used by the attacker to distribute malware to infect other machines during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase. This indicates using PowerShell as a mechanism for spreading malicious code across the network. 'PowerShell commands' are instructions executed within the Windows PowerShell environment. In contrast, the remote execution of shell scripts was a capability provided by RAT 1 and the hacking tool, enabling the attacker to run command-line scripts on the compromised workstation from a remote location. 'Shell scripts' are programs designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell or Windows command prompt. While both involve remote scripting, PowerShell commands for distribution focus on spreading malware, whereas remote shell script execution focuses on direct command and control over a specific system."
What are the differences between copying malicious files over mapped network drives and uploading/downloading files to Workstation A?,"Copying malicious files between machines over mapped network drives was a method used by the attacker during privilege escalation and lateral movement to infect other machines. 'Mapped network drives' are local drive letters that are assigned to network shares, allowing users to access network resources as if they were local. This method leverages existing network shares for internal distribution. Uploading and downloading files to Workstation A was a capability provided by RAT 1 and the hacking tool, allowing the attacker to transfer files directly to or from the compromised workstation. While both involve file transfer, copying over mapped network drives is a lateral movement technique leveraging network shares, whereas uploading/downloading is a direct command and control function for a specific compromised host."
Compare compromising the Windows authentication system with performing brute force attacks on email account passwords.,"Compromising the Windows authentication system involved the attacker obtaining administrator and user credentials, likely through methods like credential dumping or exploiting weaknesses in the authentication process. 'Windows authentication system' refers to the mechanisms Windows uses to verify user identities and grant access to resources. This provides broad access to the domain. Performing simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password was a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, focusing specifically on guessing email account credentials. 'Brute force attacks' involve systematically trying many possible passwords until the correct one is found. Thus, compromising the Windows authentication system aims for broader system and domain access, while brute force attacks on email passwords target specific email accounts."
What are the differences between administrator credentials and user credentials?,"Administrator credentials refer to the usernames and passwords associated with accounts that have elevated privileges, granting full control over a system or domain. The attacker obtained these by compromising the Windows authentication system. 'Administrator credentials' provide the highest level of access and control. User credentials, on the other hand, refer to the usernames and passwords associated with standard user accounts, which have limited privileges compared to administrator accounts. The attacker also obtained these. The key difference lies in the level of access and control they grant: administrator credentials allow for system-wide changes and access to sensitive resources, while user credentials typically restrict actions to a user's own files and applications."
Compare privilege escalation with lateral movement.,"Privilege escalation refers to the process by which an attacker gains higher-level access than they initially had on a system. For example, obtaining passwords for privilege escalation was a purpose of the malware associated with the log file, and compromising the Windows authentication system to obtain administrator credentials is a form of privilege escalation. 'Privilege escalation' is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement, on the other hand, describes the attacker's actions to expand their access to other systems and segments within the network after gaining an initial foothold. 'Lateral movement' is a technique that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. While privilege escalation focuses on increasing access on a single system, lateral movement focuses on spreading access across multiple systems in a network."
What are the differences between full control over Windows-based servers and full control over employee workstations?,"Full control over Windows-based servers means the attacker gained complete administrative access to the servers running Windows operating systems and their hosted applications. 'Windows-based servers' are computers designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers over a network, running a Windows Server operating system. This typically implies control over critical infrastructure and services. Full control over employee workstations means the attacker gained complete administrative access to the individual computers used by employees. 'Employee workstations' are the desktop or laptop computers used by personnel for their daily tasks. While both represent significant compromise, control over servers often grants access to more critical data, applications, and network resources, whereas control over workstations provides access to individual user data and can be used as a pivot point for further lateral movement."
Compare full control over hosted applications with full control over underlying data within the domain.,"Full control over hosted applications means the attacker gained complete administrative access to the software applications running on the compromised servers and workstations. This allows manipulation of the application's functionality, data, and potentially its users. 'Hosted applications' are software programs that run on a server and are accessed by users over a network. Full control over underlying data within the domain means the attacker gained complete access to all data stored across the compromised network, including sensitive information. 'Underlying data' refers to the raw information stored and processed by the systems. While control over applications allows manipulation of services, control over underlying data provides direct access to the information itself, which is often the ultimate target of a breach."
What are the differences between malware distribution via PowerShell commands and malware downloaded via the hacking tool?,"Malware distribution via PowerShell commands was a method used by the attacker to infect other machines during lateral movement. This implies using PowerShell scripts to push or pull malware across the network. 'PowerShell commands' are instructions executed within the Windows PowerShell environment. Malware downloaded via the hacking tool refers to the initial transfer of malicious files onto Workstation A by the publicly available hacking tool, which exploited an Outlook vulnerability. This was an initial infection vector. Thus, the hacking tool was used for initial delivery to a single workstation, while PowerShell commands were used for broader internal distribution of malware across the network after initial access was established."
Compare obtaining passwords for privilege escalation (log file malware) with obtaining administrator and user credentials (Windows authentication system).,"Obtaining passwords for privilege escalation was the purpose of the malware associated with the log file, which had password dumping capability and contained plaintext credentials. This was an early method to gain higher access. 'Privilege escalation' is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources. Obtaining administrator and user credentials by compromising the Windows authentication system was a later assessment by CSA, indicating a broader compromise of the domain's identity management. 'Windows authentication system' refers to the mechanisms Windows uses to verify user identities. While both aim to acquire credentials for elevated access, the log file malware was an initial, specific instance of password theft, whereas compromising the Windows authentication system represents a more comprehensive and systemic acquisition of credentials across the domain."
What are the differences between the general concept of malware for lateral movement and the specific technique of PowerShell commands for lateral movement?,"Malware for lateral movement is a general term encompassing any malicious software used by an attacker to expand their access to other systems within a network after an initial compromise. This includes tools like RAT 1, RAT 2, and the malware associated with the log file. 'Lateral movement' is a technique that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. PowerShell commands for lateral movement is a specific technique where the attacker uses PowerShell scripts or commands to distribute malware or perform other actions to move between machines. 'PowerShell commands' are instructions executed within the Windows PowerShell environment. Thus, the former is a broad category of tools, while the latter is a particular method or technique used to achieve lateral movement."
Compare the initial compromise of Workstation A with the attacker gaining full control over the entire domain.,"The initial compromise of Workstation A involved the discovery of malicious artefacts like a log file, a publicly available hacking tool, and RAT 1, and establishing control over it between August and December 2017. This was the first point of entry and control. Gaining full control over the entire domain, which includes all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data, was a later stage achieved after privilege escalation and lateral movement, between December 2017 and June 2018. 'Domain' in this context refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database. The initial compromise was a single point of entry, while full domain control represents a comprehensive takeover of the network's resources and data."
What are the differences between a log file as a malicious artefact and PowerShell scripts as malicious artefacts?,"A log file, in this context, was a remnant file from a known malware set, discovered in Workstation A. It contained password credentials in plaintext and had password dumping capability. It was an artefact left behind by malware. 'Log file' is a file that records events that occur in an operating system or other software. PowerShell scripts, on the other hand, were malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool, masqueraded as .jpg image files. One of these was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. 'PowerShell scripts' are sequences of commands executed by the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language. While both are malicious artefacts, the log file was a passive remnant containing stolen data, whereas the PowerShell scripts were active executable code used for post-exploitation activities."
Compare a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT 1) with a publicly available hacking tool in terms of their origin or nature.,"RAT 1 was described as a customised Remote Access Trojan. 'Customised' implies it was specifically modified or developed for the attacker's particular objectives, making it potentially harder to detect with generic signatures. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. In contrast, the hacking tool was described as a publicly available hacking tool. 'Publicly available' means it is accessible to a wider audience, potentially off-the-shelf, and might be more commonly known or have existing detection mechanisms, though this specific one was not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. The key difference lies in their origin: one is tailored, the other is generic and widely accessible."
What are the differences between password dumping capability and the presence of plaintext password credentials?,"Password dumping capability refers to the functionality of a malware to extract user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. This is an active ability or feature of a malicious program. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The presence of plaintext password credentials refers to the state where passwords are found unencrypted and readable, as was the case in the log file created on Workstation A. This is the result or outcome of a process, possibly password dumping, or simply poor security practice. Thus, one is the action or capability, and the other is the observable state of the credentials."
Compare maintaining a persistent presence with regaining entry via a hidden backdoor.,"Both capabilities were provided by the publicly available hacking tool. Maintaining a persistent presence refers to the ability of an attacker to retain access to a compromised email account even if the password to that account is subsequently changed. This ensures continuous access to a specific account. 'Persistent presence' refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. Regaining entry via a hidden backdoor refers to the tool's ability to allow the attacker to re-enter the system if the initial implants are removed. A 'hidden backdoor' is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain remote access to a computer or network. While persistent presence focuses on maintaining access to an account, the backdoor focuses on re-establishing system access if primary tools are removed."
What are the differences between interacting remotely with mail exchange servers and uploading and downloading files?,"Interacting remotely with mail exchange servers was a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, allowing the attacker to control or access email infrastructure from a distance. 'Mail exchange servers' are dedicated computers or systems responsible for sending, receiving, and storing email messages. This is a specific type of remote interaction focused on email. Uploading and downloading files was a capability provided by RAT 1 and the hacking tool, allowing the attacker to transfer any type of file to or from the compromised workstation. This is a general file transfer capability. While both are remote actions, one is specific to email server management, and the other is a broader function for data exfiltration or tool deployment."
Compare the vulnerability in the version of 'Outlook' with the uninstalled patch.,"The vulnerability in the version of 'Outlook' installed on Workstation A was the specific security flaw that the public hacking tool exploited to gain entry and install itself. A 'vulnerability' is a weakness or flaw in a system's security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that can be exploited by a threat source. The uninstalled patch refers to the available software update that would have fixed this specific vulnerability. A 'patch' is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. The vulnerability was the exploitable weakness, and the uninstalled patch was the missed opportunity to remediate that weakness, allowing the exploitation to succeed."
What are the differences between malware masqueraded as .jpg image files and the actual malicious PowerShell scripts they contained?,"Malware masqueraded as .jpg image files refers to the deceptive outer appearance of some malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool. They were disguised to look like harmless image files to evade detection or trick users. 'Masquerading' means they were disguised to appear as legitimate image files. The actual malicious PowerShell scripts were the true content and executable payload hidden within these disguised files. 'PowerShell scripts' are sequences of commands executed by the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language, often used for system administration but can be exploited for malicious purposes. The .jpg image file was the camouflage, while the PowerShell script was the active threat."
Compare the 'Delivery' phase with the 'Installation' phase in the Cyber Kill Chain framework.,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Delivery' phase refers to the transmission of the weaponized payload to the target. This is the stage where the attacker gets the malicious code to the victim's system. The 'Installation' phase, which typically follows Delivery and Exploitation, involves the attacker installing persistent access mechanisms on the target system, such as backdoors or Remote Access Trojans, to maintain access. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases, among others. Delivery is about getting the malware to the target, while Installation is about establishing a lasting presence on the target."
What are the differences between the 'Exploitation' phase and the 'Command and Control' phase in the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Exploitation' phase involves the attacker triggering the weaponized payload to execute code on the target system, typically by exploiting a vulnerability. For example, the public hacking tool was installed by exploiting an Outlook vulnerability. The 'Command and Control' phase, which follows Installation, involves the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised system and issue commands. This allows the attacker to operate within the network. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases, among others. Exploitation is about gaining initial code execution, while Command and Control is about maintaining and leveraging that access for ongoing operations."
Compare compromising Citrix servers with compromising the Windows authentication system.,"Compromising Citrix servers located in SGH was part of the attacker's lateral movement between December 2017 and June 2018. These servers were connected to the SCM database, indicating a target for accessing specific applications or data. 'Citrix servers' are servers that host virtual applications and desktops. Compromising the Windows authentication system involved obtaining administrator and user credentials, which meant the attacker likely gained full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. 'Windows authentication system' refers to the mechanisms Windows uses to verify user identities. While compromising Citrix servers targets specific application infrastructure, compromising the Windows authentication system provides broader, foundational control over user identities and access across the entire domain."
What are the differences between the malware set (of which the log file was a remnant) and the open source post-exploitation tool (source of PowerShell script)?,"The malware set, of which the log file was a remnant, was a known malware that had password dumping capability. This was an early discovery, indicating a specific type of credential-stealing malware. An 'open source post-exploitation tool' is a publicly available software designed to be used after an initial compromise to further penetrate a system or network. A modified PowerShell script taken from such a tool was found among the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool. While both are sources of malicious code, the malware set refers to a specific, known family of malware with a particular capability (password dumping), whereas the open source post-exploitation tool is a broader category of publicly available tools used for various post-compromise activities, from which specific scripts can be adapted."
Compare the purpose of the malware associated with the log file with the purpose of the publicly available hacking tool.,"The malware associated with the log file, which had password dumping capability and contained plaintext credentials, was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. Its primary purpose was credential theft to elevate access and move within the network. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The publicly available hacking tool, on the other hand, served multiple purposes including maintaining a persistent presence, interacting remotely with mail exchange servers, performing brute force attacks on email passwords, and serving as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry. Its purpose was broader, encompassing persistent access, remote interaction, and re-entry mechanisms."
What are the differences between the initial malicious artefacts discovered in Workstation A and the malware samples found during lateral movements?,"The initial malicious artefacts discovered in Workstation A included a log file (remnant of a malware set with password dumping capability), a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"". These were found between August and December 2017, representing the initial breach. The malware samples found during lateral movements, between December 2017 and June 2018, proliferated across a number of endpoints and servers. These included RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file. These samples were characterized as stealthy by design or unique variants not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. The key difference is the stage of the attack: initial artefacts were for gaining the first foothold, while lateral movement malware was for expanding control and access across the network."
Compare the capability to execute shell scripts remotely with the capability to upload and download files.,"Both capabilities were provided to the attacker by RAT 1 and the hacking tool combined. Executing shell scripts remotely refers to the attacker's ability to run command-line scripts on the compromised workstation from a remote location. 'Shell scripts' are programs designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell or Windows command prompt, automating tasks. This grants direct operational control over the system. Uploading and downloading files refers to the attacker's ability to transfer files to or from the workstation. This allows for exfiltration of data or deployment of additional tools. While both are critical for remote control, executing scripts focuses on command execution, and file transfer focuses on data and tool movement."
What are the differences between a 'remnant of a malware set' and a 'known malware' with password dumping capability?,"A 'remnant of a malware set' refers to a residual file or trace left behind by a group of malicious software, as was the case with the log file found in Workstation A. This indicates that a malware infection had occurred and left behind evidence. A 'known malware' with password dumping capability refers to a specific type of malicious software that has the function to extract user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The log file was a remnant from such a known malware. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The difference is that 'remnant' describes the state of the evidence left behind, while 'known malware' describes the specific type of malicious program that caused it and its capabilities."
Compare the exploitation of a vulnerability in 'Outlook' with the general concept of a publicly available hacking tool.,"The exploitation of a vulnerability in the version of 'Outlook' installed on Workstation A was the specific method used by the attacker to gain initial access and install the public hacking tool. A 'vulnerability' is a weakness or flaw in a system's security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that can be exploited by a threat source. 'Outlook' is a widely used email client. The publicly available hacking tool is the actual software used by the attacker, which leveraged this specific vulnerability. It's a broader category of malicious software. The exploitation is the action or technique, while the hacking tool is the instrument used to perform that action."
What are the differences between the Cyber Kill Chain 'Delivery' phase and the 'Command and Control' phase?,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Delivery' phase refers to the transmission of the weaponized payload to the target. This is the initial stage where the malicious code reaches the victim. The 'Command and Control' phase, which occurs much later after exploitation and installation, involves the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised system and issue commands. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases. Delivery is about getting the malware to the target, while Command and Control is about actively managing and operating the compromised system remotely."
Compare the initial foothold in Workstation A with the compromise of the SCM database.,"The initial foothold in Workstation A was the first successful compromise of a system within the target network, established between August and December 2017, where malicious artefacts were discovered. This was the entry point. The SCM database was not directly compromised from Workstation A, but rather the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database, were compromised as part of lateral movement between December 2017 and June 2018. 'SCM database' likely refers to a database containing sensitive information, possibly related to patient or system configuration management. Thus, Workstation A was the initial entry, while the SCM database was a high-value target accessed indirectly through lateral movement via other compromised systems."
What are the differences between malware that is 'stealthy by design' and malware that is a 'unique variant'?,"Both 'stealthy by design' and 'unique variants' describe characteristics of the malware samples found during lateral movements that were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. 'Stealthy by design' means the malware was intentionally engineered with features to avoid detection, such as obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, or rootkit capabilities. 'Unique variants' refer to malware that is a new or significantly modified version of existing malware, or entirely new malware that has not been previously observed in the wild. This novelty makes it difficult for signature-based detection to identify. The distinction is that 'stealthy by design' refers to inherent evasion mechanisms, while 'unique variant' refers to the novelty or unfamiliarity of the malware's code or form."
Compare the role of RAT 1 in the initial breach with its role in lateral movement.,"RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, was discovered as an initial malicious artefact in Workstation A, providing the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload/download files. This was part of establishing the initial foothold. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. RAT 1 was also found among the malware samples proliferating across endpoints and servers during the attacker's lateral movements between December 2017 and June 2018. This indicates that RAT 1 was not only used for the initial compromise but was also a persistent tool leveraged to expand access and control across the network during the later stages of the attack."
What are the differences between the malware associated with the log file in the initial breach and its presence during lateral movement?,"The malware associated with the log file was initially discovered as a remnant in Workstation A, created on 29 August 2017. This malware had password dumping capability and was likely used to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement, forming part of the initial breach. The log file contained password credentials in plaintext. This same malware associated with the log file was also identified among the malware samples found during the attacker's lateral movements between December 2017 and June 2018. This indicates that the malware, or its remnants, persisted and continued to be a factor in the attacker's activities as they expanded control across the network, suggesting its continued utility for credential theft or other purposes during the later phases of the attack."
Compare the use of PowerShell commands to distribute malware with the copying of malicious files over mapped network drives.,"PowerShell commands were used by the attacker to distribute malware to infect other machines during privilege escalation and lateral movement. This implies using scripting to automate or facilitate the spread of malware. 'PowerShell commands' are instructions executed within the Windows PowerShell environment. Copying malicious files between machines over mapped network drives was another method used for lateral movement. 'Mapped network drives' are local drive letters that are assigned to network shares, allowing users to access network resources as if they were local. This method leverages existing network shares for file transfer. While both are methods for malware distribution during lateral movement, PowerShell commands represent an active scripting approach, whereas copying over mapped network drives is a file transfer method leveraging network shares."
What are the differences between the initial compromise of Workstation A and the attacker gaining full control over all Windows-based servers?,"The initial compromise of Workstation A involved the discovery of malicious artefacts and establishing control over this single workstation between August and December 2017. This was the first point of entry. Gaining full control over all Windows-based servers was a later stage, achieved after the attacker compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator credentials during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018). 'Windows-based servers' are computers designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers over a network, running a Windows Server operating system. The initial compromise was limited to one workstation, while full control over servers represents a significant expansion of control over critical network infrastructure."
Compare the initial compromise of Workstation A with the attacker gaining full control over all employee workstations.,"The initial compromise of Workstation A involved the discovery of malicious artefacts and establishing control over this single workstation between August and December 2017. This was the first point of entry. Gaining full control over all employee workstations was a later stage, achieved after the attacker compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator credentials during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018). 'Employee workstations' are the desktop or laptop computers used by personnel for their daily tasks. The initial compromise was limited to one workstation, while full control over all employee workstations represents a widespread compromise of user endpoints across the domain."
What are the differences between the initial compromise of Workstation A and the attacker gaining full control over all hosted applications?,"The initial compromise of Workstation A involved the discovery of malicious artefacts and establishing control over this single workstation between August and December 2017. This was the first point of entry. Gaining full control over all hosted applications was a later stage, achieved after the attacker compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator credentials during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018). 'Hosted applications' are software programs that run on a server and are accessed by users over a network. The initial compromise was limited to one workstation, while full control over all hosted applications represents a significant expansion of control over the software services available across the network."
Compare the initial compromise of Workstation A with the attacker gaining full control over all underlying data within the domain.,"The initial compromise of Workstation A involved the discovery of malicious artefacts and establishing control over this single workstation between August and December 2017. This was the first point of entry. Gaining full control over all underlying data within the domain was a later stage, achieved after the attacker compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator credentials during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018). 'Underlying data' refers to the raw information stored and processed by the systems across the network. The initial compromise was limited to one workstation, while full control over all underlying data represents a comprehensive compromise of all information assets across the entire domain."
What are the differences between the log file (as an artefact) and the publicly available hacking tool (as an artefact)?,"The log file was a remnant file from a known malware set, discovered in Workstation A. It contained password credentials in plaintext and had password dumping capability. It was a passive piece of evidence left behind by a prior malware infection. A 'log file' is a file that records events that occur in an operating system or other software. The publicly available hacking tool was an active piece of software installed on Workstation A by exploiting an Outlook vulnerability. It provided capabilities for persistent presence, remote interaction, brute force attacks, and serving as a backdoor. It was an active instrument used by the attacker. The log file was a trace, while the hacking tool was an operational component of the attack."
Compare the password dumping capability with the brute force attacks on email account passwords.,"Password dumping capability, associated with the malware remnant log file, refers to the ability to extract existing user account passwords directly from a system's memory or storage. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The log file itself contained password credentials in plaintext. Brute force attacks on email account passwords, a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, involve systematically trying many possible passwords until the correct one is found. This is an active guessing method. Thus, password dumping is an extraction method from an already compromised system or stored data, while brute force is an attempt to guess credentials, typically against an authentication service."
What are the differences between maintaining a persistent presence and serving as a hidden backdoor?,"Both capabilities were provided by the publicly available hacking tool. Maintaining a persistent presence refers to the ability of an attacker to retain access to a compromised email account even if the password to that account is subsequently changed. This ensures continuous access to a specific account. 'Persistent presence' refers to the ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. Serving as a hidden backdoor refers to the tool's ability to allow the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants are removed. A 'hidden backdoor' is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain remote access to a computer or network. While persistent presence focuses on continuous access to an account, a hidden backdoor provides a fallback mechanism for system re-entry if primary tools are removed."
Compare the remote interaction with mail exchange servers with the remote execution of shell scripts.,"Remote interaction with mail exchange servers was a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, allowing the attacker to control or access email infrastructure from a distance. 'Mail exchange servers' are dedicated computers or systems responsible for sending, receiving, and storing email messages. This is a specific type of remote action focused on email systems. Remote execution of shell scripts, a capability provided by RAT 1 and the hacking tool combined, refers to the attacker's ability to run command-line scripts on the compromised workstation from a remote location. 'Shell scripts' are programs designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell or Windows command prompt, automating tasks. While both involve remote control, one is specific to email server operations, and the other provides broader operating system command execution."
What are the differences between a vulnerability in Outlook and an uninstalled patch?,"A vulnerability in the version of 'Outlook' installed on Workstation A was the specific security flaw that the public hacking tool exploited to gain entry and install itself. A 'vulnerability' is a weakness or flaw in a system's security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that can be exploited by a threat source. The uninstalled patch refers to the available software update that would have fixed this specific vulnerability. A 'patch' is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. The vulnerability was the exploitable weakness, and the uninstalled patch was the failure to apply the corrective measure, which allowed the exploitation to succeed."
Compare malicious files masqueraded as .jpg image files with the actual malicious PowerShell scripts they contained.,"Malicious files masqueraded as .jpg image files refers to the deceptive outer appearance of some malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool. They were disguised to look like harmless image files to evade detection or trick users. 'Masquerading' means they were disguised to appear as legitimate image files. The actual malicious PowerShell scripts were the true content and executable payload hidden within these disguised files. 'PowerShell scripts' are sequences of commands executed by the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language, often used for system administration but can be exploited for malicious purposes. The .jpg image file was the camouflage, while the PowerShell script was the active threat."
What are the differences between the Cyber Kill Chain 'Delivery' phase and the 'Installation' phase?,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Delivery' phase refers to the transmission of the weaponized payload to the target. This is the stage where the attacker gets the malicious code to the victim's system. The 'Installation' phase, which typically follows Delivery and Exploitation, involves the attacker installing persistent access mechanisms on the target system, such as backdoors or Remote Access Trojans, to maintain access. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases, among others. Delivery is about getting the malware to the target, while Installation is about establishing a lasting presence on the target."
Compare the Cyber Kill Chain 'Exploitation' phase with the 'Command and Control' phase.,"In the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the 'Exploitation' phase involves the attacker triggering the weaponized payload to execute code on the target system, typically by exploiting a vulnerability. For example, the public hacking tool was installed by exploiting an Outlook vulnerability. The 'Command and Control' phase, which follows Installation, involves the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised system and issue commands. This allows the attacker to operate within the network. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. By 1 December 2017, the attacker had gone through both these phases, among others. Exploitation is about gaining initial code execution, while Command and Control is about maintaining and leveraging that access for ongoing operations."
What are the differences between compromising Citrix servers and compromising the Windows authentication system?,"Compromising Citrix servers located in SGH was part of the attacker's lateral movement between December 2017 and June 2018. These servers were connected to the SCM database, indicating a target for accessing specific applications or data. 'Citrix servers' are servers that host virtual applications and desktops. Compromising the Windows authentication system involved obtaining administrator and user credentials, which meant the attacker likely gained full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. 'Windows authentication system' refers to the mechanisms Windows uses to verify user identities. While compromising Citrix servers targets specific application infrastructure, compromising the Windows authentication system provides broader, foundational control over user identities and access across the entire domain."
Compare the log file (remnant of malware set) with the malware used for privilege escalation and lateral movement.,"The log file was a remnant file from a known malware set, discovered in Workstation A, which had password dumping capability. It contained password credentials in plaintext. This log file itself is an artefact, a trace of the malware. The malware associated with this log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. 'Privilege escalation' is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources. 'Lateral movement' is a technique that cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. The log file is the evidence, while the malware it's associated with is the active component performing the malicious actions for privilege escalation and lateral movement."
What are the differences between the capabilities of RAT 1 and the capabilities of RAT 2?,"RAT 1 was a customised Remote Access Trojan that provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. RAT 2 was another Remote Access Trojan referred to in the report, found during the attacker's lateral movements. While both are Remote Access Trojans, the document specifically details RAT 1's capabilities for direct workstation control. The document does not provide specific capabilities for RAT 2, only identifying it as another RAT used during the lateral movement phase, suggesting it likely had similar remote access functionalities but potentially with different characteristics or targets."
Compare the purpose of the publicly available hacking tool with the purpose of RAT 1.,"The publicly available hacking tool's purpose included maintaining a persistent presence once an email account was breached, interacting remotely with mail exchange servers, performing simple brute force attacks on email account passwords, and serving as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry. Its focus was on persistent access, email compromise, and re-entry. RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. Its purpose was direct remote control and data manipulation on the compromised workstation. While both are malicious tools, the hacking tool focused on broader access and persistence mechanisms, whereas RAT 1 specialized in direct operational control of a specific system."
What are the differences between the malware associated with the log file and RAT 2?,"The malware associated with the log file was a remnant from a known malware set that had password dumping capability and contained plaintext credentials. It was likely used for privilege escalation and lateral movement. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. RAT 2 was another Remote Access Trojan (RAT) found during the attacker's lateral movements. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance and control of a computer system. While both were involved in lateral movement, the malware associated with the log file was primarily characterized by its credential theft capabilities, whereas RAT 2 is identified as a tool for remote access and control, without specific details on its unique functions in the document."
Compare the initial breach period (August to December 2017) with the privilege escalation and lateral movement period (December 2017 to June 2018).,"The initial breach period, from August to December 2017, focused on the first evidence of compromise and establishing control over Workstation A. During this time, malicious artefacts like a log file, a publicly available hacking tool, and RAT 1 were discovered, and the attacker completed the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain. The privilege escalation and lateral movement period, from December 2017 to June 2018, followed the initial foothold. During this time, the attacker moved laterally in the network, compromising Citrix servers, proliferating malware (including RAT 1, RAT 2, and log file malware), using PowerShell commands to distribute malware, copying files over mapped network drives, and compromising the Windows authentication system to gain full control over the domain. The initial period was about gaining entry and initial control, while the later period was about expanding access, elevating privileges, and achieving widespread control across the network."
What are the differences between the capabilities provided by the hacking tool alone and the combined capabilities of the hacking tool and RAT 1?,"The hacking tool alone enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry. When combined with RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, the attacker gained the additional capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as to upload and download files to Workstation A. This indicates that while the hacking tool provided foundational access and persistence, RAT 1 augmented these with more direct and versatile remote control and file transfer functionalities over the workstation."
Compare the malware samples found during lateral movements that were 'stealthy by design' with those that were 'unique variants'.,"Both 'stealthy by design' malware and 'unique variants' were characteristics of the malware samples found during lateral movements that were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. 'Stealthy by design' refers to malware that is inherently engineered with features to avoid detection, such as obfuscation, anti-analysis techniques, or rootkit capabilities, making it difficult for security tools to identify its presence.

This novelty makes it difficult for signature-based detection to identify. The distinction is that 'stealthy by design' focuses on the inherent evasion mechanisms built into the malware, while 'unique variant' refers to the novelty or unfamiliarity of the malware's code or form, which also contributes to evasion."
What are the differences between the log file containing password credentials in plaintext and the malware having password dumping capability?,"The log file containing password credentials in plaintext refers to the state where passwords were found unencrypted and readable within the log file created on Workstation A. This is the direct evidence of compromised credentials. 'Plaintext' means data is in an unencrypted, readable format. The malware having password dumping capability refers to the functionality of the malware associated with that log file to extract user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. 'Password dumping' is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The capability is the action or function of the malware, while the plaintext credentials in the log file are the result or output of that capability, or another method of credential exposure."
Compare the initial implants being removed with the hacking tool serving as a hidden backdoor.,"The scenario of initial implants being removed refers to the possibility that the primary malicious tools or components initially installed on the system might be detected and eradicated. This would typically lead to a loss of attacker access. The hacking tool serving as a hidden backdoor is a countermeasure to this. A 'hidden backdoor' is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption to gain remote access to a computer or network. It allows the attacker to regain entry into the system even if the initial implants are removed, ensuring persistent access despite defensive actions. Thus, the removal of initial implants is a defensive action, and the hidden backdoor is an offensive mechanism to circumvent that defense."
What are the differences between interacting remotely with mail exchange servers and uploading and downloading files?,"Interacting remotely with mail exchange servers was a capability of the publicly available hacking tool, allowing the attacker to control or access email infrastructure from a distance. 'Mail exchange servers' are dedicated computers or systems responsible for sending, receiving, and storing email messages. This is a specific type of remote interaction focused on email systems. Uploading and downloading files was a capability provided by RAT 1 and the hacking tool, allowing the attacker to transfer any type of file to or from the compromised workstation. This is a general file transfer capability. While both are remote actions, one is specific to email server management, and the other is a broader function for data exfiltration or tool deployment."
