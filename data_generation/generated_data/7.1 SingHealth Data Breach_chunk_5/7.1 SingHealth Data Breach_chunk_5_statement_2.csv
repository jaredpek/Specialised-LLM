What were the three main malicious artefacts discovered by CSA in Workstation A between August and December 2017?,"Between August and December 2017, CSA discovered three main malicious artefacts in Workstation A: (i) a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, (ii) a publicly available hacking tool, and (iii) a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"". A malicious artefact is any piece of data or code found on a system that indicates a compromise or malicious activity."
Describe the nature and capability of the log file discovered in Workstation A.,"The log file discovered in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware which possessed password dumping capability. Password dumping is the process of extracting passwords from a computer's memory or storage, often used by attackers to gain further access. A log file is a file that records events that occur in an operating system or other software, or messages between different communications software."
What specific functions did 'RAT 1' enable the attacker to perform on Workstation A?,"'RAT 1' provided the attacker with the capability to access and control Workstation A. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system. Shell scripts are computer programs designed to be run by a command-line interpreter, automating tasks."
Explain how the publicly available hacking tool ensures persistent presence even after an email account password change.,"The publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account has been breached, even if the password to the account is subsequently changed. A persistent presence in cybersecurity refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period, despite potential detection or remediation efforts."
With which specific servers could the publicly available hacking tool interact remotely?,"The publicly available hacking tool allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers. Mail exchange servers are specialized servers responsible for sending, receiving, and routing email messages."
What was the target of the simple brute force attacks performed by the hacking tool?,The hacking tool allowed an attacker to perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) by systematically trying all possible combinations.
Under what condition would the hacking tool's hidden backdoor functionality be used?,"The hacking tool served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. A backdoor is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device."
