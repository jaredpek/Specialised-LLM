"Analyse the initial evidence of breach and control establishment on Workstation A, including the timeline.","The first evidence of breach and the establishment of control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017. During this period, CSA discovered several malicious artefacts on Workstation A. These included a log file, which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1""."
What was the significance of the log file discovered on Workstation A?,"The log file discovered on Workstation A was significant because it was a remnant file from a known malware that possessed password dumping capability. This log file was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017 and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. The malware associated with this log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n*   **Password dumping capability:** The ability of malware to extract password hashes or plaintext passwords from a system's memory or storage.\n*   **Plaintext:** Data stored or transmitted in an unencrypted, human-readable format.\n*   **Privilege escalation:** The act of gaining elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.\n*   **Lateral movement:** The techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access."
"Describe the capabilities of ""RAT 1"" as identified in the breach.","""RAT 1"" is a customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that provided the attacker with significant capabilities. Specifically, it enabled the attacker to access and control the compromised workstation. This control allowed the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files to and from the workstation.\n*   **Remote Access Trojan (RAT):** A type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control an infected computer.\n*   **Shell scripts:** Programs written for the command-line interpreter (shell) of an operating system, used to automate tasks."
Explain how the publicly available hacking tool contributed to the attacker's persistent presence.,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence on a system once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This capability is crucial for attackers as it allows them to retain access despite security measures like password resets.\n*   **Persistent presence:** The ability of an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period, often surviving reboots or password changes."
What additional functionalities did the hacking tool provide to the attacker beyond persistent presence?,"In addition to maintaining a persistent presence, the hacking tool provided the attacker with several other functionalities. These included the ability to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if the initial implants were removed.\n*   **Mail exchange servers:** Servers responsible for handling and routing email messages within an organization's network.\n*   **Brute force attacks:** A trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN).

Detail the installation process of the public hacking tool on Workstation A.,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 December 2017. Its installation was achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. A patch for this vulnerability was available at the time, but it had not been installed on Workstation A. The successful installation of this tool then allowed the attacker to download malicious files onto Workstation A.\n*   **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system or software that can be exploited by an attacker.\n*   **Patch:** A piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities."
Describe the nature of the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool.,"The malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool were masqueraded as .jpg image files. However, they actually contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts was identified as a modified PowerShell script taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool.\n*   **Masqueraded:** Disguised to appear as something else, in this case, a benign file type.\n*   **PowerShell scripts:** Programs written for Microsoft's PowerShell, a command-line shell and scripting language, often used for system administration but can be exploited for malicious purposes.\n*   **Post-exploitation tool:** Software used by attackers after they have gained initial access to a system to further their objectives, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration."
How did the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 enhance the attacker's capabilities by December 2017?,"By December 2017, with the introduction of both the hacking tool and RAT 1, the attacker significantly enhanced their capabilities.

What was the ultimate extent of control gained by the attacker after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker would have gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and the underlying data within the domain. This signifies a complete compromise of the organization's IT infrastructure.\n*   **Domain:** In a Windows network, a logical group of computers that share a common central directory database (Active Directory) and security policies."
