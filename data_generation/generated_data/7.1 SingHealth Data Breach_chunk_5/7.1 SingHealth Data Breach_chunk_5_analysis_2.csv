What were the initial malicious artefacts discovered by CSA in Workstation A between August and December 2017?,"Between August and December 2017, the CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A. These included a log file, which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"". A **log file** is a file that records events that occur in an operating system or other software, or messages between different communications. A **malware set** refers to a collection of malicious software components. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Analyse the capabilities of RAT 1 as discovered in Workstation A.,"RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with significant capabilities to access and control Workstation A. Specifically, it enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely. **Shell scripts** are computer programs designed to be run by the Unix shell or other command-line interpreters, often used for automating tasks. **Uploading** refers to the process of sending data from a local system to a remote system, while **downloading** is the process of receiving data from a remote system to a local system."
Describe the nature and content of the log file found in Workstation A.,"The log file discovered in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware. This specific malware had password dumping capability. The log file itself was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017 and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. A **log file** is a file that records events that occur in an operating system or other software, or messages between different communications. **Password dumping capability** refers to the ability of malware to extract passwords from a system's memory or storage. **Plaintext** refers to data that is not encrypted and is readable by humans or machines without special decryption."
What insights can be derived from the attacker's use of the publicly available hacking tool regarding persistent presence?,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence on a breached email account, even if the password to that account was subsequently changed. This indicates that the tool provided a mechanism for continued access that was not solely reliant on the initial password compromise. A **persistent presence** in cybersecurity refers to an attacker's ability to maintain long-term access to a compromised system or network, often surviving reboots or password changes. A **hacking tool** is a software program or utility designed to assist in exploiting vulnerabilities or gaining unauthorized access to computer systems."
Explain the functionalities of the publicly available hacking tool beyond maintaining persistent presence.,"Beyond maintaining a persistent presence, the publicly available hacking tool allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor. This backdoor functionality allowed the attacker to regain entry into the system even if the initial implants were removed. A **mail exchange server** is a server that handles and routes email messages. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers, typically involving automated attempts to guess every possible combination. A **backdoor** is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device, or its embodiment."
When was the log file created on Workstation A and what critical information did it contain?,"The log file was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017.

These completed phases included 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control'. The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. **Delivery** refers to the transmission of the attack payload to the target. **Exploitation** involves triggering a vulnerability to gain access. **Installation** is the stage where malware or backdoors are established for persistent access. **Command and Control** is when the attacker establishes remote communication with the compromised system to control it."
How did the attacker achieve lateral movement in the network after establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A?,"After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally in the network between December 2017 and June 2018. This lateral movement involved compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. **Lateral movement** refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. **Citrix servers** are servers that host applications and desktops, allowing users to access them remotely. The **SCM database** refers to a database related to the SCM (Supply Chain Management or System Configuration Management, contextually likely the latter in a healthcare setting) system."
What evidence supported the attacker's lateral movements across the network?,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. This widespread distribution of malicious software indicated the attacker's ability to move beyond the initial compromised Workstation A. **Lateral movement** refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise. **Malware** is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. An **endpoint** is any device that is physically an end point on a network, such as a workstation or server."
Characterize the malware samples discovered by CSA during the lateral movement phase.,"The malware samples found and analysed by CSA during the lateral movement phase were characterized in two ways: they were either tools that were stealthy by design, or they were unique variants not seen in-the-wild and not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This suggests sophisticated and evasive capabilities. **Malware** is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. **Stealthy by design** implies that the malware was specifically engineered to avoid detection. **In-the-wild** refers to malware that has been observed actively used in real-world attacks. **Anti-malware solutions** are software programs designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software."
