What was the timeframe for the first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A?,The first evidence of breach and the establishment of control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017.
What malicious artifacts did CSA discover in Workstation A?,"CSA discovered several malicious artifacts in Workstation A, including a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"". A **malware set** refers to a collection of malicious software components."
Describe the log file artifact found in Workstation A.,"The log file found in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware. This malware possessed password dumping capability, which is the ability to extract passwords from a system."
What capabilities did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1, a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control Workstation A. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system. **Shell scripts** are programs designed to be run by a command-line interpreter to automate tasks."
How did the publicly available hacking tool enable persistent presence for the attacker?,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. **Persistent presence** in cybersecurity refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period, even after initial detection or attempts to remove them."
What additional functions did the hacking tool allow an attacker to perform?,"In addition to maintaining persistent presence, the hacking tool allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if the initial implants were removed. **Mail exchange servers** are computer servers that handle the sending and receiving of email. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords, typically by trying many combinations. A **hidden backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, allowing remote access to the system."
When was the log file created on Workstation A and what did it contain?,"The log file was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017. The file contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A. **Password credentials in plaintext** means that the usernames and passwords were stored or transmitted in an unencrypted, readable format."
What was the likely purpose of the malware associated with the log file?,"The malware associated with the log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. **Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration vulnerability in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. **Lateral movement** refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network from an initial point of compromise."
How was the public hacking tool installed on Workstation A?,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 December 2017 by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was installed on the workstation. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker."
Why was the public hacking tool successfully installed on Workstation A despite a patch being available?,"The public hacking tool was successfully installed on Workstation A because, although a patch was available at that time to fix the vulnerability, the patch was not installed on Workstation A. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it."
What was the hacking tool used for after its installation?,"After its successful installation, the hacking tool was used to download malicious files onto Workstation A."
How were the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool disguised?,Some of the malicious files downloaded by the hacking tool were masqueraded as .jpg image files.
What did the disguised malicious files actually contain?,"The files masqueraded as .jpg image files in fact contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts is thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool. **PowerShell scripts** are sequences of commands written for the PowerShell command-line shell and scripting language, used for automating tasks and managing systems. A **post-exploitation tool** is software used by an attacker after gaining initial access to a system to further compromise it, gather information, or maintain access."
What new capabilities did the attacker gain with the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017?,"With the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017, the attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as to upload and download files to Workstation A."
Which phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework did the attacker complete by 1 December 2017?,"By 1 December 2017, the attacker was able to go through the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework."
What was the timeframe for privilege escalation and lateral movement in the network?,The privilege escalation and lateral movement in the network occurred between December 2017 and June 2018.
Where did the attacker move laterally in the network after establishing a foothold in Workstation A?,"After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally in the network by compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database."
What evidence indicated the attacker's lateral movements?,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. **Endpoints** are devices such as workstations, laptops, or mobile devices that connect to a network. **Servers** are computers or programs that manage access to a centralized resource or service in a network."
Describe the characteristics of the malware samples found during the lateral movement phase.,"Malware samples found and analyzed by CSA were either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild. These malware samples were also not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. **Anti-malware solutions** are software programs designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software."
What specific malware was included in the evidence of lateral movement?,"The malware included in the evidence of lateral movement comprised RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file."
How did the attacker distribute malware to infect other machines during lateral movement?,The attacker distributed malware to infect other machines by using PowerShell commands and by copying malicious files between machines over mapped network drives.
What did CSA assess regarding the attacker's compromise of authentication systems?,CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator and user credentials. The **Windows authentication system** is the mechanism by which Windows verifies the identity of users and services attempting to access resources.
What are administrator and user credentials?,"**Administrator and user credentials** refer to the usernames and passwords or other forms of authentication information that grant different levels of access and permissions within a system, with administrator credentials typically providing the highest level of control."
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. A **domain** in this context refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database and are managed by a central authority."

"What is the significance of a log file being a ""remnant of a malware set""?","A log file being a ""remnant of a malware set"" signifies that the file is a leftover trace or component from a collection of malicious software that was previously present or active on the system."
"What does ""password dumping capability"" mean in the context of malware?","""Password dumping capability"" in the context of malware means the ability of the malicious software to extract or steal passwords from a system's memory or storage, often for use in further attacks like privilege escalation or lateral movement."
What is a publicly available hacking tool?,"A publicly available hacking tool is a software utility or program that is readily accessible to the public and can be used for various hacking activities, such as maintaining persistent presence or performing brute force attacks."
"What does it mean for an email account to be ""breached""?","For an email account to be ""breached"" means that an unauthorized individual has gained access to it, typically by obtaining the account's password."
What is the purpose of a hidden backdoor in a compromised system?,"The purpose of a hidden backdoor in a compromised system is to allow an attacker to regain entry into the system, even if the initial implants or methods of compromise are removed."
What is the significance of password credentials being in plaintext?,"The significance of password credentials being in plaintext is that they are stored or transmitted in an unencrypted, human-readable format, making them highly vulnerable to discovery and exploitation by attackers without needing to decrypt them."
What is the role of malware in privilege escalation and lateral movement?,"Malware plays a crucial role in privilege escalation and lateral movement by being used to obtain passwords, exploit vulnerabilities, and establish footholds that allow attackers to gain higher access levels and spread across a network."
"What is a vulnerability in the context of software like ""Outlook""?","A vulnerability in the context of software like ""Outlook"" is a weakness or flaw in the program's code or design that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or cause the software to behave unexpectedly."
What is the importance of installing a patch for a software vulnerability?,"The importance of installing a patch for a software vulnerability is that it fixes the known weakness, thereby preventing attackers from exploiting that vulnerability to compromise the system or software."
"How were malicious files ""masqueraded as .jpg image files""?","Malicious files were ""masqueraded as .jpg image files"" by being disguised to appear as legitimate image files, likely by changing their file extension or metadata, to trick users or security systems into allowing them onto the system."
What is the function of PowerShell scripts in a cyberattack?,"The function of PowerShell scripts in a cyberattack is to automate malicious tasks, such as distributing malware, executing commands remotely, or performing post-exploitation activities on a compromised system."
"What does ""executing shell scripts remotely"" imply for an attacker?","""Executing shell scripts remotely"" implies that an attacker can run command-line programs and automate tasks on a compromised workstation from a distant location, without needing direct physical access."
What does the 'Delivery' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refer to in this context?,"In this context, the 'Delivery' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refers to the method by which the attacker transmitted the malicious tools, such as the hacking tool and RAT 1, to Workstation A."
What does the 'Exploitation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refer to in this context?,"In this context, the 'Exploitation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refers to the attacker's action of triggering a vulnerability, specifically in the ""Outlook"" version on Workstation A, to gain access."
What does the 'Installation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refer to in this context?,"In this context, the 'Installation' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refers to the attacker's action of establishing a persistent foothold on Workstation A, such as by installing the hacking tool and RAT 1."
What does the 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refer to in this context?,"In this context, the 'Command and Control' phase of the Cyber Kill Chain framework refers to the attacker's ability to communicate with and control the compromised Workstation A, enabling actions like remote script execution and file transfers."
What are Citrix servers and their relevance in this breach?,"Citrix servers are systems that provide virtualized applications and desktops. In this breach, they were relevant because they were located in SGH, connected to the SCM database, and were compromised by the attacker during lateral movement."
What is the SCM database?,The SCM database is a database that was connected to the Citrix servers located in SGH and was a target of the attacker's lateral movement after compromising Workstation A. (The document does not provide further details on what SCM stands for).
"What does ""proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers"" indicate?","""Proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers"" indicates that the malicious software had spread widely throughout the network, affecting multiple devices and central systems, which served as evidence of the attacker's lateral movements."
"What does it mean for malware to be ""stealthy by design""?","For malware to be ""stealthy by design"" means that it was intentionally created with features and techniques to evade detection by security software and remain hidden within a system."
"What does ""unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild"" imply about the malware?","""Unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild"" implies that the malware samples were either newly developed or significantly modified versions that had not been previously observed or documented by cybersecurity researchers or threat intelligence, making them harder to detect."
What is RAT 2?,"RAT 2 is another Remote Access Trojan, similar to RAT 1, that was identified as part of the malware proliferation during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase of the attack."
"What are ""mapped network drives"" in the context of malware distribution?","""Mapped network drives"" are local drive letters assigned to network shares, allowing users to access files on a remote server as if they were on their local computer. In the context of malware distribution, they were used by the attacker to copy malicious files between machines."
What is the significance of compromising the Windows authentication system?,"Compromising the Windows authentication system is significant because it allows an attacker to bypass standard security checks, impersonate legitimate users, and gain unauthorized access to resources, often leading to the acquisition of administrator and user credentials."
"What does ""underlying data within the domain"" refer to in the context of attacker control?","""Underlying data within the domain"" refers to all the information and files stored across the network, including on servers, applications, and employee workstations, which the attacker gained full control over after compromising the Windows authentication system."
