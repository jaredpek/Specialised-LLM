What was the first evidence of a breach discovered in Workstation A?,"The first evidence of a breach in Workstation A included the discovery of several malicious artefacts: a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1""."
"What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and what capabilities did ""RAT 1"" provide the attacker?","A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a computer system. ""RAT 1"" provided the attacker with the capability to access and control Workstation A, enabling them to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
Describe the log file discovered in Workstation A.,"The log file discovered in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware. This malware had password dumping capability, meaning it could extract passwords from the system. The log file itself was created on Workstation A on 29 August 2017 and contained password credentials in plaintext, which appeared to belong to the user of Workstation A."
What was the primary purpose of the malware associated with the log file?,"The malware associated with the log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for the purpose of privilege escalation and lateral movement. Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access."
How did the publicly available hacking tool enable an attacker to maintain a persistent presence?,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account is subsequently changed. This means the attacker could retain access despite password resets."
What additional functions did the hacking tool allow the attacker to perform?,"In addition to maintaining persistent presence, the hacking tool allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if the initial implants were removed. A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) by trying many combinations. A backdoor is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, a product, or an embedded device (such as a home router) or similar."
When was the public hacking tool installed on Workstation A and how was it installed?,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 December 2017. It was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of ""Outlook"" that was present on the workstation. A patch for this vulnerability was available at the time, but it had not been installed on Workstation A."
What types of malicious files were downloaded onto Workstation A using the hacking tool?,The hacking tool was used to download malicious files onto Workstation A. Some of these files were masqueraded as .jpg image files but actually contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts is believed to be a modified PowerShell script derived from an open-source post-exploitation tool. PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft.
"By what date had the attacker progressed through the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework?","The attacker was able to go through the 'Delivery', 'Exploitation', 'Installation', and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain framework by 1 December 2017. The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework used to describe the stages of a cyberattack.\n*   **Delivery** refers to how the attacker transmits the malware to the target.\n*   **Exploitation** refers to how the attacker exploits a vulnerability on the target system.\n*   **Installation** refers to how the attacker installs persistent access to the target.\n*   **Command and Control (C2)** refers to how the attacker maintains communication with the compromised system."
What new capabilities did the attacker gain in December 2017 with the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1?,"With the introduction of the hacking tool and RAT 1 in December 2017, the attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as to upload and download files to Workstation A. Shell scripts are computer programs designed to be run by the Unix shell or other command-line interpreters."
Describe the lateral movement observed after the initial foothold in Workstation A.,"After establishing an initial foothold in Workstation A, the attacker moved laterally in the network between December 2017 and June 2018. This lateral movement involved compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. Lateral movement is the technique cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access."
