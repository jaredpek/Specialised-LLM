"Compare the log file artefact with the customised Remote Access Trojan (""RAT 1"") found in Workstation A.","The log file was a remnant file from a known malware set that possessed password dumping capability. This means it could extract passwords from the system. In contrast, ""RAT 1"", a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, allowing them to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
"What are the differences between the capabilities of ""RAT 1"" and the publicly available hacking tool in Workstation A?","The customised Remote Access Trojan, ""RAT 1"", provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions like executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. The publicly available hacking tool, on the other hand, enabled the attacker to maintain a persistent presence even if an email account's password was changed, interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor to regain entry if initial implants were removed. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely. A **persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period, even after initial vulnerabilities are patched or credentials are changed. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords, by trying many combinations until the correct one is found. A **backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, allowing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext information."
"Contrast the purpose of the malware associated with the log file and the purpose of ""RAT 1"".","The malware associated with the log file was likely used by the attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement. The log file itself contained password credentials in plaintext. In contrast, ""RAT 1"", a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling them to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. **Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration vulnerability in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. **Lateral movement** refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access, often by compromising additional accounts and systems. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Compare the installation method of the public hacking tool with the nature of the log file.,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of \""Outlook\"" installed on the workstation. A patch for this vulnerability was available but not installed. The log file, however, was a remnant file from a known malware set that had password dumping capability and was created on Workstation A on August 29, 2017. It contained password credentials in plaintext. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it."
"What are the differences in the attacker's capabilities gained from ""RAT 1"" versus the public hacking tool in December 2017?","With the introduction of both the hacking tool and ""RAT 1"" in December 2017, the attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as to upload and download files to Workstation A. Specifically, ""RAT 1"" provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling these functions. The publicly available hacking tool also contributed to these capabilities and further allowed the attacker to maintain a persistent presence, interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks, and serve as a hidden backdoor. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely. **Shell scripts** are computer programs designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. **Persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. A **backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system."
Compare the initial evidence of breach artefacts found by CSA in Workstation A.,"CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A. These included a log file, which was a remnant of a malware set and had password dumping capability. Another artefact was a publicly available hacking tool. The third was a customised Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1"", which provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions like executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. A **log file** is a file that records events that occur in an operating system or other software. A **malware set** refers to a collection of malicious software. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Contrast the role of the log file in the breach with the role of the publicly available hacking tool.,"The log file was a remnant of a malware set that had password dumping capability, and it contained password credentials in plaintext. This suggests its role was primarily in credential harvesting for privilege escalation and lateral movement. The publicly available hacking tool, however, was installed by exploiting a vulnerability and was used to download malicious files. Its role was to establish and maintain a persistent presence, interact with mail exchange servers, perform brute force attacks, and serve as a hidden backdoor, indicating a broader role in maintaining access and control. **Password dumping** is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. **Privilege escalation** is gaining elevated access. **Lateral movement** is moving deeper into a network. A **persistent presence** is maintaining access over time. A **backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication."
What are the differences between the initial compromise of Workstation A and the subsequent lateral movement to Citrix servers?,"The initial compromise of Workstation A involved the discovery of malicious artefacts such as a log file, a publicly available hacking tool, and ""RAT 1"", which provided the attacker with control over the workstation. This phase occurred between August and December 2017. Subsequently, between December 2017 and June 2018, the attacker moved laterally in the network, compromising Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. This indicates an expansion of the breach beyond the initial workstation. **Lateral movement** refers to the techniques cyber attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network after gaining initial access. **Citrix servers** are servers that host virtual desktops and applications, often used for remote access."
Compare the attacker's methods for distributing malware with their methods for obtaining credentials.,"The attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware to infect other machines and copied malicious files between machines over mapped network drives. For obtaining credentials, the attacker utilized malware associated with a log file that had password dumping capability and contained plaintext password credentials. Additionally, CSA assessed that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system to obtain administrator and user credentials. **PowerShell commands** are instructions executed in the PowerShell scripting language, often used for system administration. **Mapped network drives** are local drive letters that connect to shared folders on a network. **Password dumping** is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. The **Windows authentication system** is the mechanism by which Windows verifies the identity of users and services."
Contrast the stealth characteristics of the malware used for lateral movements with standard anti-malware detection.,"Malware samples found and analyzed by CSA during the lateral movement phase were either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild. Crucially, these malware samples were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This contrasts with the expectation that standard anti-malware solutions would typically detect known or less sophisticated malware. **Stealthy by design** means the malware was specifically created to avoid detection. **Unique variants** are new or modified versions of malware that may not be recognized by existing signatures. **Standard anti-malware solutions** are software programs designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software."
"What are the differences between ""RAT 1"" and ""RAT 2""?","""RAT 1"" is described as a customised Remote Access Trojan discovered as an initial malicious artefact in Workstation A, providing the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload/download files. ""RAT 2"" is also referred to as a Remote Access Trojan and was identified as part of the malware proliferation across endpoints and servers during the lateral movement phase, indicating its use in expanding the attacker's control beyond the initial workstation. Both are **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**, which are types of malware that allow an attacker to control a system remotely."
Compare the types of files used for malicious purposes in Workstation A.,"Malicious files found in Workstation A included a log file that was a remnant of a malware set and contained password credentials in plaintext. Additionally, some malicious files downloaded by the public hacking tool were masqueraded as .jpg image files but in fact contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these PowerShell scripts was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. A **log file** records system events. **.jpg image files** are a common format for digital images. **PowerShell scripts** are programs executed via the PowerShell command-line shell, often used for system administration and automation. A **post-exploitation tool** is software used by attackers after gaining initial access to a system to further their objectives."
Contrast the attacker's initial control over Workstation A with their eventual full control over the domain.,"The attacker's initial control over Workstation A, established between August and December 2017, involved the capability to access and control the workstation, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload/download files, primarily through ""RAT 1"" and the hacking tool. Their eventual full control, achieved by compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, extended over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. This represents a significant escalation in the scope of compromise. A **domain** in this context refers to a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database and security policies. **Windows authentication system** is the mechanism for verifying user identities."
"What are the differences between a persistent presence and a hidden backdoor, as enabled by the hacking tool?","The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This means continuous access. The same hacking tool also served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. A **persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. A **hidden backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, specifically designed to allow an attacker to regain access if other means are removed."
Compare the exploitation of a vulnerability with the absence of a patch in the context of the hacking tool installation.,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of \""Outlook\"" that was installed on the workstation. This exploitation was possible because, although a patch was available at that time, it was not installed on Workstation A. Therefore, the exploitation of the vulnerability was directly facilitated by the absence of the available patch. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it."
"Contrast the capabilities of executing shell scripts remotely with uploading and downloading files, as provided by ""RAT 1"".","""RAT 1"" provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling them to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. Executing shell scripts remotely allows the attacker to run commands and automate tasks on the compromised system from a distant location. Uploading and downloading files, on the other hand, enables the attacker to exfiltrate data from the workstation or introduce additional malicious tools onto it. **Shell scripts** are computer programs designed to be run by a command-line interpreter. **Exfiltrate data** means to steal data from a system."
What are the differences between privilege escalation and lateral movement in the context of this breach?,"Privilege escalation and lateral movement were both objectives of the attacker. Privilege escalation involved obtaining passwords for higher-level access, such as administrator and user credentials, by compromising the Windows authentication system or using malware with password dumping capability. Lateral movement involved the attacker moving from Workstation A to other parts of the network, such as compromising Citrix servers and distributing malware to infect other machines over mapped network drives. Both are techniques used to expand control and access within a compromised network. **Privilege escalation** is the act of gaining elevated access to resources. **Lateral movement** refers to techniques attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network."
Compare the timeline of the log file creation with the installation of the public hacking tool.,"The log file was created on Workstation A on August 29, 2017. This file was a remnant of a malware set and contained password credentials in plaintext. The public hacking tool, however, was installed later, on December 1, 2017, by exploiting an \""Outlook\"" vulnerability. This indicates that the log file and its associated malware were present on the system earlier than the hacking tool. A **log file** is a file that records events. A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited."
Contrast the use of PowerShell commands for malware distribution with copying malicious files over mapped network drives.,"The attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware to infect other machines. This method leverages the scripting capabilities of PowerShell to automate and spread malicious code. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives. This method relies on direct file transfer across network shares. Both were techniques employed for malware propagation during the lateral movement phase. **PowerShell commands** are instructions executed in the PowerShell scripting language. **Mapped network drives** are local drive letters that connect to shared folders on a network. **Malware propagation** refers to the spread of malicious software across a network."
What are the differences between compromising Citrix servers and compromising the Windows authentication system?,"Compromising the Citrix servers located in SGH was a part of the attacker's lateral movement, as these servers were connected to the SCM database. This allowed the attacker to expand access within the network. Compromising the Windows authentication system, on the other hand, involved obtaining administrator and user credentials, which directly led to gaining full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. While both contribute to expanded access, compromising the authentication system provided a more fundamental and widespread level of control. **Citrix servers** host virtual desktops and applications. The **Windows authentication system** verifies user identities and manages access."
Compare the initial implants with the hidden backdoor functionality of the hacking tool.,"The publicly available hacking tool served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. This implies that 'initial implants' were the primary means of access established earlier, and the 'hidden backdoor' was a secondary, persistent mechanism to ensure continued access even if the initial compromise was detected and cleaned. A **hidden backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication to regain access. **Initial implants** refer to the first malicious software or tools placed on a compromised system."
Contrast the password dumping capability of the log file malware with the plaintext password credentials found in the log file.,"The log file was a remnant file from a known malware which had password dumping capability. This capability refers to the malware's function to extract passwords from the system. The log file itself contained password credentials in plaintext, meaning the passwords were stored in an unencrypted, readable format within the file. So, the capability describes the action the malware could perform, while the plaintext credentials describe the result of that action being stored in the log file. **Password dumping** is the process of extracting user account passwords from a system's memory or storage. **Plaintext** refers to data that is not encrypted and is readable by humans or computers without any special decryption."
"What are the differences between the malware set from which the log file was a remnant and the customised ""RAT 1""?","The log file was described as a 'remnant of a malware set,' implying it was a collection of malicious software, and this specific remnant had password dumping capability. In contrast, ""RAT 1"" was explicitly identified as a 'customised Remote Access Trojan,' indicating it was a specifically designed and tailored piece of malware intended to provide remote access and control over the workstation, with capabilities like executing shell scripts and file transfer. While both are malicious, the 'malware set' is a broader category from which a component (the log file remnant) originated, whereas ""RAT 1"" is a distinct, purpose-built Trojan. A **malware set** is a collection of malicious software. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Compare the masquerading of malicious files as .jpg image files with their actual content.,"Some malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A were masqueraded as .jpg image files. This means they were disguised to appear as harmless image files to evade detection. However, in fact, these files contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these PowerShell scripts was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. **Masquerading** is a technique where malicious files are disguised to appear as legitimate or harmless files. **.jpg image files** are a common format for digital images. **PowerShell scripts** are programs executed via the PowerShell command-line shell, often used for system administration and automation. A **post-exploitation tool** is software used by attackers after gaining initial access to a system to further their objectives."
"Contrast the brute force attacks on email account passwords with remote interaction with mail exchange servers, as enabled by the hacking tool.","The publicly available hacking tool allowed an attacker to perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password. This is a method focused on trying many password combinations until the correct one is found. The same tool also allowed the attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers. This capability enables direct manipulation or access to email infrastructure, potentially for sending/receiving emails or exfiltrating data. While both relate to email, brute force is about gaining password access, and remote interaction is about controlling the server itself. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords. **Mail exchange servers** are computer servers that handle and route email messages."
What are the differences between the 'Delivery' and 'Exploitation' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain in this breach?,"Referring to the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the attacker was able to go through the 'Delivery' and 'Exploitation' phases by December 1, 2017. The 'Delivery' phase would involve the attacker transmitting the malicious artefacts, such as the hacking tool and ""RAT 1"", to Workstation A. The 'Exploitation' phase would then involve the attacker leveraging a vulnerability, specifically the unpatched \""Outlook\"" vulnerability, to execute code on Workstation A and gain initial access. The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. **Delivery** is the phase where the attacker transmits the weaponized payload to the target. **Exploitation** is the phase where the attacker triggers the vulnerability to execute code on the target system."
Compare the 'Installation' and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain in this breach.,"Referring to the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the attacker was able to go through the 'Installation' and 'Command and Control' phases by December 1, 2017. The 'Installation' phase involved installing persistent access mechanisms, such as the hacking tool and ""RAT 1"", onto Workstation A. The 'Command and Control' phase then involved the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised Workstation A, enabling actions like executing shell scripts and uploading/downloading files. The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework that outlines the stages of a cyberattack. **Installation** is the phase where the attacker installs persistent access mechanisms. **Command and Control (C2)** is the phase where the attacker establishes remote communication with the compromised system."
Contrast the impact of the unpatched Outlook vulnerability with the availability of a patch.,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of \""Outlook\"" that was installed. This exploitation led to the successful installation of the tool and its use to download malicious files. This impact occurred despite the fact that a patch for this vulnerability was available at that time. The availability of the patch meant that the vulnerability could have been remediated, preventing the exploitation and subsequent installation of the hacking tool if it had been installed on Workstation A. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to fix or improve a program."
What are the differences between malware that is 'stealthy by design' and 'unique variants' not seen in-the-wild?,"Malware samples found during the lateral movement phase were either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild. 'Stealthy by design' refers to malware specifically engineered with features to avoid detection by security software. 'Unique variants not seen in-the-wild' refers to new or modified versions of malware that have not been previously observed or documented by security researchers, making them difficult for signature-based anti-malware solutions to detect. Both characteristics contribute to the malware's ability to evade detection. **Stealthy by design** means built to avoid detection. **Unique variants** are new or modified versions of malware."
Compare the compromise of Workstation A with the compromise of the SCM database.,"The initial compromise involved Workstation A, where malicious artefacts like a log file, a hacking tool, and ""RAT 1"" were discovered, giving the attacker control over that specific workstation. Subsequently, as part of lateral movement, the attacker compromised Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. This indicates that the SCM database was indirectly compromised through the Citrix servers, expanding the scope of the breach beyond just Workstation A. The **SCM database** is a database likely containing sensitive information, accessed via Citrix servers. **Workstation A** was the initial point of entry."
Contrast the password dumping capability with the use of PowerShell commands for privilege escalation.,"The password dumping capability, associated with the log file malware, allowed the attacker to obtain passwords directly from the system, which could then be used for privilege escalation. PowerShell commands, on the other hand, were used by the attacker to distribute malware to infect other machines, which could then lead to further privilege escalation by compromising those new machines or their credentials. While both contribute to privilege escalation, password dumping is a direct method of credential acquisition, whereas PowerShell commands are a method of malware distribution that can facilitate privilege escalation indirectly. **Password dumping** is extracting passwords from a system. **PowerShell commands** are instructions executed in the PowerShell scripting language. **Privilege escalation** is gaining elevated access."
"What are the differences between the log file being a 'remnant of a malware set' and ""RAT 1"" being a 'customised Remote Access Trojan'?","The log file was described as a 'remnant of a malware set,' implying it was a leftover component or trace from a broader collection of malicious software. This remnant specifically had password dumping capability. In contrast, ""RAT 1"" was explicitly identified as a 'customised Remote Access Trojan,' indicating it was a specifically designed and tailored piece of malware intended to provide remote access and control over the workstation, with capabilities like executing shell scripts and file transfer. While both are malicious, the 'malware set' is a broader category from which a component (the log file remnant) originated, whereas ""RAT 1"" is a distinct, purpose-built Trojan. A **malware set** is a collection of malicious software. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Compare the attacker's ability to access and control the workstation with their ability to execute shell scripts remotely.,"""RAT 1"" provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This overarching capability encompasses various actions. One specific function enabled by this control was the ability to execute shell scripts remotely. Therefore, executing shell scripts remotely is a particular action or method of control that falls under the broader capability of accessing and controlling the workstation. **Access and control the workstation** means having comprehensive remote management over the computer. **Executing shell scripts remotely** means running command-line programs on the workstation from a distant location."
Contrast the publicly available hacking tool's ability to perform brute force attacks with its ability to interact remotely with mail exchange servers.,"The publicly available hacking tool allowed an attacker to perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password. This is a method focused on guessing credentials. Separately, the tool also allowed the attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers. This capability suggests direct manipulation or querying of the email server infrastructure itself, which goes beyond just guessing a user's password. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method to obtain passwords. **Mail exchange servers** are computer servers that handle and route email messages."
What are the differences between the initial foothold in Workstation A and the lateral movement to other parts of the network?,"The initial foothold was established in Workstation A, evidenced by the discovery of malicious artefacts like the log file, hacking tool, and ""RAT 1"", which provided control over that specific workstation. This occurred between August and December 2017. Lateral movement, which took place between December 2017 and June 2018, describes the attacker's subsequent actions to move from Workstation A to other systems in the network, such as compromising Citrix servers and distributing malware to infect other machines. The initial foothold is the first point of entry and control, while lateral movement is the expansion of that control. A **foothold** is the initial access gained by an attacker into a system or network. **Lateral movement** refers to techniques attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network."
Compare the malicious PowerShell scripts with the open source post-exploitation tool they were derived from.,"Some malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A contained malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. This indicates that the attacker did not create the script entirely from scratch but adapted an existing, publicly available tool for their specific malicious purposes. The open source post-exploitation tool is the original, publicly available software, while the malicious PowerShell script is a modified version used in the attack. **PowerShell scripts** are programs executed via the PowerShell command-line shell. An **open source post-exploitation tool** is publicly available software used by attackers after gaining initial access to a system to further their objectives."
Contrast the attacker's ability to upload and download files with their ability to execute shell scripts remotely.,"""RAT 1"" provided the attacker with the capability to upload and download files to Workstation A. This allows for data exfiltration or the introduction of new malicious tools. Concurrently, ""RAT 1"" also enabled the attacker to execute shell scripts remotely. This allows for direct command execution and automation of tasks on the compromised system. Both are critical remote control capabilities, but file transfer focuses on data and tools, while script execution focuses on command-line operations. **Uploading and downloading files** refers to transferring data between the attacker's system and the compromised workstation. **Executing shell scripts remotely** means running command-line programs on the workstation from a distant location."
What are the differences between the malware associated with the log file and the malware that was stealthy by design or unique variants?,"The malware associated with the log file had password dumping capability and was likely used for privilege escalation and lateral movement. This malware was present early in the breach (log file created August 2017). In contrast, during the later lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018), malware samples found were specifically noted as being either stealthy by design or unique variants not seen in-the-wild, and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This suggests a potential evolution or diversification in the types of malware used, with a focus on evasion for the later stages. **Password dumping capability** is the ability to extract passwords. **Stealthy by design** means built to avoid detection. **Unique variants** are new or modified versions of malware."
Compare the compromise of the Windows authentication system with the compromise of Citrix servers.,"The compromise of the Windows authentication system allowed the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials, leading to full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. This is a direct compromise of the core identity and access management system. The compromise of Citrix servers, located in SGH and connected to the SCM database, was a part of lateral movement, providing access to specific application hosting infrastructure and potentially the database it connected to. While both expanded the attacker's reach, the Windows authentication system compromise provided a more foundational and widespread level of control. The **Windows authentication system** verifies user identities. **Citrix servers** host virtual desktops and applications."
Contrast the publicly available hacking tool's ability to maintain a persistent presence with its function as a hidden backdoor.,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This describes the continuous, ongoing access. The same hacking tool also served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. The hidden backdoor is a specific mechanism for re-entry, particularly useful if other access methods are compromised, whereas persistent presence is the broader state of continuous access. A **persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access over an extended period. A **hidden backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication to regain access."
What are the differences between the malicious artefacts discovered initially and the malware found during lateral movements?,"Initially, in Workstation A (August-December 2017), CSA discovered a log file (remnant of malware with password dumping capability), a publicly available hacking tool, and a customised Remote Access Trojan (""RAT 1""). During the lateral movement phase (December 2017-June 2018), evidence of malware proliferation across endpoints and servers was found. This malware included ""RAT 1"", another Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and the malware associated with the earlier-mentioned log file. These later-stage malware samples were noted for being stealthy by design or unique variants not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This indicates an overlap (""RAT 1"", log file malware) but also the introduction of new elements (""RAT 2"") and a focus on evasion for lateral spread. A **malicious artefact** is any object found on a system that indicates malicious activity. **Lateral movement** refers to techniques attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network."
Compare the attacker's control over Workstation A with their control over all employee workstations within the domain.,"The attacker's initial control over Workstation A, established between August and December 2017, involved the capability to access and control that specific workstation, execute shell scripts remotely, and upload/download files. Their eventual full control, achieved by compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, extended to all employee workstations within the domain, along with all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, and underlying data. This represents a significant expansion from control over a single workstation to comprehensive control over all user endpoints in the entire domain. A **workstation** is a computer used by an individual. A **domain** is a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database and security policies."
Contrast the password credentials in plaintext with the password dumping capability.,"The log file contained password credentials in plaintext, meaning the passwords were stored in an unencrypted, readable format within the file. This is the state of the data. The malware associated with this log file had password dumping capability, which refers to the function or ability of the malware to extract or 'dump' these passwords from the system's memory or storage. So, plaintext credentials are the *result* or *form* of the passwords, while password dumping capability is the *method* used to obtain them. **Plaintext** refers to data that is not encrypted and is readable. **Password dumping capability** is the ability of malware to extract user account passwords."
What are the differences between the malware used for initial breach and the malware used for lateral movement in terms of detection?,"The document does not explicitly state the detection status of the malware used for the initial breach (log file malware, ""RAT 1"", public hacking tool) at the time of their initial discovery. However, for the malware samples found during the lateral movement phase (which included ""RAT 1"", ""RAT 2"", and the log file malware), it is specifically noted that they were either stealthy by design or unique variants not seen in-the-wild, and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This highlights a significant challenge in detecting the malware used for lateral movement. **Initial breach** refers to the first successful unauthorized access. **Lateral movement** refers to techniques attackers use to progressively move deeper into a network. **Stealthy by design** means built to avoid detection. **Unique variants** are new or modified versions of malware."
Compare the exploitation of an Outlook vulnerability with the general concept of a vulnerability.,"The public hacking tool was installed by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of \""Outlook\"" installed on Workstation A. This is a specific instance of a vulnerability being leveraged. A **vulnerability** is a general term for a weakness in a system, software, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions. The \""Outlook\"" vulnerability is a concrete example of such a weakness. **Exploiting a vulnerability** means taking advantage of that weakness to achieve a malicious objective."
Contrast the attacker's ability to interact remotely with mail exchange servers with performing simple brute force attacks on email account passwords.,"The publicly available hacking tool allowed the attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, which implies direct control or manipulation of the email infrastructure itself. This could involve sending, receiving, or exfiltrating emails. In contrast, performing simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password is a method focused on guessing the password to gain access to a specific email account, rather than controlling the server. Both relate to email, but one is about server control and the other about account access via password guessing. **Mail exchange servers** are computer servers that handle and route email messages. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords."
What are the differences between the log file being a 'remnant' and the hacking tool being 'installed'?,"The log file was described as a 'remnant of a malware set,' suggesting it was a leftover or trace file from a previous malicious activity or a component of a larger malware package. It was created on August 29, 2017. The hacking tool, on the other hand, was actively 'installed' on Workstation A on December 1, 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability. This implies a more deliberate and active deployment process for the hacking tool compared to the log file being a residual component. A **remnant** is a small remaining part of something. **Installed** means the software was set up and configured on the system for use."
Compare the attacker's control over Windows-based servers and hosted applications with their control over underlying data within the domain.,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications. This refers to the operational control over the computing infrastructure and the software running on it. Concurrently, they also gained full control over the underlying data within the domain. This means they had access to and could manipulate the actual information stored across the network. Control over servers and applications provides the means, while control over data is the ultimate objective for many attackers. **Windows-based servers** are computers that provide services to other computers on a network using the Windows operating system. **Hosted applications** are software programs run on servers and accessed by users. **Underlying data** refers to the information stored and processed within the network."
Contrast the initial breach period (August-December 2017) with the privilege escalation and lateral movement period (December 2017-June 2018).,"The initial breach period, from August to December 2017, focused on establishing control over Workstation A, evidenced by the discovery of artefacts like the log file, a hacking tool, and ""RAT 1"". This phase involved gaining initial access and establishing a foothold. The privilege escalation and lateral movement period, from December 2017 to June 2018, describes the attacker's actions *after* establishing that initial foothold. During this later period, the attacker moved laterally in the network, compromised Citrix servers, distributed malware, and obtained administrator credentials to gain full control over the domain. The first period is about initial compromise, the second is about expanding and deepening that compromise. **Initial breach** is the first successful unauthorized access. **Privilege escalation** is gaining elevated access. **Lateral movement** is moving deeper into a network."
"What are the differences between the capabilities provided by ""RAT 1"" and the capabilities provided by the malware associated with the log file?","""RAT 1"", a customised Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files. The malware associated with the log file, from which the log file was a remnant, had password dumping capability. This means its primary function was to extract passwords from the system. While both are malicious, ""RAT 1"" offers broad remote control and file manipulation, whereas the log file malware is specifically focused on credential harvesting. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely. **Password dumping capability** is the ability to extract user account passwords from a system."
Compare the attacker's ability to maintain a persistent presence with their ability to interact remotely with mail exchange servers.,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This refers to the continuous, ongoing access to the system. Separately, the same hacking tool also allowed an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers. This capability focuses on direct engagement with the email infrastructure. While both are enabled by the hacking tool, persistent presence is about maintaining general access, and remote interaction with mail servers is a specific function performed with that access. A **persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. **Mail exchange servers** are computer servers that handle and route email messages."
Contrast the use of a modified PowerShell script with a script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool.,"Some malicious files contained malicious PowerShell scripts, one of which was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. This means the attacker did not use the open source tool's script as-is, but rather adapted or altered it for their specific attack. The original script from the open source post-exploitation tool serves as the base, while the modified PowerShell script is the version customized and deployed by the attacker. **PowerShell scripts** are programs executed via the PowerShell command-line shell. An **open source post-exploitation tool** is publicly available software used by attackers after gaining initial access to a system to further their objectives."
What are the differences between the malware used for password dumping and the malware used for remote control of the workstation?,"The malware associated with the log file had password dumping capability, meaning its primary function was to extract passwords from the system. This was likely used for privilege escalation and lateral movement. In contrast, ""RAT 1"", a customised Remote Access Trojan, was designed to provide remote access and control over the workstation, enabling functions such as executing shell scripts remotely and uploading and downloading files. While both are malicious, their core functionalities differ: one focuses on credential harvesting, the other on comprehensive remote system management. **Password dumping capability** is the ability to extract user account passwords. **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely."
Compare the exploitation of an Outlook vulnerability with the general concept of a patch.,"The public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of \""Outlook\"" that was installed. This exploitation was successful because a patch, which was available at that time, was not installed on Workstation A. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker. A **patch** is a piece of software designed to update a computer program or its supporting data, to fix or improve it, thereby addressing vulnerabilities. The exploitation occurred due to the presence of the vulnerability and the absence of the patch."
Contrast the attacker's ability to compromise the Windows authentication system with their ability to obtain administrator and user credentials.,"CSA assessed that the attacker is likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system. This refers to gaining unauthorized access to or control over the system responsible for verifying user identities and managing access. As a direct result of compromising this system, the attacker obtained administrator and user credentials. Therefore, compromising the Windows authentication system is the method or action, and obtaining administrator and user credentials is the outcome or specific asset acquired through that compromise. The **Windows authentication system** is the mechanism by which Windows verifies the identity of users and services. **Administrator and user credentials** are the usernames and passwords or other authentication factors for accounts with different levels of privilege."
What are the differences between the 'Delivery' and 'Installation' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain in this breach?,"Referring to the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the attacker was able to go through the 'Delivery' and 'Installation' phases by December 1, 2017. The 'Delivery' phase involved the attacker transmitting the malicious artefacts, such as the hacking tool and ""RAT 1"", to Workstation A. The 'Installation' phase then involved the attacker installing persistent access mechanisms, like the hacking tool and ""RAT 1"", onto Workstation A, ensuring continued access. **Delivery** is the phase where the attacker transmits the weaponized payload to the target. **Installation** is the phase where the attacker installs persistent access mechanisms on the target system."
Compare the 'Exploitation' and 'Command and Control' phases of the Cyber Kill Chain in this breach.,"Referring to the Cyber Kill Chain framework, the attacker was able to go through the 'Exploitation' and 'Command and Control' phases by December 1, 2017. The 'Exploitation' phase involved the attacker leveraging a vulnerability, specifically the unpatched \""Outlook\"" vulnerability, to execute code on Workstation A and gain initial access. The 'Command and Control' phase then involved the attacker establishing a communication channel to remotely control the compromised Workstation A, enabling actions like executing shell scripts and uploading/downloading files. **Exploitation** is the phase where the attacker triggers a vulnerability to execute code on the target system. **Command and Control (C2)** is the phase where the attacker establishes remote communication with the compromised system."
"Contrast the malware associated with the log file with ""RAT 2"".","The malware associated with the log file was a remnant of a malware set that had password dumping capability, and it was present early in the breach (log file created August 29, 2017). It was likely used for privilege escalation and lateral movement. ""RAT 2"", on the other hand, is another Remote Access Trojan that was identified during the later lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018) as part of the proliferation of malware across endpoints and servers. While both are malware used for lateral movement, the log file malware is characterized by password dumping, whereas ""RAT 2"" is identified as a Remote Access Trojan, implying remote control capabilities. A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that allows an attacker to control a system remotely. **Password dumping capability** is the ability to extract user account passwords."
What are the differences between the attacker gaining full control over Windows-based servers and gaining full control over hosted applications?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications. Gaining full control over Windows-based servers means having complete administrative access to the physical or virtual machines running the Windows operating system. Gaining full control over hosted applications means having complete administrative access to the software applications that are running on those servers. While closely related, control over servers is control over the underlying infrastructure, and control over applications is control over the specific software services provided. **Windows-based servers** are computers that provide services to other computers on a network using the Windows operating system. **Hosted applications** are software programs run on servers and accessed by users."
Compare the publicly available hacking tool's ability to perform simple brute force attacks with its ability to serve as a hidden backdoor.,"The publicly available hacking tool allowed an attacker to perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password. This is a method of trying many password combinations to gain initial access to an account. Separately, the same hacking tool also served as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that the initial implants were removed. The brute force attack is a technique for initial credential acquisition, while the hidden backdoor is a mechanism for maintaining long-term, covert access. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords. A **hidden backdoor** is a covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, allowing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext information."
Contrast the malicious files masqueraded as .jpg image files with the malicious PowerShell scripts they contained.,"Some malicious files downloaded onto Workstation A were masqueraded as .jpg image files, meaning they were disguised to appear as harmless image files to evade detection. The actual content of these files, however, was malicious PowerShell scripts. One of these scripts was thought to be a modified PowerShell script taken from an open source post-exploitation tool. So, the .jpg image file was the deceptive outer layer, while the PowerShell script was the actual executable malicious payload. **Masquerading** is a technique where malicious files are disguised to appear as legitimate or harmless files. **.jpg image files** are a common format for digital images. **PowerShell scripts** are programs executed via the PowerShell command-line shell, often used for system administration and automation."
What are the differences between the attacker's initial foothold in Workstation A and the compromise of the SCM database?,"The attacker established an initial foothold in Workstation A between August and December 2017, gaining control over that specific workstation through artefacts like the log file, hacking tool, and ""RAT 1"". The compromise of the SCM database, however, occurred later (between December 2017 and June 2018) as part of the attacker's lateral movement, by compromising Citrix servers located in SGH that were connected to the SCM database. The initial foothold was the entry point, while the SCM database compromise was a subsequent, expanded target reached through lateral movement. A **foothold** is the initial access gained by an attacker into a system or network. The **SCM database** is a database likely containing sensitive information, accessed via Citrix servers."
Compare the password dumping capability of the log file malware with the obtaining of administrator and user credentials through the Windows authentication system.,"The malware associated with the log file had password dumping capability, which is the ability to extract passwords from the system, and the log file itself contained plaintext password credentials. This is one method of credential acquisition. Separately, CSA assessed that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system to obtain administrator and user credentials. This indicates another, potentially more comprehensive, method of acquiring high-privilege credentials by targeting the core authentication mechanism. **Password dumping capability** is the ability to extract user account passwords. The **Windows authentication system** is the mechanism by which Windows verifies the identity of users and services. **Administrator and user credentials** are the usernames and passwords or other authentication factors for accounts with different levels of privilege."
Contrast the attacker's ability to execute shell scripts remotely with their ability to upload and download files to Workstation A.,"With the introduction of the hacking tool and ""RAT 1"" in December 2017, the attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as to upload and download files to Workstation A. Executing shell scripts remotely allows the attacker to run commands and automate tasks on the compromised system from a distant location. Uploading and downloading files, on the other hand, enables the attacker to exfiltrate data from the workstation or introduce additional malicious tools onto it. Both are critical remote control capabilities, but script execution focuses on command-line operations, while file transfer focuses on data and tools. **Shell scripts** are computer programs designed to be run by a command-line interpreter. **Uploading and downloading files** refers to transferring data between the attacker's system and the compromised workstation."
What are the differences between the malware being 'stealthy by design' and 'not detected by standard anti-malware solutions'?,"Malware samples found during the lateral movement phase were either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that were not seen in-the-wild, and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. 'Stealthy by design' refers to the inherent characteristic of the malware, meaning it was intentionally created with features to avoid detection. 'Not detected by standard anti-malware solutions' is the observed outcome or consequence of that stealthy design (or uniqueness). So, one is the cause (design characteristic), and the other is the effect (evasion of detection). **Stealthy by design** means built to avoid detection. **Standard anti-malware solutions** are software programs designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software."
Compare the attacker's control over all Windows-based servers with their control over all employee workstations within the domain.,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and all employee workstations within the domain. Control over Windows-based servers means administrative access to the machines providing network services and hosting applications. Control over all employee workstations means administrative access to the individual computers used by personnel. Both represent comprehensive control over different types of computing assets within the domain, contributing to the attacker's widespread access. **Windows-based servers** are computers that provide services to other computers on a network using the Windows operating system. **Employee workstations** are the individual computers used by employees. A **domain** is a group of computers and devices on a network that share a common directory database and security policies."
Contrast the publicly available hacking tool's ability to maintain a persistent presence with its ability to perform simple brute force attacks.,"The publicly available hacking tool enabled an attacker to maintain a persistent presence once an email account had been breached, even if the password to the account was subsequently changed. This refers to the continuous, ongoing access to the system. The same hacking tool also allowed an attacker to perform simple brute force attacks on the user's email account password. This is a method of trying many password combinations to gain initial access to an account. Persistent presence is about maintaining access over time, while brute force attacks are a method for initial credential acquisition. A **persistent presence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system over an extended period. A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user passwords."
