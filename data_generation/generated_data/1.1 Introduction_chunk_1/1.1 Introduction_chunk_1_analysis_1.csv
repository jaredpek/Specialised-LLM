How long did the attackers remain undetected in the Target network?,The attackers in the **Target Attack** remained undetected within Target's network for more than two weeks. This extended period allowed them to collect a significant amount of credit card data before their presence was discovered.
What made the Target malware difficult to detect?,The **Target malware** was difficult to detect because it contained a new attack method designed to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. This sophisticated technique made it challenging for security researchers to identify and trace the malicious activities.
"Compare and contrast ""Trojan.POSRAM"" and ""BlackPOS"" based on the document.","Based on the document, ""Trojan.POSRAM"" and ""BlackPOS"" are both types of POS malware. The code of ""Trojan.POSRAM"" bears a strong resemblance to ""BlackPOS,"" indicating a shared lineage or similar functionality. However, the Target malware, which utilized ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" contained a new attack method that specifically evaded forensic detection and concealed data transfers, suggesting an evolution or enhancement over earlier ""BlackPOS"" variants."
What is the overall definition of computer security as presented in the document?,"The overall definition of **computer security** presented in the document is to guarantee the correct usage of computer systems and their desired properties, specifically in the presence of malicious entities. This encompasses ensuring functionality and integrity against intentional harm or unauthorized access."
"Discuss the concept of ""dependability"" in security engineering according to Rose Anderson.","According to Rose Anderson, **dependability** in security engineering refers to the ability of systems to consistently perform their intended functions and maintain their desired properties even when confronted with adverse conditions. These adverse conditions include **malice** (intentional harm), **error** (unintentional flaws), or **mischance** (unforeseen circumstances)."
What are the three categories of threats mentioned by Rose Anderson that security engineering aims to address?,"Rose Anderson mentions three categories of threats that security engineering aims to address: **malice**, **error**, and **mischance**. **Malice** refers to intentional harmful acts, **error** to unintentional mistakes or flaws, and **mischance** to unforeseen or unfortunate circumstances that could compromise system dependability."
"Explain the difference between ""random faults"" and an ""intelligent and malicious adversary"" in Bruce Schneier's view of security.","In Bruce Schneier's view of security, the key difference lies in the nature of the threat. **Random faults** are unintentional system failures or errors that occur without malicious intent. An **intelligent and malicious adversary**, however, is a conscious entity actively and deliberately trying to ensure that systems fail in the worst possible way, at the worst possible time, and repeatedly, making security a much more challenging endeavor than simply guarding against accidental issues."
Provide examples of how computer security failures can lead to blackouts and water contamination.,"Computer security failures can lead to **blackouts** by compromising the control systems of the **power grid**, causing widespread power outages. Similarly, they can lead to **water contamination** by disrupting the operational controls of **water systems**, potentially allowing untreated water into the supply or interfering with purification processes."
How can compromised smart home systems pose a threat to physical safety?,"Compromised **smart home systems** can pose a threat to physical safety by allowing unauthorized control over critical household devices. For instance, hackers could manipulate **thermostats** to create unsafe temperature levels or unlock **locks**, granting unauthorized access to the home and potentially endangering its occupants."
"What specific information was targeted in the SingHealth breach, beyond general patient data?","Beyond general patient data, the **SingHealth breach** specifically targeted and stole the outpatient prescriptions of 160,000 people. This group included high-profile individuals such as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and a few ministers, whose information was noted as being ""specifically and repeatedly targeted."""
"What is a ""RAM scraper"" as described in the Target Attack case study?","A **RAM scraper**, as described in the Target Attack case study, is a type of malware, specifically exemplified by ""Trojan.POSRAM."" Its function is to collect unencrypted payment card information directly from a Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal's memory (RAM) just after the card has been swiped, before it can be encrypted or processed further."
"Discuss the role of a ""third-party file sharing system"" in the Singtel data breach.","A **third-party file sharing system** played a crucial role in the Singtel data breach. The personal data of 129,000 Singtel customers, along with details of former employees and corporate customers, was extracted by hackers from this system, which was utilized by Singtel. This highlights the supply chain risk associated with relying on external services for data management."
"Why are insider attacks considered more damaging, as illustrated by the Throwback Attack?","Insider attacks are considered more damaging, as illustrated by the **Throwback Attack**, because the attacker often possesses **specialized knowledge** of the target systems and the **ability to manipulate control systems**. This intimate understanding allows them to exploit vulnerabilities more effectively and cause more significant harm, as seen with Vitek Boden's cyber assault on the waste management system."
"What is the primary goal of ""Ransomware""?","The primary goal of **Ransomware** is to encrypt a user's personal files, making them inaccessible, and then demand payment for their release. This effectively holds the user's data hostage, forcing them to pay a ransom to regain access to their own information."
"How do ""Malicious mobile apps"" collect private data?","**Malicious mobile apps** collect private data by performing unauthorized collection of sensitive information from a user's mobile device. This can include accessing and transmitting location data, contact lists, or other private data without the user's explicit consent or knowledge."
What is the core principle of computer security according to the initial definition?,"The core principle of **computer security**, according to its initial definition, is to guarantee the correct usage of computer systems and their desired properties. This guarantee must hold even when faced with the challenge of **malicious entities** attempting to undermine or exploit the system."
What is the significance of the Jeep Hack in demonstrating the impact of computer security failures?,"The **Jeep Hack** is significant in demonstrating the impact of computer security failures because it showed that physical systems, specifically vehicles, can be remotely compromised. The ability of hackers to control critical functions like air-conditioning, radio, windshield wipers, and even cut the transmission of a moving car highlights the direct and severe physical safety risks posed by inadequate computer security in modern connected devices."
Explain how computer security is critical to physical safety in the context of factory automation.,"In the context of **factory automation**, computer security is critical to physical safety because a breach can lead to the sabotage of industrial processes. This sabotage can directly cause **equipment failure** or even **explosions**, which pose immediate and severe physical threats to personnel working in the factory and can result in significant property damage."
"What kind of sensitive information is typically targeted by ""Phishing"" attacks?","**Phishing** attacks typically target sensitive information such as user credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords), financial information (e.g., bank account details, credit card numbers), and other personal data. The goal is to trick users into revealing this information, which can then be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to accounts."
