Provide a comprehensive summary of what computer security entails.,"Computer security is defined as guaranteeing the correct usage of computer systems and their desired properties, even in the presence of malicious entities. Security engineering focuses on building systems that remain dependable when faced with malice, error, or mischance. Dependable, in this context, means the system continues to operate correctly and reliably despite adverse conditions or intentional attacks. It involves ensuring that systems function correctly, not just in the presence of random faults, but specifically against an intelligent and malicious adversary who actively tries to make things fail in the worst possible way, repeatedly. This concept is likened to 'programming Satan's computer'."
