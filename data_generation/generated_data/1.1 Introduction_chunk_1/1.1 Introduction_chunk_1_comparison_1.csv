Compare the general definition of Computer Security with Rose Anderson's definition of Security Engineering.,"Computer Security is generally defined as guaranteeing the correct usage of computer systems and desired properties in the presence of malicious entities. A **malicious entity** refers to any agent or force that intends to cause harm or disruption to a computer system or its data.\n\nRose Anderson's definition of **Security Engineering**, on the other hand, focuses on building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance. **Dependable** in this context means the system can be relied upon to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently. **Malice** refers to intentional harmful acts, **error** refers to unintentional faults or mistakes, and **mischance** refers to unforeseen or accidental events that could compromise a system's integrity or availability. While the general definition is broad, Anderson's definition specifically highlights the engineering aspect of building resilient systems against various forms of failure, including intentional attacks (malice) and unintentional issues (error, mischance)."
What are the differences between Rose Anderson's and Bruce Schneier's perspectives on security?,"Rose Anderson views **Security Engineering** as the process of building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance. This perspective emphasizes the proactive construction of resilient systems that can withstand various threats, both intentional and unintentional. **Dependable** means the system can be relied upon to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently. **Malice** refers to intentional harmful acts, **error** refers to unintentional faults or mistakes, and **mischance** refers to unforeseen or accidental events.\n\nBruce Schneier's perspective on **Security** involves making sure things work, not in the presence of random faults, but specifically in the face of an intelligent and malicious adversary trying to ensure that things fail in the worst possible way at the worst possible time, repeatedly. He describes this as ""programming Satan's computer."" Schneier's definition highlights the adversarial nature of security, focusing on an active, intelligent opponent rather than just general faults or mischance. An **intelligent and malicious adversary** is a sophisticated attacker who deliberately seeks to exploit vulnerabilities and cause maximum damage or disruption. The key difference lies in Anderson's broader inclusion of errors and mischance, while Schneier specifically emphasizes the challenge posed by a persistent, intelligent, and malicious human adversary."
