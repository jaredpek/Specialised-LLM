Define the concept of Computer Security.,"Computer Security is defined as the guarantee of the correct usage of computer systems and their desired properties, even in the presence of malicious entities. Malicious entities are individuals or groups with harmful intentions who seek to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems."
Explain Rose Anderson's perspective on security engineering.,"Rose Anderson, a Professor at the University of Cambridge, views security engineering as the process of building systems that are designed to remain dependable even when faced with malice, error, or mischance. Dependability, in this context, refers to the ability of a system to perform its intended function correctly and consistently under various adverse conditions, including intentional harm (malice), unintentional mistakes (error), or unforeseen circumstances (mischance)."
Summarize Bruce Schneier's view on security.,"Bruce Schneier, an Adjunct Lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School, describes security as ensuring that things work as intended, not just in the face of random faults, but specifically when confronted by an intelligent and malicious adversary. This adversary actively tries to make systems fail in the worst possible way, at the worst possible time, repeatedly. Schneier characterizes this challenge as ""programming Satan's computer,"" highlighting the complex and persistent nature of threats from intelligent, malevolent actors."
