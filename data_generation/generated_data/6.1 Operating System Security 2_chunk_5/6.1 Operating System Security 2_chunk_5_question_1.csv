What is full disk encryption?,"Full disk encryption involves encrypting the entire disk with a key that is stored within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This makes it very difficult for attackers to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, TPM can provide platform authentication before the data is encrypted."
How does Windows BitLocker use TPM for full disk encryption?,"Windows BitLocker utilizes TPM for full disk encryption by first encrypting the disk data with an encryption key called FVEK. This FVEK is then further encrypted using the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is stored within the TPM. When decrypting the data, BitLocker first prompts the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Subsequently, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once the FVEK is decrypted, BitLocker can then use it to decrypt the actual disk data. This process ensures that the data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the correct software launched."
What is the role of TPM in Windows BitLocker's data decryption process?,"In Windows BitLocker's data decryption process, the TPM plays a crucial role. First, it verifies the platform's integrity. Then, it is asked to decrypt the FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key) using the SRK (Storage Root Key). After the TPM successfully decrypts the FVEK, BitLocker can then use this FVEK to decrypt the actual disk data. This ensures that decryption is only possible on a trusted platform."
Define FVEK and SRK in the context of Windows BitLocker.,"FVEK stands for Full Volume Encryption Key. It is the encryption key used to encrypt the disk data in Windows BitLocker. SRK stands for Storage Root Key. In the context of BitLocker, the FVEK is further encrypted by the SRK, which is securely stored within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)."
What is the purpose of the Storage Root Key (SRK) in Windows BitLocker?,"The Storage Root Key (SRK) in Windows BitLocker is used to further encrypt the Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK). The SRK is securely stored within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), providing an additional layer of security for the encryption keys used to protect the disk data."
Explain the integrity measurement architecture of TPM.,"The integrity measurement architecture of TPM involves the TPM measuring hash values of each loaded software component. These hash values are stored in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) within the TPM. Because these PCRs are part of the TPM, they cannot be compromised by the operating system (OS) or any applications, ensuring the integrity of the measurements."
What are Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) in TPM?,"Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are components within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) where the TPM stores the hash values of loaded software. These hash values serve as an integrity report. The PCRs are designed to be tamper-resistant, meaning they cannot be compromised by the operating system or applications, thus ensuring the integrity of the measured software."
Describe the remote attestation protocol involving TPM.,"In the remote attestation protocol, the TPM first generates an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to a client. A trusted third party, known as a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), is involved to verify that the AIK indeed originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to confirm the authenticity of the received hash values. By examining these hash values, the client can determine if the loaded software is legitimate and correct."
What is an Attestation Identity Key (AIK)?,An Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is a key generated by the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specifically for the purpose of signing hash values during the remote attestation protocol. This AIK is used to prove the identity and integrity of the platform to a client.
What is the role of the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) in remote attestation?,The Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) is a trusted third party that plays a role in the remote attestation protocol. Its function is to verify that the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) being presented by a platform is genuinely from that correct platform. This verification step adds a layer of trust to the attestation process.
How does a client verify the authenticity of hash values during remote attestation?,"During remote attestation, a client verifies the authenticity of hash values by using the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) that was sent along with the hash values. The AIK, generated by the TPM and verified by a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), allows the client to confirm that the hash values are legitimate and originate from the expected platform."
What are the main categories of Protection Strategies mentioned?,"The main categories of Protection Strategies mentioned are Confinement, Reference Monitor, Hardware-assisted Protection, and Trusted Execution Environment."

As described in the document, it can be used for full disk encryption by securely storing encryption keys and performing platform authentication. It also plays a role in integrity measurement and remote attestation."
What is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)?,"A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area within a processor that is isolated from the main operating system (OS) and other applications. It is designed to protect applications' code and data from untrusted privileged software, such as a compromised OS or hypervisor. The OS or hypervisor can support the execution of applications within a TEE, but they cannot access the data processed inside it."
How does a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) protect applications?,"A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) protects applications by providing new hardware that isolates them from an untrusted OS or hypervisor. Within the TEE, the OS or hypervisor can execute applications, but they are prevented from accessing the sensitive data that the applications are processing. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of application data even if the underlying system software is compromised."
What is the limitation of Chains of Trust regarding runtime security?,"Chains of Trust can guarantee the integrity of secure booting, ensuring that the system starts up with verified software. However, they do not guarantee runtime security. This means that even if the privileged software, such as the OS or hypervisor, is booted with integrity verification, it can still be compromised while the system is running."
What is Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)?,"Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a security technology developed by Intel that safeguards an application's data and code. It allows for the creation of isolated and protected regions within memory, known as enclaves, where sensitive data and code can be processed securely. SGX was introduced in research papers in 2013 and officially launched with Intel's Skylake processor family in 2015."
What is an enclave in the context of Intel SGX?,"An enclave, in the context of Intel SGX, is an isolated and protected region of memory created for the code and data of an application. Data within an enclave is encrypted by the processor when stored in memory. Only the processor itself can access this data, and any attempts by other applications or the operating system to access it are forbidden and will result in an exception."
How is data protected within an Intel SGX enclave?,"Data within an Intel SGX enclave is protected through encryption. When data resides in the enclave and is stored in memory, the processor encrypts it. This encrypted data can only be accessed and decrypted by the processor itself. Any other entity, including other applications or the operating system, is prevented from accessing this data and will trigger an exception if they attempt to do so."
Describe the lifecycle of an application execution within an enclave.,"The lifecycle of an application execution within an enclave involves several steps. First, an application is divided into a trusted part and an untrusted part. The untrusted part then creates an enclave and places the trusted part inside it. When the trusted code requires execution, the processor enters the enclave. Inside the enclave, only trusted code can be executed and access the data. Once the execution is complete, the processor exits the enclave, and the untrusted part continues its execution."
What happens when trusted code needs execution in an enclave?,"When trusted code within an application needs to be executed, the processor enters the enclave. The enclave is a secure, isolated region of memory where only trusted code can run and access data. After the trusted code has finished its execution, the processor exits the enclave."
What is the role of the processor in managing enclaves?,"The processor plays a central role in managing enclaves. It is responsible for creating the enclave, entering it when trusted code needs execution, executing the trusted code and accessing its data within the enclave, and exiting the enclave once the execution is complete. The processor also handles the encryption and decryption of data within the enclave."
What is the difference between the trusted and untrusted parts of an application in an enclave?,"In an enclave environment, an application is divided into a trusted part and an untrusted part. The untrusted part is the portion of the application that interacts with the operating system and other external components. The trusted part is the sensitive code and data that needs to be protected. The untrusted part is responsible for creating the enclave and placing the trusted part within it, while the processor executes the trusted code inside the secure enclave."
What is attestation with SGX?,"Attestation with SGX refers to the services provided by Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to verify the integrity and authenticity of enclaves. This includes an integrity measurement architecture that measures the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and page locations within an enclave. It also involves an attestation protocol that uses an attestation key and cryptographic protocols to establish trust."
What does the integrity measurement architecture of SGX measure?,"The integrity measurement architecture of SGX measures various aspects of an enclave to ensure its integrity. This includes the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and the location of each page within the enclave. These measurements are used to create a report that can be attested to."
What is remote attestation in the context of SGX?,"In the context of SGX, remote attestation is a process where a remote client verifies the integrity of the code running within an enclave. This allows the client to be confident that the enclave is running the expected code and has not been tampered with."
What is local attestation in SGX?,"Local attestation in SGX occurs when multiple enclaves collaborate on the same task and exchange data at runtime. In such scenarios, these collaborating enclaves must prove to each other that they are trusted. This ensures that the data exchanged between enclaves is handled securely and by verified entities."
How do collaborating enclaves prove their trustworthiness?,"Collaborating enclaves prove their trustworthiness to each other through a process of local attestation. This involves each enclave demonstrating its integrity and authenticity to the other enclaves it is interacting with, ensuring that data exchange occurs only between trusted entities."

It achieves this through various encryption and integrity protection mechanisms applied to the VM's memory, registers, and data."
What are the key components involved in the integrity measurement architecture of TPM?,"The key components involved in the integrity measurement architecture of TPM are the TPM itself, which measures hash values, and the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs), which store these hash values. The measurements represent an integrity report of loaded software."
How does TPM ensure that the integrity measurements are not compromised?,TPM ensures that integrity measurements are not compromised because the hash values are stored in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) within the TPM itself. This hardware-based storage prevents the operating system or any applications from altering or tampering with these critical integrity reports.
What is the function of the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) in the remote attestation protocol?,"The Attestation Identity Key (AIK) in the remote attestation protocol is generated by the TPM to sign the hash values of the loaded software. This signed data is then sent to the client. The AIK acts as a credential that, when verified by a trusted third party like a PCA, confirms that the attestation originates from a legitimate platform."
What is the purpose of encrypting FVEK with SRK in Windows BitLocker?,"The purpose of encrypting FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key) with SRK (Storage Root Key) in Windows BitLocker is to add an extra layer of security. The SRK is securely stored within the TPM, and encrypting the FVEK with it means that the primary encryption key for the disk data is itself protected by a hardware-bound key, making it much harder for attackers to access."
How does TPM contribute to platform authentication before data encryption?,"TPM can provide platform authentication before data encryption by verifying the integrity and identity of the platform. This ensures that the encryption process is initiated only on a trusted and legitimate system, adding a security check before sensitive data is encrypted."
"What is the relationship between FVEK, SRK, and TPM in BitLocker?","In BitLocker, disk data is encrypted with FVEK. The FVEK itself is then encrypted with SRK. The SRK is securely stored within the TPM. This hierarchical protection ensures that the encryption keys are managed securely, with the ultimate key (SRK) residing in the tamper-resistant TPM."
What is the significance of the processor accessing data within an enclave?,"The significance of the processor accessing data within an enclave is that it is the *only* entity that can do so. Data inside an enclave is encrypted when stored in memory, and only the processor has the capability to decrypt and access it. This ensures that even if the memory is compromised, the data remains protected from unauthorized access by other software."
What happens if other apps or the OS try to access data in an enclave?,"If other applications or the operating system attempt to access data within an enclave, their actions are forbidden. This will result in an exception being invoked, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining the security of the enclave's contents."
What is the role of the 'Call Gate' in application execution within an enclave?,"The 'Call Gate' is a mechanism used in application execution within an enclave. It serves as the interface between the untrusted part of the application and the trusted part residing within the enclave. When the untrusted part needs to execute trusted code, it calls through the 'Call Gate' to enter the enclave."
What is the 'Return' action in the lifecycle of an application in an enclave?,"The 'Return' action, typically step 5 in the lifecycle of an application in an enclave, signifies the completion of the trusted code's execution within the enclave. After the trusted code finishes, the processor exits the enclave, and control is returned to the untrusted part of the application."
What is the purpose of the 'Process Secrets' component in the diagram of application execution in an enclave?,"The 'Process Secrets' component, shown within the 'Trusted Part of App' in the diagram, represents the sensitive data or operations that are handled securely within the enclave. These are the 'secrets' that the trusted code is designed to process, protected from the untrusted environment."
