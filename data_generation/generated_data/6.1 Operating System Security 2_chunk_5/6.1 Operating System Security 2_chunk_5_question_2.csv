What is full disk encryption and how does it work with TPM?,"Full disk encryption involves encrypting the entire disk's data using a key stored within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This makes it extremely difficult for attackers to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, the TPM can provide platform authentication before the data encryption process begins."
Explain the application of TPM in Windows BitLocker for full disk encryption.,"In Windows BitLocker, disk data is encrypted using an encryption key called FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key). This FVEK is then further encrypted and stored within the TPM using the Storage Root Key (SRK). When decrypting the data, BitLocker first prompts the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Subsequently, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once the FVEK is decrypted, BitLocker can use it to decrypt the actual disk data. This process ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the correct software launched."
What is the role of TPM in the integrity measurement architecture for remote attestation?,"In the integrity measurement architecture, the TPM measures hash values of each loaded software component. These hash values, which serve as an integrity report, are stored in Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within the TPM. This storage mechanism prevents the hash values from being compromised by the operating system (OS) or any applications."
Describe the remote attestation protocol involving TPM and AIK.,"The remote attestation protocol begins with the TPM generating an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). This AIK is used to sign the hash values of the loaded software. The signed hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to a client. A trusted third party, known as a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), is involved to verify that the AIK originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to confirm the authenticity of the received hash values. By examining these hash values, the client can determine if the loaded software is legitimate and has not been tampered with."
What are the main components of a protection strategy mentioned in the document?,"The document outlines protection strategies that include Confinement and Reference Monitor. It also highlights Hardware-assisted Protection, which encompasses Basic Functionalities, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)."
What is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and how does it protect applications?,"A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a hardware-based solution designed to protect applications from an untrusted operating system (OS) or hypervisor. While the OS or hypervisor can support the execution of applications within a TEE, they are prevented from accessing the application's data. This provides a secure environment for sensitive operations."
What is Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)?,"Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a security technology developed by Intel that safeguards an application's data and code. It was first introduced in research papers in 2013 and officially launched with Intel's Skylake processor family in 2015. SGX capabilities were enhanced between 2016 and 2019, expanding memory enclave sizes and improving security. In 2021, SGX support was removed from consumer desktops but remained available in servers."
Define 'enclave' in the context of Intel SGX.,"In the context of Intel SGX, an enclave is an isolated and protected region within the system's memory designated for the code and data of an application. Data stored within an enclave is encrypted by the processor when it resides in memory. Only the processor itself can access this data; any attempts by other applications or the operating system (OS) to access it are forbidden and will result in an exception."
Describe the lifecycle of an application running within an enclave.,"The lifecycle of an application within an enclave involves several steps. First, the application is divided into a trusted part and an untrusted part. The untrusted part then creates an enclave and places the trusted part inside it. When the trusted code requires execution, the processor enters the enclave. Within the enclave, only trusted code can be executed and access the data. Once the execution is complete, the processor exits the enclave, and the untrusted part resumes its execution."
What are the two main services SGX provides for attestation?,"SGX provides two primary services for attestation: integrity measurement architecture and attestation protocol. The integrity measurement architecture involves measuring the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and location of each page within an enclave. The attestation protocol utilizes an attestation key and a cryptographic protocol to verify the integrity and authenticity of the enclave."
Explain the concept of remote attestation within SGX.,Remote attestation within SGX allows a remote client to verify the integrity of the code and data residing within an enclave. This process ensures that the enclave has not been tampered with and is running the expected software.
What is local attestation in SGX and when is it used?,"Local attestation in SGX is used in scenarios where multiple enclaves collaborate on the same task and exchange data at runtime. In such cases, these collaborating enclaves must prove to each other that they are trusted. This ensures secure data exchange and coordinated execution among different enclaves."
What is AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)?,"AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a hardware extension designed to protect virtual machines (VMs) from an untrusted hypervisor. It offers several features: SEV (released in 2016) provides basic memory encryption for VMs. SEV-ES (Encrypted State, released in 2018) encrypts CPU registers. SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging, released in 2020) adds integrity protection."
Describe the mechanism of AMD SEV for protecting VMs.,"The mechanism of AMD SEV involves the processor encrypting the data, including memory pages, registers, and configurations, of guest virtual machines (VMs).

What happened to Intel SGX support in consumer desktops in 2021?,"In 2021, Intel SGX support was removed from consumer desktop processors. However, it was retained for server processors."
What does it mean for data to be 'encrypted by the processor' within an SGX enclave?,"When data within an SGX enclave is 'encrypted by the processor,' it means that the processor itself performs the encryption. This encryption is applied when the data is stored in the system's main memory. This ensures that even if the memory is accessed by unauthorized entities, the data remains unintelligible."
What happens if other apps or the OS attempt to access data within an SGX enclave?,"If any other applications or the operating system (OS) attempt to access data within an SGX enclave, these attempts are forbidden. Such unauthorized access attempts will trigger an exception, halting the operation and potentially signaling a security breach."
How is an application divided for execution within an enclave?,"For execution within an enclave, an application is divided into two parts: a trusted part and an untrusted part. The untrusted part handles the general execution flow and interacts with the system, while the trusted part contains the sensitive code and data that require protection within the enclave."
What is the function of the 'Call Gate' in enclave execution?,"The 'Call Gate' is a mechanism used in enclave execution to transition control from the untrusted part of an application to the trusted part within the enclave. It acts as a secure entry point, ensuring that the transition is properly managed and authorized."
What happens after the trusted code completes its execution in an enclave?,"After the trusted code has completed its execution within the enclave, the processor exits the enclave. Control is then returned to the untrusted part of the application, which continues its execution, potentially using the results or data processed by the trusted part."
What is the role of 'Privileged System Code' in relation to enclave execution?,"Privileged System Code, which includes the OS, VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor), BIOS, and SMM (System Management Mode), interacts with the enclave execution process. While the untrusted part of the application interacts with this privileged code, the enclave itself provides a protected environment that these system components cannot directly access or compromise."
What is the 'integrity measurement architecture' for SGX attestation?,"The integrity measurement architecture for SGX attestation involves measuring various components of an enclave, including its code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and the location of each page. These measurements create a unique fingerprint of the enclave's state, which is used for verification."
What is the 'attestation protocol' in SGX?,The attestation protocol in SGX refers to the cryptographic procedures and the use of an attestation key that allow an enclave to prove its integrity and authenticity to a relying party. This protocol ensures that the enclave is genuine and has not been tampered with.
What is the purpose of local attestation between collaborating enclaves?,"The purpose of local attestation between collaborating enclaves is to establish trust between them. When enclaves work together and exchange data at runtime, they need to prove to each other that they are secure and have not been compromised, ensuring the integrity of their joint operation."

SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging, released 2020) enhances security by providing integrity protection."
How does AMD SEV prevent the hypervisor from accessing VM data?,"AMD SEV prevents the hypervisor from accessing VM data by encrypting the data (memory pages, registers, configurations) of the guest VMs. This encryption is handled by the processor, rendering the data unreadable to the hypervisor even if it attempts to access it."
What component manages encryption keys in AMD SEV?,An AMD Secure Processor is utilized within the AMD SEV framework to manage the encryption keys. This dedicated secure processor ensures that the keys used for encrypting VM data are handled securely.
What is meant by 'transparent encryption' in AMD SEV?,"'Transparent encryption' in AMD SEV signifies that the encryption and decryption processes occur without requiring significant modifications to the virtual machine's software or configuration. The VM operates as if it were running without encryption, simplifying its integration and management."
What is the main benefit of using TPM for data encryption?,"The main benefit of using TPM for data encryption is the enhanced security it provides for the encryption key. The key is stored within the TPM and never leaves it, making it extremely difficult for attackers to steal or compromise, thereby protecting the encrypted data."
How does Windows BitLocker ensure that data is only decrypted on the correct platform?,Windows BitLocker ensures that data is only decrypted on the correct platform through a process involving the TPM. It requires the TPM to verify the platform's integrity and then decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. This multi-step verification tied to the specific hardware platform prevents unauthorized decryption.
What is the purpose of measuring hash values of loaded software by TPM?,"The purpose of measuring hash values of loaded software by the TPM is to create an integrity report. This report allows for verification that the software loaded onto the system has not been tampered with or altered, ensuring the system's trustworthiness."
