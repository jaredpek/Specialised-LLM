What is Remote Attestation?,Remote Attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. This is achieved by a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. A common strategy involves proving that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What are the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the Integrity measurement architecture and the Remote attestation protocol. The Integrity measurement architecture provides a reliable and trustworthy security report. The Remote attestation protocol ensures that the attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers in the OS, apps, or network."
Explain the Integrity Measurement Architecture in the context of remote attestation.,"The Integrity measurement architecture is a key component for remote attestation. It involves the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measuring hash values of each loaded software component, which serves as an integrity report. These hash values are then stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within the TPM, making them resistant to compromise by the operating system (OS) or applications."
Describe the Remote Attestation Protocol.,"The Remote Attestation Protocol is crucial for ensuring the secure transmission of attestation reports. In this protocol, the TPM generates an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These hash values, along with the AIK, are sent to the client. A trusted third party, known as a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), is involved to verify that the AIK originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to authenticate the received hash values, thereby determining if the loaded software is correct."
What is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip integrated into a platform. It functions as a separated co-processor, and its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software. The TPM contains components like random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and different types of crypto keys."
What are the key features inside a TPM chip?,"Inside a TPM chip, there are several key features. These include random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and various types of crypto keys. The chip also houses persistent memory, which stores elements like the Endorsement Key (EK) and the Storage Root Key (SRK), and versatile memory, which contains Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK), along with storage keys."
How is a TPM designed and when were its versions released?,"TPMs are designed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). The first version, TPM 1.1b, was released in 2003. An improved version, TPM 1.2, was developed around 2005-2009 and became equipped in PCs in 2006 and servers in 2008, later being standardized by ISO and IEC in 2009. An upgraded version, TPM 2.0, was released on April 9, 2014."
What are some applications of TPM?,"TPMs have several applications, including Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and Microsoft Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB). Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 as a minimal system requirement. The Linux kernel began supporting TPM 2.0 with version 3.20. Google incorporates TPMs into Chromebooks as part of their security model, and virtualization platforms like VMware, Xen, and KVM all support virtualized TPMs."
What is a Chain of Trust in the context of TPM?,"A Chain of Trust, when built with TPM, is a hierarchical system that establishes verified systems from the bottom up. In this layered system, lower layers possess higher privileges and can protect higher layers. Each layer is vulnerable to attacks from below if not secured appropriately. The TPM acts as the root of trust, initiating a secure boot process that continues until the OS is fully booted and applications are running. The bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer, and launching the top layer is only permitted after successful verification."
What are potential applications of building a Chain of Trust with TPM?,"Potential applications of building a Chain of Trust with TPM include digital rights management, enforcement of software licenses (e.g., for Microsoft Office and Outlook), and prevention of cheating in online games."
Describe the process of Integrity Verification.,"Integrity Verification ensures that only layers passing verification are launched. The process involves loading code from memory, computing its hash value, and verifying its signature. If the hash value matches the signature and is valid, the code is launched. Otherwise, the boot process is aborted. This verification step uses a public key and a certificate authority to validate the signature of the program binary."
How does Data Encryption with TPM work for full disk encryption?,"For full disk encryption, data is encrypted using a key stored within the TPM. This makes it extremely difficult for attackers to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, the TPM can provide platform authentication before the data encryption process begins."
Explain how Windows BitLocker uses TPM for data encryption.,"In Windows BitLocker, disk data is encrypted with an encryption key called FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key). This FVEK is then further encrypted by the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is securely stored in the TPM. When decrypting data, BitLocker first prompts the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Subsequently, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once the FVEK is decrypted, BitLocker can use it to decrypt the actual data. This process ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the appropriate software launched."
What is the role of the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) in TPM?,"Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within a TPM are used to store hash values of loaded software. These hash values serve as an integrity report and are stored in the PCRs, which are protected from being compromised by the operating system or applications. This makes them a secure place to record the state of the system's software."
What is an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) and its function in TPM?,"An Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is generated by the TPM and is used to sign the hash values of loaded software. These signed hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to a client as part of the remote attestation process. The AIK acts as a credential, allowing the client to verify the authenticity of the reported software integrity."
How is the authenticity of an AIK verified?,"The authenticity of an AIK is verified by a trusted third party, specifically a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA). The PCA is called upon to confirm that the AIK indeed originates from the correct and trusted platform. This verification step is crucial for establishing trust in the remote attestation process."
What is the purpose of the Endorsement Key (EK) in a TPM?,"The Endorsement Key (EK) is a unique key stored in the TPM's persistent memory. It is typically provisioned by the TPM manufacturer and serves as a root of trust for the TPM itself. The EK can be used to authenticate the TPM and, by extension, the platform it resides on."
What is the Storage Root Key (SRK) in a TPM?,"The Storage Root Key (SRK) is another key stored in the TPM's persistent memory. It acts as a master key for encrypting and protecting other keys and sensitive data stored within the TPM or associated with the platform. In applications like BitLocker, the SRK is used to encrypt the FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key)."
What are the different types of memory found within a TPM?,"A TPM contains two main types of memory: Persistent memory and Versatile memory. Persistent memory stores critical keys and identifiers such as the Endorsement Key (EK) and the Storage Root Key (SRK). Versatile memory includes components like Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK), as well as general storage keys."
What is the function of the cryptographic processor within a TPM?,"The cryptographic processor within a TPM is responsible for performing various cryptographic operations. This includes generating random numbers, generating cryptographic keys, performing hashing operations (like SHA-1), and executing encryption and decryption algorithms for signing and verifying data."
How does a TPM ensure its state is not compromised?,"A TPM is designed as a separated co-processor, and its state is protected from being compromised by malicious host system software. This isolation is achieved through its hardware design and the secure execution environment it provides, preventing unauthorized access or modification of its internal data and operations."
What is the basic functionality of Remote Attestation?,"The basic functionality of Remote Attestation is to provide a mechanism for a user to confirm that their application is running securely on a trusted platform. It achieves this by enabling a remote platform to present unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client, thereby proving that the software is intact and trustworthy."
What does it mean for a platform to be 'trusted' in the context of Remote Attestation?,"In the context of Remote Attestation, a 'trusted' platform refers to a system whose integrity and security can be reliably verified. This trust is established through mechanisms like the TPM, which provides unforgeable evidence about the software running on the platform, ensuring it is intact and has not been tampered with."
How does a remote platform provide evidence of its security?,"A remote platform provides evidence of its security by generating unforgeable reports about the state of its software. This is typically done through the TPM, which measures the integrity of loaded software components and uses cryptographic methods to sign this information. This signed evidence is then presented to a client for verification."
What is the role of a client in Remote Attestation?,"In Remote Attestation, the client is the entity that requests proof of trustworthiness from a remote platform. The client receives the security report (including signed hash values and an AIK) from the platform and uses cryptographic means, often involving a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), to verify the authenticity and integrity of the reported software."
Can you explain the concept of 'unforgeable evidence' in Remote Attestation?,"'Unforgeable evidence' in Remote Attestation refers to security reports generated by the platform that cannot be falsified or altered by an attacker. This is achieved through cryptographic techniques, such as digital signatures created by the TPM using its private keys, which can only be verified with the corresponding public key."
What is the relationship between the OS kernel and Remote Attestation?,"The OS kernel is a critical component of the platform whose integrity is assessed during Remote Attestation. The TPM measures the hash values of the OS kernel and other software components. The integrity of the OS kernel is fundamental to the overall security of the platform, and its state is reported to the client as part of the attestation process."
What are the components of a typical platform that are relevant to Remote Attestation?,"A typical platform relevant to Remote Attestation includes various components such as the CPU, Memory, Network Interface Card (NIC), and Disk. The OS kernel manages these components, and the TPM assesses the integrity of the software running on them, including the OS and applications."
What is the purpose of the 'Prove to me about your trustworthiness' request?,"The 'Prove to me about your trustworthiness' request is an instruction from a client to a remote platform, initiating the Remote Attestation process. It signifies the client's desire to verify the security and integrity of the software executing on the remote platform before engaging with it."
What information is included in the 'security report for your app'?,"The 'security report for your app' typically contains evidence of the software's integrity, such as hash values of the application code and its dependencies. This report is cryptographically signed by the TPM and may include an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) for verification purposes, allowing the client to confirm that the application is running as expected on a trusted platform."
What is the role of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)?,"The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) is the organization responsible for designing and developing specifications for Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and related technologies. They define the standards and architecture for TPMs, ensuring interoperability and security across different platforms."
What is the significance of TPM 2.0?,"TPM 2.0 is an upgraded version of the Trusted Platform Module that offers enhanced security features and greater flexibility compared to its predecessors. It was released on April 9, 2014, and is increasingly becoming a standard requirement for modern operating systems and applications, such as Windows 11."
How does TPM contribute to establishing a 'root of trust'?,"TPM establishes a 'root of trust' by being the initial secure component that is initialized during the system's boot process. It securely measures and records the integrity of subsequent software components, including the BIOS, firmware, and operating system. This chain of measurements, anchored by the TPM, ensures that the entire system boot process is trustworthy."
What is the 'root of trust' in the context of TPM?,"The 'root of trust' in the context of TPM refers to the foundational element of security within a system. The TPM serves as this root, providing a secure and tamper-resistant foundation upon which the integrity of the entire system, from boot-up to application execution, can be verified."
How does TPM help in securing the boot process?,"TPM secures the boot process by acting as the root of trust. It measures the integrity of each component as it loads during startup, starting from the firmware. These measurements are stored in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). The system can then verify these measurements to ensure that no unauthorized modifications have occurred during the boot sequence."
What is the relationship between lower and higher layers in a layered system secured by TPM?,"In a layered system secured by TPM, lower layers have higher privileges and are responsible for protecting the higher layers. Each layer's integrity is validated by the layer below it. This hierarchical validation ensures that if a lower layer is compromised, it cannot be used to attack or compromise the layers above it."
What is the vulnerability of each layer in a layered system?,"In a layered system, each layer is vulnerable to attacks originating from the layer below it. If the lower layer is not adequately secured, an attacker could exploit it to compromise the integrity and security of the layer above it. This highlights the importance of securing each layer in the chain of trust."
What is the purpose of validating the integrity of the top layer by the bottom layer?,"Validating the integrity of the top layer by the bottom layer is a crucial step in establishing a secure chain of trust. It ensures that the components at the highest level of the system are functioning as intended and have not been tampered with. This verification allows the system to proceed safely, knowing that the entire stack is secure."
When is it safe to launch the top layer of a system?,"It is safe to launch the top layer of a system only when the integrity verification process has passed successfully. This means that all underlying layers, including the operating system and applications, have been validated and confirmed to be secure and untampered."
What is the role of hash values in Integrity Verification?,"Hash values are fundamental to Integrity Verification. A hash value is a unique digital fingerprint of a piece of data (like program code). By computing the hash value of the loaded code and comparing it to a known, trusted hash value (often derived from a verified signature), one can determine if the code has been altered."
How is a signature used in Integrity Verification?,"A signature, typically a digital signature, is used in conjunction with a hash value during Integrity Verification. The signature is created using the private key of the software publisher and is based on the hash of the program binary. The client can then use the corresponding public key to verify the signature. If the signature is valid and matches the computed hash of the binary, it confirms the authenticity and integrity of the software."
What happens if the hash value and signature do not match during verification?,"If the hash value and signature do not match during the Integrity Verification process, it indicates that the program binary has been modified or is not authentic. In such a scenario, the system will flag an error and refuse to execute the code, thereby preventing potentially malicious software from running."
What is the function of a Certificate Authority (CA) in Integrity Verification?,"A Certificate Authority (CA) plays a role in verifying the authenticity of the public key used to check the digital signature during Integrity Verification. The CA issues digital certificates that bind a public key to an identity. By trusting the CA, the system can trust the public key it provides, which is essential for validating the signature on the program binary."
What is the benefit of encrypting data with a key in TPM?,"Encrypting data with a key that resides within the TPM offers a significant security benefit: it makes it extremely difficult for attackers to steal the encryption key. Since the key never leaves the secure environment of the TPM, it is protected from software-based attacks and physical extraction attempts."
How does TPM provide platform authentication before data encryption?,"TPM can provide platform authentication before data encryption by verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of the platform itself. This ensures that the encryption process is initiated only on a legitimate and secure system, adding an extra layer of security before sensitive data is encrypted."
What is FVEK in the context of Windows BitLocker?,"FVEK stands for Full Volume Encryption Key. In Windows BitLocker, the FVEK is the primary encryption key used to encrypt the actual disk data. This FVEK is itself encrypted by the Storage Root Key (SRK) which is stored within the TPM, providing a secure way to manage the encryption key."
How does BitLocker use SRK to decrypt FVEK?,"When decrypting data with BitLocker, the system first requests the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Once verified, BitLocker asks the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. The SRK, being a key stored securely within the TPM, is used to unlock and reveal the FVEK, which can then be used to decrypt the actual disk data."
What ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with BitLocker and TPM?,"The combination of BitLocker and TPM ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the correct software launched. This is achieved because the decryption process relies on the TPM to verify platform integrity and to decrypt the necessary encryption keys (like FVEK using SRK). If the platform or software is not as expected, the TPM will not perform the decryption, thus protecting the data."
