Analyse the basic functionality of Remote Attestation with respect to its purpose.,Remote Attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify whether their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. It achieves this by enabling a remote platform to provide unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. This is a common strategy to prove that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What insights can you derive from the analysis of the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the Integrity measurement architecture and the Remote attestation protocol. The Integrity measurement architecture is responsible for providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. The Remote attestation protocol ensures that this attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers, whether they target the OS, apps, or the network."
Explain the concept of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as a chip integrated into the platform.,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip that is integrated into the platform. It functions as a separated co-processor, and its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software. This isolation ensures the integrity and security of the operations it performs."
Describe the internal components of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip.,"Inside a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip, there are several key components. These include random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and support for different types of crypto keys. The chip also contains persistent memory, which stores elements like the Endorsement Key (EK) and the Storage Root Key (SRK), and versatile memory, which holds Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK)."
What are the different types of crypto keys found within a TPM?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip supports different types of crypto keys. These include the Endorsement Key (EK), which is stored in persistent memory and is unique to the TPM, and the Storage Root Key (SRK), also in persistent memory, used for encrypting other keys. Additionally, Attestation Identity Keys (AIK) are stored in versatile memory and are used for signing attestation reports."
Detail the development history of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG).,"The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) was designed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). The first version, TPM 1.1b, was released in 2003. An improved version, TPM 1.2, was developed around 2005-2009 and became equipped in PCs in 2006 and servers in 2008. This version was standardized by ISO and IEC in 2009. An upgraded version, TPM 2.0, was subsequently released on 9 April 2014."
What are the key applications of TPM technology?,"The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) has several key applications. These include Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), Microsoft Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB), and it is a minimal system requirement for Windows 11. The Linux kernel started supporting TPM 2.0 from version 3.20. Google incorporates TPMs in Chromebooks as part of their security model, and virtualization platforms like VMware, Xen, and KVM all support virtualized TPM."
Explain the concept of a 'Chain of Trust' with respect to TPM.,"A 'Chain of Trust' establishes verified systems from bottom to top. In a hierarchical view, a computer system is a layered system where lower layers have higher privileges and can protect higher layers. Each layer is vulnerable to attacks from below if it is not secured appropriately. The TPM serves as the 'root of trust' by establishing a secure boot process, starting from the TPM itself and continuing until the OS has fully booted and applications are running. The bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer, and it is only safe to launch the top layer when the verification passes."
What are the potential applications of building a Chain of Trust with TPM?,"Potential applications of building a Chain of Trust with TPM include digital rights management, enforcement of software licenses (e.g., for Microsoft Office and Outlook), and prevention of cheating in online games. The layered structure, from Hardware to Firmware, VM, OS, Container, and Apps, benefits from this trust establishment."
Describe the process of Integrity Verification.,"Integrity Verification ensures that only the layer that passes the verification process is launched. The process involves loading the code from memory, computing its hash value, and verifying its signature. If the hash value matches the signature and is valid, the code is launched. Otherwise, the boot process is aborted."
How does the integrity verification process ensure the authenticity of software?,"Integrity Verification ensures software authenticity by comparing a computed hash value of the program binary with a verified signature. The process involves loading the program binary from memory, computing its hash value, and then verifying the signature associated with it. If the computed hash value matches the signature and is deemed valid, the software is considered authentic and can be launched. If there is a mismatch or the signature is invalid, an error is flagged, and execution is refused, aborting the boot process."
Explain the role of the Public Key and Certificate Authority in Integrity Verification.,"In the Integrity Verification process, the Public Key and the Certificate Authority play crucial roles. The Public Key is used in conjunction with the signature to verify the authenticity of the program binary. The Certificate Authority is a trusted entity that issues certificates, which can be used to validate the Public Key itself, thereby ensuring that the verification process is based on a trustworthy source."
"Describe the process of Data Encryption with TPM, specifically full disk encryption.","Full disk encryption using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) involves encrypting the data with a key stored within the TPM. This makes it difficult for attackers to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, the TPM can provide platform authentication before the data encryption process begins, ensuring that the platform itself is trusted."
How does Windows BitLocker utilize TPM for data encryption?,"Windows BitLocker utilizes TPM for data encryption by first encrypting disk data with an encryption key called FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key). This FVEK is then further encrypted with the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is securely stored within the TPM. When decrypting data, BitLocker first prompts the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Subsequently, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once decrypted, BitLocker can then use the FVEK to decrypt the actual data. This process ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the correct software launched."
What is the significance of the Storage Root Key (SRK) in the context of Windows BitLocker and TPM?,"The Storage Root Key (SRK) is a critical component in Windows BitLocker's data encryption process when using a TPM. The FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key), which encrypts the disk data, is itself encrypted by the SRK. The SRK is securely stored within the TPM and is used by the TPM to decrypt the FVEK when requested by BitLocker after platform integrity has been verified. This hierarchical encryption, with the SRK in the TPM, enhances security by protecting the primary encryption key."
Explain the process of Remote Attestation with TPM.,"Remote Attestation with TPM involves an Integrity measurement architecture and a Remote attestation protocol. The TPM measures hash values of each loaded software component, storing these hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) which are protected from OS or app compromise. For the protocol, the TPM generates an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign these hash values. The signed hash values are sent to a client. A trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), verifies that the AIK originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to verify the authenticity of the received hash values, thereby confirming the integrity of the loaded software."
What is the role of the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) in the Integrity measurement architecture of TPM?,"Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are integral to the Integrity measurement architecture of a TPM.

The AIK serves as a unique identifier for the platform and is used by the client, after verification by a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), to confirm that the received hash values are authentic and originate from the correct, trusted platform."
How does a client verify the authenticity of received hash values during Remote Attestation using AIK?,"During Remote Attestation, a client verifies the authenticity of received hash values by using the Attestation Identity Key (AIK). After the AIK has been verified by a trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), to ensure it originates from the correct platform, the client uses this AIK to cryptographically validate the signatures on the hash values. By successfully verifying these signatures, the client can confirm that the loaded software is indeed authentic and has not been tampered with."
What is the purpose of the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) in Remote Attestation with TPM?,"The Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) plays a crucial role in Remote Attestation with TPM by acting as a trusted third party. Its primary function is to verify that the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) used in the attestation process genuinely belongs to the correct and intended platform. This verification by the PCA lends credibility to the AIK and, by extension, to the integrity report signed by it, assuring the client of the platform's trustworthiness."
