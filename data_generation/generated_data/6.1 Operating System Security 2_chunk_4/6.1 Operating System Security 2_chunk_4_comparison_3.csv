What is the basic functionality of remote attestation?,Remote attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. This is achieved by a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. A common strategy involves proving that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What are the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the integrity measurement architecture and the remote attestation protocol. The integrity measurement architecture is responsible for providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. The remote attestation protocol ensures that this attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers on the OS, apps, or network."
Describe the integrity measurement architecture in the context of remote attestation.,"The integrity measurement architecture, in the context of remote attestation, involves the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measuring hash values of each loaded software component. These hash values serve as an integrity report and are stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within the TPM. This storage mechanism prevents compromise by the OS or any applications."
Explain the remote attestation protocol.,"The remote attestation protocol involves the TPM generating an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to the client. A trusted third party, known as a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), is involved to verify that the AIK originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to authenticate the received hash values. By examining these hash values, the client can determine if the loaded software is correct."
What is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip that is integrated into a platform. It functions as a separate co-processor, and its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software. Inside the TPM, there are random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and different types of crypto keys."
What are the key features of a TPM chip?,"A TPM chip is integrated into the platform and acts as a separate co-processor. Its state is protected from compromise by malicious host system software. Internally, it contains components such as random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and various types of cryptographic keys."
What functionalities are found inside a TPM chip?,"Inside a TPM chip, you can find random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and different types of cryptographic keys. These components enable the TPM to perform secure cryptographic operations."
What are the different types of memory and processors within a TPM?,"A TPM contains a cryptographic processor and persistent memory, as well as versatile memory. The cryptographic processor includes a random number generator, RSA key generator, SHA-1 hash generator, and an encryption-decryption-signature engine. The persistent memory holds the Endorsement Key (EK) and the Storage Root Key (SRK). The versatile memory contains Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK), along with storage keys."
Who designed the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) was designed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG).
What were the different versions of TPM and their release timelines?,"The first version of TPM, TPM 1.1b, was released in 2003. An improved version, TPM 1.2, was developed around 2005-2009 and was equipped in PCs in 2006 and servers in 2008. It was standardized by ISO and IEC in 2009. An upgraded version, TPM 2.0, was released on April 9, 2014."
What are some applications of TPM?,"TPM has several applications, including Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and Microsoft Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB). Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 as a minimal system requirement. The Linux kernel began supporting TPM 2.0 with version 3.20. Google incorporates TPMs in Chromebooks as part of their security model, and virtualization platforms like VMware, Xen, and KVM all support virtualized TPM."
How does a TPM contribute to building a chain of trust?,"A TPM helps build a chain of trust by establishing a secure boot process. It acts as the 'root of trust,' ensuring that the system boots securely from the TPM itself and continues this verification until the OS is fully booted and applications are running. In a hierarchical system, lower layers have higher privileges and protect higher layers. The TPM validates the integrity of the layers above it, and it is safe to launch a higher layer only after its verification passes."
What is a 'Chain of Trust' in the context of a computer system?,"A 'Chain of Trust' is a concept where verified systems are established from the bottom up. In a hierarchical computer system, lower layers possess higher privileges and can protect the layers above them. Each layer is susceptible to attacks from below if it is not adequately secured. The chain of trust ensures that each layer's integrity is validated before the next layer is launched."
What are some potential applications of TPM-based chain of trust?,"Potential applications of TPM-based chain of trust include digital rights management, enforcement of software licenses (e.g., for Microsoft Office and Outlook), and prevention of cheating in online games."
Describe the process of integrity verification.,"Integrity verification involves loading code from memory, computing its hash value, and verifying its signature. If the hash value matches the signature and is valid, the code is launched. Otherwise, the boot process is aborted. This process ensures that only layers that pass integrity verification are executed."
How does the integrity verification process work with a public key and certificate authority?,"During integrity verification, a program binary and its signature are processed. The hash of the binary is computed and verified against the signature using a public key. This public key is typically provided by a Certificate Authority. If the hash matches the signature and is deemed valid, execution continues. If not, an error is flagged, and execution is refused."
What is the role of the Certificate Authority in integrity verification?,The Certificate Authority (CA) plays a role in integrity verification by providing the public key that is used to verify the signature of a program binary. This ensures that the signature is authentic and can be trusted.
What happens if the hash value and signature do not match during integrity verification?,"If the hash value and signature do not match during integrity verification, an error is flagged, and the execution is refused. This indicates that the integrity of the code has been compromised."
Explain how TPM is used for full disk encryption.,"For full disk encryption using TPM, the data is encrypted with a key stored within the TPM. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, TPM can provide platform authentication before the data encryption process begins."
How does Windows BitLocker utilize TPM for data encryption?,"In Windows BitLocker, disk data is encrypted using an encryption key called FVEK. This FVEK is then further encrypted by the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is stored within the TPM. When decrypting data, BitLocker first prompts the TPM to verify platform integrity. Subsequently, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once decrypted, BitLocker can use the FVEK to decrypt the actual data. This ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the appropriate software launched."
What is FVEK in the context of Windows BitLocker and TPM?,"FVEK, in the context of Windows BitLocker and TPM, stands for Full Volume Encryption Key. It is the primary encryption key used to encrypt the disk data. This FVEK is itself encrypted by the Storage Root Key (SRK) which resides in the TPM, adding a layer of security."
What is SRK in relation to TPM and BitLocker?,"SRK stands for Storage Root Key. In the context of TPM and BitLocker, the SRK is a key stored within the TPM that is used to encrypt the Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK). This process enhances the security of the disk encryption by ensuring that the FVEK cannot be accessed without the TPM's involvement."
How does TPM ensure that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with BitLocker?,"TPM ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with BitLocker through a verification process. When decrypting data, BitLocker first asks the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Then, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Only after these steps are successfully completed can BitLocker use the FVEK to decrypt the data, thereby restricting decryption to the authorized platform and software."
Compare remote attestation with integrity verification.,"Remote attestation is a broader mechanism that allows a user to know if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. It involves providing unforgeable evidence about the software's security. Integrity verification is a component of this process, specifically focusing on loading code from memory, computing its hash value, verifying its signature, and then deciding whether to launch the code or abort the boot process based on the validity of the hash and signature."
What is the purpose of the Attestation Identity Key (AIK)?,"The Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is generated by the TPM to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These signed hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to the client as part of the remote attestation process. The AIK serves as an identity for the TPM, allowing the client to verify the authenticity of the attestation report."
How does a client verify the authenticity of a remote attestation report?,"A client verifies the authenticity of a remote attestation report by using the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) provided by the TPM. The client uses this AIK to authenticate the received hash values. Additionally, a trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), can be called upon to verify that the AIK itself originates from the correct platform, further strengthening the trust in the report."
What is the role of the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) in remote attestation?,The Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) is a trusted third party that is called upon to verify that the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) used in remote attestation indeed originates from the correct platform. This verification step adds an extra layer of assurance to the attestation process.
What information is sent from the TPM to the client during remote attestation?,"During remote attestation, the TPM sends the hash values of the loaded software, along with the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) that is used to sign these hash values, to the client."
How does a client determine if the loaded software is correct using remote attestation?,"A client determines if the loaded software is correct by checking the hash values provided in the remote attestation report. By comparing these hash values with expected values or by verifying their authenticity using the AIK, the client can ascertain the integrity of the software."
What is the difference between a TPM and a general cryptographic processor?,"A TPM is a specialized chip integrated into a platform that acts as a secure co-processor. While it contains a cryptographic processor, its primary function is to provide hardware-based security features like secure key storage, platform integrity measurement, and attestation. A general cryptographic processor might be a more versatile component focused on performing various cryptographic algorithms without the same level of integrated security and platform-specific functionalities as a TPM."
Explain the concept of 'unforgeable evidence' in remote attestation.,"Unforgeable evidence in remote attestation refers to the security information provided by the remote platform that cannot be tampered with or faked by an attacker. This evidence, typically in the form of signed hash values of the software, is generated and protected by the TPM, ensuring its integrity and authenticity."
What is the significance of the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) in a TPM?,"Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within a TPM are crucial for integrity measurement. They store the hash values of the loaded software components. Because these registers are part of the TPM and are protected from modification by the OS or applications, they provide a secure and tamper-evident record of the system's software state."
How does a TPM protect its state from malicious host system software?,"A TPM protects its state from malicious host system software by being a separate co-processor. This separation ensures that the TPM's internal operations and stored data are isolated from the main system's software, preventing unauthorized access or modification."
What is the purpose of the Endorsement Key (EK) in a TPM?,"The Endorsement Key (EK) is a unique, secret key stored in the TPM's persistent memory. It is typically provisioned by the TPM manufacturer and serves as a root of trust for the TPM itself. The EK can be used to prove the authenticity of the TPM and to establish trust in the platform."
What is the function of the Storage Root Key (SRK) in a TPM?,"The Storage Root Key (SRK) is another key stored in the TPM's persistent memory. It acts as a master key for encrypting and protecting other keys and sensitive data stored within the TPM or associated with the platform. In applications like BitLocker, the SRK is used to encrypt the FVEK."
Compare the roles of EK and SRK in a TPM.,"The Endorsement Key (EK) is primarily used for proving the authenticity of the TPM itself, acting as a root of trust for the TPM. The Storage Root Key (SRK), on the other hand, is used as a master key for encrypting and protecting other keys and data stored within or managed by the TPM, such as the FVEK in BitLocker."
What are Attestation Identity Keys (AIK) and how are they used?,"Attestation Identity Keys (AIK) are keys generated by the TPM that are used to sign attestation reports. They act as pseudonymous identities for the TPM, allowing it to prove the integrity of the software running on the platform without revealing the TPM's unique Endorsement Key (EK). The AIK is used by the client to verify the authenticity of the signed hash values."
What is the difference between AIK and EK?,"The Endorsement Key (EK) is a unique, permanent key tied to a specific TPM, used for proving the TPM's identity. Attestation Identity Keys (AIK) are temporary or pseudonymous keys generated by the TPM, used to sign attestation reports. AIKs allow for privacy by not directly exposing the EK during attestation, while still enabling verification of the platform's integrity."
How does a TPM facilitate secure boot?,"A TPM facilitates secure boot by acting as the root of trust. It measures the integrity of the boot process components, starting from the firmware and progressing through the OS loader and kernel. These measurements are stored in PCRs. The TPM ensures that the boot process continues only if these integrity measurements are valid, preventing the execution of unauthorized or tampered software."
What is the purpose of 'Hardware-assisted Protection' mentioned in the outline?,"'Hardware-assisted Protection' refers to security mechanisms that leverage specialized hardware features to enhance system security. Examples include basic functionalities provided by hardware, Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which offer robust security guarantees that are difficult to achieve with software alone."
What are 'Protection Strategies' in the context of system security?,"'Protection Strategies' are methods and techniques employed to safeguard a system from threats. The document mentions 'Confinement' and 'Reference Monitor' as examples of such strategies, which aim to isolate processes or enforce access control policies to maintain system security."
What is a 'Reference Monitor' in system security?,"A 'Reference Monitor' is a conceptual security mechanism that controls all access between subjects (e.g., users, processes) and objects (e.g., files, memory). It enforces security policies and ensures that access is granted only when permitted. While conceptual, its principles are implemented in various security enforcement mechanisms."
What does 'Confinement' mean as a protection strategy?,'Confinement' as a protection strategy involves isolating a process or a piece of code to limit its potential impact if compromised. This means restricting its access to system resources and preventing it from interfering with other parts of the system.
How does a TPM ensure that its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software?,"A TPM ensures its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software because it is a separate co-processor. This physical and logical separation prevents the host system's software, even if compromised, from directly accessing or altering the TPM's internal registers, memory, and cryptographic keys."
What is the relationship between TPM and Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)?,"Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) is one of the applications that utilizes TPM. TXT leverages the security capabilities of a TPM to establish a trusted execution environment, enhancing the security of sensitive operations."
