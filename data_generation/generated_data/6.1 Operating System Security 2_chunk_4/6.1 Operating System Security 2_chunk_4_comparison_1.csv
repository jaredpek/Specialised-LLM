What is the basic functionality of remote attestation?,Remote attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. This is achieved by a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. A common strategy involves proving that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What are the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the integrity measurement architecture and the remote attestation protocol. The integrity measurement architecture is responsible for providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. The remote attestation protocol ensures that this attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers across the OS, applications, or network."
Compare the integrity measurement architecture with the remote attestation protocol.,"The integrity measurement architecture focuses on generating a reliable and trustworthy security report by measuring the integrity of loaded software. In contrast, the remote attestation protocol focuses on the secure transmission of this report, ensuring it is not tampered with by attackers across the OS, applications, or network. The integrity measurement architecture provides the data, while the remote attestation protocol secures its delivery and verification."
Describe the role of the integrity measurement architecture in remote attestation.,"The integrity measurement architecture plays a crucial role in remote attestation by providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. It measures the hash values of each loaded software component, which serves as an integrity report. These hash values are then stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), making them resistant to compromise by the OS or any applications."
Explain the function of the remote attestation protocol.,"The remote attestation protocol ensures that the attestation report, generated by the integrity measurement architecture, is transmitted to the client securely and without modification by attackers. It involves the TPM generating an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values. These signed hash values are then sent to the client. A trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), verifies the AIK's authenticity, and the client uses the AIK to confirm the integrity of the received hash values, thereby knowing if the loaded software is correct."
What is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip integrated into a platform. It functions as a separate co-processor, and its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software. Inside the TPM, there are components like random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and different types of crypto keys."
What are the key features of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip integrated into the platform, acting as a separate co-processor. A critical feature is that its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software. Internally, it houses random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and various types of crypto keys."
What are the internal components of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"Inside a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), there are several key components. These include a cryptographic processor which contains a random number generator, an RSA key generator, a SHA-1 hash generator, and an encryption-decryption-signature engine. Additionally, there is persistent memory storing an Endorsement Key (EK) and a Storage Root Key (SRK), and versatile memory containing Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK), along with general storage keys."
What is the purpose of the cryptographic processor within a TPM?,"The cryptographic processor within a TPM is responsible for performing various cryptographic operations. It includes a random number generator for generating unpredictable numbers, an RSA key generator for creating RSA keys, a SHA-1 hash generator for computing hash values, and an encryption-decryption-signature engine for secure data handling and authentication."
What types of memory are found inside a TPM?,"A TPM contains two main types of memory: persistent memory and versatile memory. The persistent memory stores critical keys like the Endorsement Key (EK) and the Storage Root Key (SRK). The versatile memory holds Platform Configuration Registers (PCR), which are used for integrity measurements, and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK), used for proving the TPM's identity, as well as general storage keys."
What is the significance of the Endorsement Key (EK) and Storage Root Key (SRK) in a TPM?,"The Endorsement Key (EK) and Storage Root Key (SRK) are stored in the persistent memory of a TPM. The EK is a unique key burned into the TPM during manufacturing, used for attestation and proving the TPM's identity. The SRK is a key used to protect other keys and data stored within the TPM, playing a role in securing sensitive information."
What are Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIKs) in a TPM?,"Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are part of the versatile memory in a TPM and are used to store hash values that represent the integrity of the loaded software. Attestation Identity Keys (AIKs) are also in the versatile memory and are used by the TPM to sign measurements, allowing a client to verify the TPM's identity and the integrity of the reported measurements."

What is a Chain of Trust in the context of TPM?,"A Chain of Trust, in the context of TPM, is a hierarchical system where verified systems are established from bottom to top. A computer system is viewed as a layered system where lower layers have higher privileges and can protect higher layers. Each layer is vulnerable to attacks from below if it is not secured appropriately. TPM serves as the root of trust to establish a secure boot process, continuing until the OS is fully booted and applications are running. The bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer, and it is safe to launch the top layer only after verification passes."
Explain the concept of a layered system in a Chain of Trust.,"In a Chain of Trust, a computer system is viewed as a layered system. Lower layers possess higher privileges and are capable of protecting the layers above them. However, each layer is susceptible to attacks originating from the layers below it if those lower layers are not adequately secured."
How does TPM act as the root of trust in a Chain of Trust?,"TPM serves as the root of trust by establishing a secure boot process. This process begins with the TPM and continues until the operating system (OS) has fully booted and applications are operational. The integrity of each subsequent layer is validated by the layer below it, ensuring a secure progression."
What is the validation process in a Chain of Trust?,"In a Chain of Trust, the bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer. It is considered safe to launch the top layer only when this verification process has successfully passed, ensuring the integrity of the entire chain."
What are some potential applications of a Chain of Trust with TPM?,"Potential applications of a Chain of Trust with TPM include digital rights management, enforcement of software licenses (e.g., for Microsoft Office and Outlook), and prevention of cheating in online games."
What is the process of Integrity Verification?,"Integrity Verification involves loading code from memory, computing its hash value, and verifying its signature. If the hash value matches the signature and is valid, the code is launched. Otherwise, the boot process is aborted. This process ensures that only layers that pass integrity verification are executed."
Describe the steps involved in Integrity Verification.,"The steps for Integrity Verification are: 1. Load the code from memory. 2. Compute the hash value of the code and verify its signature using a public key. 3. If the hash value matches the signature and the signature is valid, then launch the code. 4. If the hash value does not match or the signature is invalid, abort the boot process."
What happens if the hash value and signature do not match during Integrity Verification?,"If the hash value does not match the signature, or if the signature is invalid during Integrity Verification, the boot process is aborted, and an error is flagged, refusing execution."
What is the role of the Public Key and Certificate Authority in Integrity Verification?,"In Integrity Verification, the Public Key is used to verify the signature of the program binary. The Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted entity that can issue certificates for public keys, thereby vouching for their authenticity and trustworthiness. This ensures that the public key used for verification is legitimate."
How does Data Encryption with TPM work for full disk encryption?,"For full disk encryption, data is encrypted with a key stored within the TPM. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, TPM can provide platform authentication before data encryption occurs."
Why is it difficult for an attacker to steal the encryption key when using TPM for full disk encryption?,It is difficult for an attacker to steal the encryption key when using TPM for full disk encryption because the key is stored within the TPM and never leaves it. This hardware-based security prevents the key from being exposed to software-based attacks.
Explain how Windows BitLocker uses TPM for data encryption.,"In Windows BitLocker, disk data is encrypted with an encryption key called FVEK. This FVEK is then further encrypted with the Storage Root Key (SRK) which is stored in the TPM. When decrypting, BitLocker first asks the TPM to verify platform integrity. Then, it requests the TPM to decrypt FVEK using SRK. Finally, BitLocker uses the decrypted FVEK to decrypt the actual data. This ensures data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the correct software launched."
What is FVEK in the context of Windows BitLocker and TPM?,"FVEK stands for Full Volume Encryption Key. In Windows BitLocker, disk data is encrypted using the FVEK. This FVEK is then protected by being encrypted with the Storage Root Key (SRK) residing in the TPM."
What is the role of SRK in Windows BitLocker's data decryption process?,"The Storage Root Key (SRK) in the TPM plays a crucial role in the decryption process for Windows BitLocker. After verifying platform integrity, BitLocker asks the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once the FVEK is decrypted, it can then be used to decrypt the actual disk data."
How does the combination of TPM and BitLocker ensure secure data decryption?,"The combination of TPM and BitLocker ensures secure data decryption by tying the decryption process to the specific platform and its software. The FVEK is protected by the SRK in the TPM, and the TPM must first verify the platform's integrity before decrypting the FVEK. This prevents unauthorized decryption of data on incorrect platforms or with unauthorized software."
What is the purpose of the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) generated by the TPM?,The Attestation Identity Key (AIK) is generated by the TPM to sign the hash values of the loaded software. This signed information is then sent to the client. The AIK acts as a credential that allows the client to verify that the reported hash values originate from a genuine TPM on the correct platform.
How is the AIK used to verify the authenticity of hash values?,"The AIK is used to verify the authenticity of hash values by signing them. The client receives the hash values along with the AIK. A trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), can verify that the AIK is indeed from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to confirm that the received hash values are authentic and have not been tampered with."
What is the role of the Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) in remote attestation?,The Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) is a trusted third party involved in remote attestation. Its role is to verify that the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) being presented by the TPM is indeed from the correct and legitimate platform. This verification adds a layer of trust to the attestation process.
How does a client use the AIK to confirm software integrity?,"A client uses the AIK to confirm software integrity by verifying that the received hash values are authentic. The AIK, signed by the TPM, serves as proof of origin. By checking the hash values against known good values, and trusting the AIK's authenticity (potentially verified by a PCA), the client can determine if the loaded software on the remote platform is correct."
What information is sent from the TPM to the client during remote attestation?,"During remote attestation, the TPM sends the hash values of the loaded software, along with the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) which is used to sign these hash values, to the client."
Compare remote attestation with basic functionality of remote attestation.,"The basic functionality of remote attestation is a mechanism allowing a user to know if their app executes securely on a trusted platform by receiving unforgeable evidence about the software's security. Remote attestation, as a more detailed process, involves the TPM measuring software integrity (using hash values stored in PCRs), generating an AIK to sign these measurements, and transmitting this signed report to the client. A PCA may verify the AIK, and the client uses the AIK to confirm the authenticity of the hash values, thus verifying the software's integrity."
What is the relationship between PCRs and integrity measurement architecture?,"Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are integral to the integrity measurement architecture. The integrity measurement architecture measures the hash values of loaded software to create an integrity report. These hash values are then stored within the PCRs in the TPM, ensuring they are protected from compromise by the OS or applications."
What is the purpose of encrypting FVEK with SRK in BitLocker?,"Encrypting FVEK (Full Volume Encryption Key) with SRK (Storage Root Key) in BitLocker serves to protect the FVEK. The SRK is securely stored within the TPM. By encrypting FVEK with SRK, the key is shielded from direct exposure, and its use for decrypting data is contingent on the TPM's ability to access and utilize the SRK, which in turn requires platform integrity verification."
How does TPM ensure that its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software?,"A TPM is designed as a separate co-processor, and its internal state is isolated from the main host system's software. This architectural separation prevents malicious host system software, such as the operating system or applications, from directly accessing or altering the TPM's sensitive data and operational state."
What is the significance of 'unforgeable evidence' in remote attestation?,"Unforgeable evidence in remote attestation means that the evidence provided by the remote platform about its software's security cannot be faked or altered by an attacker. This is typically achieved through cryptographic means, such as digital signatures generated by the TPM using its unique keys, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the attestation report."
