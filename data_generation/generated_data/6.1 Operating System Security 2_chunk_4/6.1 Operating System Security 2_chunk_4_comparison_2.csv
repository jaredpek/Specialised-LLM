What is the basic functionality of remote attestation?,Remote attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. This is achieved by a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. A common strategy involves proving that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What are the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the integrity measurement architecture and the remote attestation protocol. The integrity measurement architecture is responsible for providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. The remote attestation protocol ensures that this attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers on the OS, apps, or network."
Compare the integrity measurement architecture with the remote attestation protocol.,"The integrity measurement architecture focuses on generating a reliable and trustworthy security report by measuring the integrity of loaded software. In contrast, the remote attestation protocol focuses on the secure transmission of this report. It ensures that the attestation report is sent to the client without being tampered with by attackers across the OS, applications, or network."
"Explain the concept of a ""chain of trust"" in the context of TPM.","A ""chain of trust"" establishes verified systems from the bottom up. In a hierarchical computer system, lower layers possess higher privileges and can protect upper layers. Each layer is vulnerable to attacks from below if it is not secured appropriately. The TPM acts as the root of trust, initiating a secure boot process that continues until the OS is fully booted and applications are running. The bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer, and it is only safe to launch the top layer once this verification is successful."
