Define the concept of Remote Attestation.,Remote Attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. It involves a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. A common strategy employed is to prove that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What are the key components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the Integrity measurement architecture and the Remote attestation protocol. The Integrity measurement architecture is responsible for providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. The Remote attestation protocol ensures that the attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers in the OS, apps, or network."
Explain the Integrity measurement architecture in the context of remote attestation.,"The Integrity measurement architecture, in the context of remote attestation, involves the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measuring hash values of each loaded software component. These hash values serve as an integrity report and are stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within the TPM. This storage mechanism prevents compromise by the operating system (OS) or any applications."
Describe the Remote attestation protocol.,"The Remote attestation protocol is a process where the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) generates an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to the client. A trusted third party, known as a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), is involved to verify that the AIK originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to authenticate the received hash values. By examining these hash values, the client can determine if the loaded software is correct."
What is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip that is integrated into a platform. It functions as a separate co-processor, and its state is designed to be invulnerable to compromise by malicious host system software. The TPM contains various components for security functions."
What are the key functionalities inside a TPM chip?,"Inside a TPM chip, there are several key functionalities. These include random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and support for different types of cryptographic keys. The chip also houses persistent memory, which stores elements like the Endorsement Key (EK) and the Storage Root Key (SRK), and versatile memory, which holds Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) and Attestation Identity Keys (AIK), along with storage keys."
Who designed the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and what are its version release history?,"The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) was designed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). The first version, TPM 1.1b, was released in 2003. An improved version, TPM 1.2, was developed between approximately 2005 and 2009, becoming equipped in PCs in 2006 and servers in 2008, and was standardized by ISO and IEC in 2009. An upgraded version, TPM 2.0, was released on April 9, 2014."
What are some applications of TPM?,"TPM has several applications, including Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and Microsoft Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB). Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 as a minimal system requirement. The Linux kernel began supporting TPM 2.0 from version 3.20 onwards. Google incorporates TPMs into Chromebooks as part of their security model, and virtualization platforms like VMware, Xen, and KVM all support virtualized TPM."
Explain the concept of a Chain of Trust with TPM.,"A Chain of Trust is established by verifying systems from the bottom layer upwards. In a hierarchical view, a computer system is a layered system where lower layers have higher privileges and can protect higher layers. Each layer is susceptible to attacks from below if it is not secured appropriately. The TPM acts as the root of trust, initiating a secure boot process that continues until the OS is fully booted and applications are running. The bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer, and it is only safe to launch the top layer once this verification is successful."
What are the potential applications of a Chain of Trust built with TPM?,"Potential applications of a Chain of Trust built with TPM include digital rights management, enforcement of software licenses (e.g., for Microsoft Office and Outlook), and prevention of cheating in online games. The layered structure of a system, from hardware to applications, can be secured through this process."
Describe the process of Integrity Verification.,"Integrity Verification ensures that only layers passing the verification are launched. The process involves loading code from memory, computing its hash value, and verifying its signature. If the hash value matches the signature and is valid, the code is launched. Otherwise, the boot process is aborted. This verification is often facilitated by a public key and a certificate authority."
"How does Data Encryption with TPM work, specifically for full disk encryption?","For full disk encryption using TPM, the data is encrypted with a key stored within the TPM. This makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to steal the encryption key, as it never leaves the TPM. Additionally, the TPM can provide platform authentication before the data encryption process begins. This ensures that only a legitimate and secure platform can access the encrypted data."
Explain how Windows BitLocker utilizes TPM for data encryption.,"In Windows BitLocker, disk data is encrypted using an encryption key called FVEK. This FVEK is then further encrypted by the Storage Root Key (SRK), which is securely stored within the TPM. When decrypting the data, BitLocker first prompts the TPM to verify the platform's integrity. Subsequently, it requests the TPM to decrypt the FVEK using the SRK. Once the FVEK is decrypted, BitLocker can then use it to decrypt the actual data. This process ensures that data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the appropriate software launched."
What is the role of the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) in remote attestation with TPM?,"The Attestation Identity Key (AIK) plays a crucial role in remote attestation with TPM. The TPM generates the AIK to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These signed hash values, along with the AIK, are then transmitted to the client.
