What is remote attestation?,Remote attestation is a mechanism that allows a user to verify if their application is executing securely on a trusted platform. It involves a remote platform providing unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client. A common strategy for this is to prove that the software running on the platform is intact and trustworthy.
What are the major components for remote attestation?,"The major components for remote attestation are the integrity measurement architecture and the remote attestation protocol. The integrity measurement architecture is responsible for providing a reliable and trustworthy security report. The remote attestation protocol ensures that this attestation report is transmitted to the client without being modified by attackers, whether they target the OS, applications, or the network."
Explain the integrity measurement architecture in the context of remote attestation.,"The integrity measurement architecture, in the context of remote attestation, involves the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) measuring hash values of each loaded software component. These hash values serve as an integrity report and are stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) within the TPM. This storage mechanism prevents the hash values from being compromised by the operating system (OS) or any applications."
Describe the remote attestation protocol.,"The remote attestation protocol is a process where the TPM generates an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values of the loaded software. These hash values, along with the AIK, are then sent to the client. A trusted third party, known as a Privacy Certification Authority (PCA), is involved to verify that the AIK originates from the correct platform. The client then uses this AIK to authenticate the received hash values, thereby determining if the loaded software is correct."
What is a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?,"A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a chip that is integrated into a platform. It functions as a separated co-processor, and its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software. Inside the TPM, there are components such as random number and key generators, a crypto execution engine, and different types of crypto keys."

How is a chain of trust built with TPM?,"A chain of trust is established with TPM by building verified systems from the bottom up. A computer system is viewed as a layered system where lower layers have higher privileges and can protect higher layers. Each layer is vulnerable to attacks from below if not secured properly. The TPM acts as the root of trust, initiating a secure boot process that continues until the OS is fully booted and applications are running. The bottom layer validates the integrity of the top layer, and it is only safe to launch the top layer once this verification is successful."
What does 'Chain of Trust' mean in the context of TPM?,"In the context of TPM, a 'Chain of Trust' refers to the process of establishing verified systems from the bottom layer to the top layer. This hierarchical approach ensures that each layer of the system is secured and validated, starting from the foundational elements and progressing upwards.

Describe the process of integrity verification.,"Integrity verification involves loading code from memory, computing its hash value, and verifying its signature. If the hash value matches the signature and is valid, the code is launched. Otherwise, the boot process is aborted. This process ensures that only authentic and untampered code is executed."
How does the integrity verification process work with a program binary and signature?,"During integrity verification, the program binary and its signature are processed. A hash value is computed from the binary, and this hash is then used to verify the signature. This verification is often done in conjunction with a public key and a certificate authority. If the hash matches the signature and is deemed valid, the execution continues. If not, an error is flagged, and execution is refused."
What happens if the hash value and signature do not match during integrity verification?,"If the hash value and signature do not match during integrity verification, it indicates that the code may have been tampered with or is not authentic. In such cases, an error is flagged, and the execution of the code is refused, thereby aborting the boot process to maintain system security."
