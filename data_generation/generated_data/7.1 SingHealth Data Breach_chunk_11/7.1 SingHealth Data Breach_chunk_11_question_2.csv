What are the recommendations for securing domain controllers against attack?,"To better secure domain controllers against attack, the following measures are recommended:
1. The operating system for domain controllers should be updated more regularly to harden these servers against the risk of cyber attack.
2. The attack surface for domain controllers should be reduced by limiting login access.
3. Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a security token or a mobile phone)."
How can the attack surface of domain controllers be reduced?,"The attack surface of domain controllers can be reduced by limiting login access. The attack surface refers to the sum of the different points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. By limiting who can log in, the number of potential entry points for attackers is decreased."
