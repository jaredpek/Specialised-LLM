What are the recommendations for securing domain controllers against attack?,"To better secure domain controllers against attack, the following measures are recommended:\n\n1.  **Operating System Updates:** The operating system for domain controllers must be updated more regularly. This process, known as hardening, strengthens these servers against the risk of cyber attacks.\n2.  **Reduced Attack Surface:** The attack surface for domain controllers should be minimized by limiting login access. The attack surface refers to the sum of the different points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment.\n3.  **Two-Factor Authentication:** Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication. This is a security process that requires the user to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselvesâ€”typically a password and a code from a mobile device or other hardware token."
Explain the importance of regular operating system updates for domain controllers.,"Regularly updating the operating system for domain controllers is crucial for hardening these servers against the risk of cyber attack. Updates often include security patches that address newly discovered vulnerabilities, thereby reducing the potential entry points for attackers."
How can the attack surface of domain controllers be reduced?,"The attack surface of domain controllers can be reduced by limiting login access. This means restricting who can attempt to log in to these critical servers, thereby decreasing the number of potential points of entry for malicious actors."
What is required for administrative access to domain controllers?,Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication. This security measure adds an extra layer of protection by demanding two distinct forms of verification from administrators before granting access.
What is Recommendation #11 regarding patch management?,Recommendation #11 states that a robust patch management process must be implemented to address security vulnerabilities.
