What is the purpose of hardening servers?,"Hardening servers is a process of securing them by reducing their attack surface and potential vulnerabilities. This is achieved through various measures, such as regularly updating the operating system with security patches, limiting unnecessary services and access, and implementing strong authentication mechanisms. The goal is to make the servers more resilient to cyber attacks."
Explain the concept of 'attack surface' in the context of domain controllers.,"The 'attack surface' of a system, such as a domain controller, refers to the sum of all possible points where an unauthorized user can try to enter data into or extract data from the system. Reducing the attack surface means minimizing these potential entry points. For domain controllers, this is achieved by limiting login access, which directly reduces the number of credentials that can be targeted by attackers."
What is the significance of two-factor authentication for administrative access?,"Two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrative access significantly enhances security by requiring users to provide two distinct forms of identification before granting access. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a code from a mobile app or a physical token). This layered approach makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain administrative control, even if they manage to steal a password."
Why is a 'robust' patch management process recommended?,"A 'robust' patch management process is recommended to effectively address security vulnerabilities. Robustness implies that the process is comprehensive, reliable, and consistently applied. It ensures that security patches are identified, tested, and deployed in a timely manner across all relevant systems, thereby minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit known weaknesses."
What are 'appropriate metrics' in the context of patch management oversight?,"Appropriate metrics in the context of patch management oversight are quantifiable measures used to assess the performance and effectiveness of the patching process. Examples could include the percentage of systems patched within a certain timeframe, the number of critical vulnerabilities outstanding, the average time to patch a vulnerability, or the success rate of patch deployments. These metrics provide data-driven insights for monitoring and improving the patch management strategy."
What does 'cyber resilience' mean in the context of software upgrades?,"Cyber resilience, in the context of software upgrades, refers to the ability of an organization's IT systems to withstand, adapt to, and recover from cyber threats and attacks.
