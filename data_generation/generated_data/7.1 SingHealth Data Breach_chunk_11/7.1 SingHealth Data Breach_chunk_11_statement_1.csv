What are the recommendations for securing domain controllers against attack?,"To better secure domain controllers against attack, the following measures should be implemented:
1.  **Regular Operating System Updates:** The operating system for domain controllers must be updated more regularly. This process, known as patching, hardens these servers against the risk of cyber attacks by addressing known vulnerabilities.
2.  **Reduce Attack Surface:** The attack surface, which represents the sum of all possible points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment, should be reduced. This can be achieved by limiting login access to domain controllers.
3.  **Two-Factor Authentication for Administrative Access:** Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity, adding an extra layer of security beyond just a password."
