It is a critical step in a comprehensive post-breach review."
Compare the focus of patch management versus software upgrades.,"Patch management primarily focuses on applying small, targeted updates (patches) to existing software to fix specific bugs or security vulnerabilities, maintaining the current version's integrity and security. Software upgrades, on the other hand, involve installing newer, often significantly different, versions of software. The focus of software upgrades, especially when emphasizing cyber resilience, is on adopting enhanced features, improved architectures, and potentially more robust security mechanisms inherent in the new version, rather than just fixing issues in the existing one."
What is the difference between internet surfing separation and internet isolation technology in minimizing exposure to external threats?,"Internet surfing separation involves segmenting network traffic so that general internet browsing activities are kept separate from critical systems and sensitive data. This limits the potential pathways for threats to reach vital resources. Internet isolation technology takes this a step further by creating a completely separate, virtualized environment for browsing. Any activity within this isolated environment, including malware execution, is contained and does not affect the user's primary operating system or the network, offering a higher level of protection against external threats."
What is the role of a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in responding to security incidents?,"The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) plays a vital role in responding to security incidents. Their responsibilities include detecting, analyzing, and mitigating cyber threats. To do this effectively, they need to be well-trained to understand various attack vectors and response protocols, and well-equipped with the necessary hardware and software tools to investigate incidents, contain breaches, and restore affected systems."
What is the purpose of a post-breach independent forensic review of endpoints?,"A post-breach independent forensic review of endpoints aims to thoroughly examine each individual device (endpoint) that was connected to the network during or after a security breach. The purpose is to uncover evidence of compromise, identify any malicious software or unauthorized access, determine the extent of data exfiltration or damage, and ensure that no attacker traces remain on these devices. This detailed examination is crucial for understanding the full impact of the breach and for strengthening future defenses."
