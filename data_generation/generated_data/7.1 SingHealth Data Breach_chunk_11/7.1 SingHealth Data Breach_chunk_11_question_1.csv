What are the recommendations for securing domain controllers against attack?,"To better secure domain controllers against attack, the following measures are recommended: 
1. The operating system for domain controllers should be updated more regularly to harden these servers against the risk of cyber attack. 
2. The attack surface for domain controllers should be reduced by limiting login access. 
3. Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication is a security process that requires the user to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. This is typically a password (something the user knows) and a code from a mobile app or hardware token (something the user has)."
What is the definition of a domain controller and why is it important to secure it?,"A domain controller is a server that manages access and security for computers within a network. It is crucial to secure domain controllers because they hold sensitive information and control access to network resources. The provided document recommends that domain controllers must be better secured against attack. This involves regularly updating their operating systems to harden them against cyber attacks, reducing their attack surface by limiting login access, and requiring two-factor authentication for administrative access. Two-factor authentication is a security process that requires the user to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves, typically a password and a code from a mobile app or hardware token."
How can the attack surface of domain controllers be reduced?,"The attack surface of domain controllers can be reduced by limiting login access. The attack surface refers to the sum of the different points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. By limiting who can log in and how they can log in, the potential entry points for attackers are decreased."
