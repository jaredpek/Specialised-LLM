Define the concept of privilege escalation and lateral movement in the context of cybersecurity.,"Privilege escalation refers to the act of exploiting a vulnerability in a system to gain elevated access rights. Lateral movement is the technique attackers use to move through a network after gaining initial access, typically to reach high-value targets. The period from December 2017 to June 2018 saw evidence of both these activities."
Describe the evidence found regarding the attacker's lateral movements.,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was observed in the proliferation of malware across numerous endpoints and servers. Malware samples analyzed by CSA were either designed to be stealthy or were unique variants not previously seen in the wild, and importantly, were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions."
What types of malware were identified as part of the attacker's lateral movement strategy?,"The malware identified included RAT 1, which is a Remote Access Trojan. Another such malware was referred to in the report as ""RAT 2"". Additionally, malware associated with an earlier-mentioned log file was also part of this strategy."
Explain how PowerShell commands were used by the attacker.,"PowerShell commands were utilized by the attacker to distribute malware to infect other machines. Furthermore, these commands facilitated the copying of malicious files between machines over mapped network drives, contributing to the attacker's lateral movement within the network."
What was CSA's assessment regarding the attacker's compromise of the Windows authentication system?,"CSA assessed that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system. This compromise allowed the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials, which would grant them significant control over the network."
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications. They also gained control over all employee workstations and the underlying data within the domain."
Describe the incident of establishing control over Workstation B.,"On April 17, 2018, the attacker gained access to Workstation B (SGH). Following this access, they planted RAT 2, thereby gaining control of the workstation. This workstation subsequently had access to the SCM application."
How was Workstation B utilized by the attacker after gaining control?,"Once control of Workstation B was established, it was used by the attacker to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. This allowed the attacker to expand their reach within the network infrastructure."

This makes them appear as if they are local drives, allowing users to access files and folders on the network easily."
"What are ""administrator and user credentials""?",Administrator and user credentials are the unique identifiers (username) and secret codes (passwords) used to authenticate and gain access to a computer system or network. Administrator credentials typically grant higher levels of access and control than standard user credentials.
"What is meant by ""full control"" over servers, applications, and workstations?","Having ""full control"" implies the ability to perform any action on the specified systems. This includes installing or removing software, modifying configurations, accessing and deleting data, and generally managing the system without any restrictions."
"What is a ""domain"" in the context of a computer network?","In a computer network, a domain is a logical grouping of computers and devices that share a common security policy and administration. It is typically managed by a central directory service, such as Active Directory in Windows environments."
"What is the SCM application, and why was it significant in this incident?","The SCM application is an application that Workstation B had access to. Its significance lies in the fact that after the attacker gained control of Workstation B, they also gained access to this SCM application, which was likely a target or a means to further their objectives."
What are SGH Citrix Servers?,"SGH Citrix Servers are servers managed by SingHealth (SGH) that utilize Citrix technology. Citrix is a company that provides virtualization, networking, and cloud computing technologies. These servers were likely used to provide remote access to applications and desktops for employees."
"What is a ""database schema""?","A database schema defines the structure of a database. It includes information about tables, columns, data types, relationships between tables, and other constraints. Reconnaissance on the schema helps an attacker understand how the data is organized."
"What is the purpose of ""reconnaissance"" in the context of cybersecurity attacks?","Reconnaissance is the initial phase of a cyberattack where the attacker gathers information about the target system or network. This information is used to identify vulnerabilities and plan subsequent attack steps. In this case, it involved understanding the SCM database schema."
"What are ""direct queries relating to particular individuals""?","These are SQL queries specifically designed to retrieve information about individual patients within the SCM database. Instead of broad searches, these queries targeted specific records based on certain criteria, likely to extract personal details of individuals."
"What are ""bulk queries on patients in general""?",Bulk queries on patients in general are broad SQL queries that retrieve large amounts of data about many patients simultaneously. This is distinct from targeting specific individuals and suggests an intent to gather extensive information about the patient population.
What is an NRIC number?,"An NRIC number is the National Registration Identity Card number, which is a unique identification number issued to citizens and permanent residents in Singapore. It is a form of personal identification."
"What is the significance of retrieving ""outpatient dispensed medication records""?","Retrieving outpatient dispensed medication records provides insight into the medications individuals have received. This information can be sensitive and potentially used for various malicious purposes, such as identity theft, blackmail, or targeted phishing attacks."
"What is the ""data exfiltration route""?",The data exfiltration route refers to the path and methods used by an attacker to steal data from a compromised system or network and transfer it to an external location under their control. The diagram illustrates the specific path taken in this incident.
"What is the role of ""IHiS"" in the context of the SingHealth Cyber Breach?","IHiS, likely referring to Integrated Health Information Systems, is an organization whose staff discovered the unusual queries against the SCM database. They took steps to stop the data exfiltration and prevent future similar incidents."
"What is the purpose of ""command and control"" in cybersecurity?","Command and control (C2) refers to the infrastructure and methods used by attackers to communicate with and manage compromised systems. It allows them to issue commands, receive data, and direct the actions of malware or compromised hosts remotely."
"What are ""footholds"" in a computer network from an attacker's perspective?","Footholds, in cybersecurity, refer to any compromised systems or access points within a network that an attacker can use to maintain persistence and launch further attacks. These could be backdoors, malware installations, or compromised user accounts."
What is the timeframe covered by the report on privilege escalation and lateral movement?,"The report covers the period from December 2017 to June 2018, detailing the attacker's activities related to privilege escalation and lateral movement within the SingHealth network."
"What is the significance of malware being ""not detected by standard anti-malware solutions""?","Malware that is not detected by standard anti-malware solutions is particularly dangerous because it bypasses common security defenses. This implies the malware is either very new, uses advanced evasion techniques, or is specifically tailored to avoid detection by signature-based or heuristic analysis."
How did the attacker gain control of Workstation B?,"The attacker gained access to Workstation B (SGH) and subsequently planted RAT 2 on it, which resulted in them gaining control of the workstation."
What was the date when the attacker began querying the SCM database?,"The attacker began querying the SCM database on June 26, 2018."
