Provide a comprehensive summary of the privilege escalation and lateral movement activities that occurred between December 2017 and June 2018.,"Between December 2017 and June 2018, attackers engaged in privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network. Evidence of lateral movements was observed through the proliferation of malware across numerous endpoints and servers. The malware samples analyzed were either designed to be stealthy or were unique variants not previously seen in the wild, evading detection by standard anti-malware solutions. This malware included RAT 1, also referred to as RAT 2 (a Remote Access Trojan), and other malware linked to a specific log file. PowerShell commands were utilized by the attacker to distribute malware and infect other machines, with malicious files being copied between machines via mapped network drives. The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) assessed that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system, obtaining both administrator and user credentials. This compromise granted the attacker full control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. On April 17, 2018, control was established over Workstation B, allowing the attacker to plant RAT 2 and gain control of the workstation, which had access to the SCM application. Workstation B was subsequently used for remote logins to SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2."
Summarize the types of malware used and their characteristics during the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase.,"During the privilege escalation and lateral movement phase, the attacker utilized malware that was either stealthy by design or consisted of unique variants not previously detected in the wild by standard anti-malware solutions. These malware samples were capable of evading typical security measures. Specifically, the malware included RAT 1, identified as a Remote Access Trojan, and another variant referred to as RAT 2. Additionally, other malware associated with a specific log file was also employed. These malicious tools were distributed across various endpoints and servers, indicating the attacker's lateral movement within the network."
Explain how the attacker achieved lateral movement and gained control over multiple systems.,"The attacker achieved lateral movement and gained control over multiple systems through several methods. Evidence of lateral movement was found in the proliferation of malware across numerous endpoints and servers. PowerShell commands were used to distribute malware and infect other machines, and malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives. The attacker also compromised the Windows authentication system, obtaining administrator and user credentials. This allowed them to gain full control over Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain. The establishment of control over Workstation B on April 17, 2018, was a key step, where RAT 2 was planted, granting control of the workstation which had access to the SCM application. This compromised workstation was then used to log in remotely to SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2."
What was the role of PowerShell commands in the attacker's activities?,"PowerShell commands played a significant role in the attacker's activities by being used to distribute malware to infect other machines. Additionally, these commands facilitated the copying of malicious files between machines over mapped network drives, contributing to the attacker's lateral movement and control within the network."
Describe the extent of control the attacker gained after compromising the Windows authentication system.,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over the network. This encompassed all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, as well as all employee workstations and the underlying data within the domain."
"Detail the events that occurred on April 17, 2018, related to Workstation B.","On April 17, 2018, the attacker established control over Workstation B. This involved gaining access to Workstation B (SGH) and planting RAT 2, a Remote Access Trojan. This action resulted in the attacker gaining control of the workstation, which importantly, had access to the SCM application. Following this, Workstation B was utilized to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2."
How was Workstation B used by the attacker after gaining control?,"After gaining control of Workstation B, the attacker used it to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. This indicated that Workstation B served as a pivot point for further access within the network."
"Summarize the attacker's actions related to the SCM database between June 26 and July 4, 2018.","Between June 26 and July 4, 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database from Citrix Server 2 using the A.A. account. During this period, three types of SQL queries were executed: reconnaissance on the SCM database schema, direct queries for specific individuals' information, and bulk queries concerning patients in general. These queries allowed the attacker to retrieve sensitive data, including the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data, demographic records of 1,495,364 patients, and outpatient dispensed medication records for approximately 159,000 patients."
What types of SQL queries did the attacker run against the SCM database?,"The attacker ran three types of SQL queries against the SCM database: (i) reconnaissance queries to understand the schema of the SCM database, (ii) direct queries to retrieve information about particular individuals, and (iii) bulk queries to gather general patient data."
What specific information was retrieved by the attacker from the SCM database through SQL queries?,"Through SQL queries, the attacker was able to retrieve the following information: 1. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. 2. The demographic records of 1,495,364 patients, which included their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. 3. The outpatient dispensed medication records of approximately 159,000 of the 1,495,364 patients."
Describe the data exfiltration route used by the attacker.,"The data exfiltration route involved the attacker accessing the SCM database via Citrix Server 2. From there, data was likely exfiltrated through Workstation A, which then communicated with C2 (Command and Control) servers. This process is depicted as a route from the SCM DB Server to Citrix Server 2, then to Workstation A, and finally to C2 servers, labeled as 'Exfiltration'."
When and how was the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database stopped?,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped on July 4, 2018. This occurred after staff from IHiS (Integrated Health Information Systems) discovered unusual queries being run against the SCM database. Following this discovery, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being executed."
What recommendations were made by CSA after the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server?,"After the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented. The purpose of this recommendation was to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds they might have had within the network."
"When was internet surfing separation implemented, and what was its effect?","Internet surfing separation was implemented on July 20, 2018. Following this implementation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected."
What were the characteristics of the malware samples found and analyzed by CSA?,"The malware samples found and analyzed by CSA exhibited two key characteristics: they were either stealthy by design, meaning they were created to avoid detection, or they were unique variants that had not been observed in the wild before. Crucially, these malware samples were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions."
Can you summarize the key considerations behind the attacker's lateral movement strategy?,"The attacker's lateral movement strategy was characterized by the proliferation of malware across multiple endpoints and servers. This was facilitated by using stealthy or novel malware variants that evaded standard anti-malware detection. Furthermore, the attacker leveraged PowerShell commands to distribute malware and copy malicious files between machines via mapped network drives. Compromising the Windows authentication system to gain administrator and user credentials was also a critical aspect, enabling broad control over servers, applications, workstations, and data."
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to remotely control a victim's computer. It operates by appearing as a legitimate program, but once installed, it allows the attacker to access files, monitor activity, and execute commands on the compromised system without the user's knowledge."
Explain the significance of 'stealthy by design' malware.,"Malware that is 'stealthy by design' refers to malicious software engineered with the specific intention of evading detection by security software and system administrators. This involves employing techniques such as code obfuscation, anti-debugging measures, and the ability to blend in with normal system processes. The goal is to remain undetected for as long as possible, allowing the attacker to achieve their objectives without being discovered."
What are 'mapped network drives' and how were they used by the attacker?,"Mapped network drives are network resources, such as shared folders on other computers or servers, that are assigned a drive letter on a user's local computer. This makes them appear as if they are local drives, allowing for easier access. The attacker used mapped network drives to copy malicious files between machines, facilitating the spread of malware and their lateral movement across the network."
What is the Windows authentication system and why is its compromise significant?,"The Windows authentication system is the mechanism by which users and devices are verified for access to Windows-based networks and resources. It typically involves user credentials like usernames and passwords. Compromising this system is highly significant because it allows an attacker to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access, potentially obtaining administrator privileges, which grants them extensive control over the entire network, including servers, applications, and user data."
Define 'administrator credentials' in the context of network security.,"Administrator credentials refer to the username and password combination that grants the highest level of access and control over a computer system or network. Possessing administrator credentials allows a user to install software, modify system settings, access all files, and manage user accounts. In the context of a network breach, obtaining administrator credentials is a critical objective for attackers as it enables them to exert complete control over the compromised environment."
What does it mean for an attacker to have 'full control' over a network?,"Having 'full control' over a network means that an attacker can perform any action they desire within that network without restriction. This includes accessing, modifying, or deleting any data; installing or removing software; creating or deleting user accounts; reconfiguring system settings; and using the network's resources for their own purposes. Essentially, the attacker becomes the de facto administrator of the entire network infrastructure."
What are 'hosted applications' in a network environment?,"'Hosted applications' are software programs that are installed and run on servers within a network, rather than directly on individual user workstations. Users access these applications remotely, often through a network connection. Examples include enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) software, or shared productivity tools. Gaining control over hosted applications allows an attacker to access sensitive business data and disrupt operations."
What is meant by 'underlying data' within a domain?,"'Underlying data' within a domain refers to all the information stored and managed by the systems within that network domain. This can include a wide range of data, such as financial records, customer information, employee details, intellectual property, operational logs, and any other digital assets. Control over this data is often a primary objective for attackers."
What is a 'domain' in the context of computer networks?,"In computer networking, a 'domain' typically refers to a logical grouping of computers and devices that share a common administration and security policy. In a Windows environment, this is often managed by a domain controller, which authenticates users and controls access to network resources. Operating within a domain allows for centralized management and ensures consistency across the network."
"What is the SCM application, and why was its access by the attacker significant?","The SCM application is not explicitly defined in the provided text, but its access by the attacker was significant because Workstation B, after being compromised and having RAT 2 planted, had access to it. This implies that the SCM application likely contained sensitive information or functionalities that the attacker sought to exploit or gain further access through."
"What are SGH Citrix Servers, and how were they accessed by the attacker?",SGH Citrix Servers are likely servers managed by Singapore General Hospital (SGH) that utilize Citrix technology. Citrix technology typically enables remote access to applications and desktops. The attacker accessed these servers remotely by using the compromised Workstation B as a login point after gaining control of it and planting RAT 2.
What is a 'log file' in the context of cybersecurity incidents?,"A log file is a record of events that occur on a computer system or network. These events can include system activities, user actions, application processes, and security-related occurrences. In cybersecurity, log files are crucial for investigating incidents, as they provide a chronological trail of activities that can help identify how a breach occurred, what systems were affected, and what actions the attacker took."
What is the 'SCM database' and what kind of data did it contain?,"The SCM database is a database that contained sensitive patient information. Specifically, it held the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data, demographic records for 1,495,364 patients (including names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth), and outpatient dispensed medication records for approximately 159,000 patients."
What is a 'schema' of a database?,"The 'schema' of a database refers to its logical structure or blueprint. It defines how the data is organized, including the tables, the columns within those tables, the data types of each column, and the relationships between different tables. Understanding the database schema is essential for querying and retrieving specific data effectively."
What are 'direct queries' in the context of database access?,"'Direct queries' in the context of database access refer to specific requests made to the database to retrieve particular pieces of information. In this case, the attacker used direct queries to target information relating to particular individuals within the SCM database, as opposed to broader reconnaissance or bulk data retrieval."
What are 'bulk queries' on patients?,"'Bulk queries' on patients refer to database queries designed to retrieve a large volume of patient data simultaneously, rather than focusing on individual records. In this scenario, the attacker used bulk queries to gather general information about patients from the SCM database."
What is 'demographic data'?,"'Demographic data' refers to statistical information about populations. In the context of patient records, it typically includes characteristics such as names, NRIC numbers (National Registration Identity Card numbers, a unique identifier in some countries), addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. This type of data is often used for identification and statistical analysis."
What is 'outpatient medication data'?,"'Outpatient medication data' refers to records of medications prescribed or dispensed to patients who are not admitted to a hospital. This includes information about the specific drugs, dosages, frequency, and duration of treatment for patients receiving care outside of an inpatient setting."
What is 'data exfiltration'?,"'Data exfiltration' is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer system or network to an external location. It is a common objective in cyberattacks, where attackers steal sensitive information such as personal data, financial records, or intellectual property."
What are 'C2 servers'?,"'C2 servers' stand for Command and Control servers. These are servers used by attackers to remotely communicate with and control compromised systems (bots or malware) within a victim's network. They act as a central hub for issuing commands, receiving stolen data, and managing the overall attack infrastructure."
What is 'IHiS' and what role did they play in stopping the data exfiltration?,"IHiS stands for Integrated Health Information Systems. Staff from IHiS played a crucial role in stopping the data exfiltration by discovering the unusual queries being run against the SCM database. Upon this discovery, they took immediate steps to prevent further similar queries and thus halted the unauthorized copying and exfiltration of data."
What is 'internet surfing separation' and why was it recommended?,"'Internet surfing separation' is a security measure designed to isolate a network or specific systems from direct internet access. It was recommended to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds they might have had in the network. By separating internet access, the attacker's ability to communicate with their C2 servers and direct further malicious activities is significantly hindered."
What is a 'foothold' in the context of network security?,"In network security, a 'foothold' refers to a point of entry or a compromised system within a network that an attacker has gained access to. It serves as a base from which the attacker can launch further attacks, move laterally, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the network, even if initial access points are secured."
What does it mean for malicious activity to be 'detected'?,"When malicious activity is 'detected,' it means that security systems, software, or human monitoring have identified signs or indicators of unauthorized or harmful actions occurring within a computer system or network. This detection can trigger alerts, initiate defensive measures, and prompt investigations into the nature and extent of the activity."
Summarize the timeline of key events from December 2017 to July 2018 related to the cyber breach.,"The period from December 2017 to June 2018 was characterized by privilege escalation and lateral movement, involving malware proliferation, the use of PowerShell for distribution, and the compromise of the Windows authentication system. On April 17, 2018, the attacker gained control of Workstation B and planted RAT 2. From June 26 to July 4, 2018, the attacker queried the SCM database, retrieving sensitive patient data. The data exfiltration was stopped on July 4, 2018, by IHiS staff. Following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended internet surfing separation, which was implemented on July 20, 2018. No further malicious activity was detected after this date."
What was the primary objective of the attacker's actions between December 2017 and June 2018?,"The primary objective of the attacker's actions between December 2017 and June 2018 was privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network. This involved gaining unauthorized access to systems, moving across different endpoints and servers, and ultimately achieving a high level of control over the network infrastructure and its data."
How did the attacker leverage compromised credentials?,"The attacker leveraged compromised credentials, specifically administrator and user credentials obtained by compromising the Windows authentication system. This allowed them to gain full control over the network, including Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain."
What was the impact of the attacker gaining control over employee workstations and underlying data?,"The impact of the attacker gaining control over employee workstations and underlying data was significant. It meant that all employee workstations and all the data stored within the domain were accessible and controllable by the attacker. This could lead to data theft, data manipulation, disruption of operations, and potential privacy violations."
Describe the sequence of events leading to the querying of the SCM database.,"The sequence of events leading to the querying of the SCM database began with the attacker establishing control over Workstation B on April 17, 2018. This workstation had access to the SCM application. Subsequently, Workstation B was used to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. From Citrix Server 2, the attacker then began querying the SCM database using the A.A. account, starting on June 26, 2018."
What measures were taken to prevent future similar queries against the SCM database?,"After the discovery of unusual queries and the subsequent stopping of data exfiltration on July 4, 2018, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database. While the specific technical measures are not detailed, the action implies that security protocols or access controls were updated or implemented to block such unauthorized database access."
What was the outcome of implementing internet surfing separation?,"The implementation of internet surfing separation on July 20, 2018, resulted in no further signs of malicious activity being detected thereafter. This indicates that the measure was effective in preventing the attacker from maintaining command and control over any remaining footholds in the network."
