"What is the significance of ""RAT 1"" and ""RAT 2"" in the context of privilege escalation and lateral movement?","In the context of privilege escalation and lateral movement, ""RAT 1"" and ""RAT 2"" refer to malware, specifically Remote Access Trojans (RATs). RAT 1 is identified as a Remote Access Trojan. ""RAT 2"" is also a Remote Access Trojan and is the same malware referred to as RAT 1 in the report. These malware samples were found to be stealthy by design or unique variants not detected by standard anti-malware solutions, and were used by the attacker in their lateral movements across endpoints and servers."
How was malware distributed by the attacker to infect other machines?,"The attacker distributed malware to infect other machines using PowerShell commands. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives."
What was the attacker's likely compromise of the Windows authentication system?,"CSA assessed that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system. This compromise allowed the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials. With these credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, as well as all employee workstations and their underlying data within the domain."
"Describe the attacker's actions on Workstation B on April 17, 2018.","On April 17, 2018, the attacker gained access to Workstation B (SGH). Following this access, the attacker planted RAT 2, a Remote Access Trojan, thereby gaining control of the workstation. This workstation, Workstation B, had access to the SCM application. Subsequently, Workstation B was utilized by the attacker to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2."
What is the SCM database and what kind of queries were run against it?,"The SCM database is a database that the attacker began querying from Citrix Server 2 using the A.A. account starting from June 26, 2018. The attacker ran three types of SQL queries against the SCM database: reconnaissance queries on the schema of the database, direct queries relating to particular individuals, and bulk queries on patients in general."
What information was retrieved from the SCM database through SQL queries?,"Through SQL queries, the attacker was able to retrieve the following information: 1. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. 2. Demographic records of 1,495,364 patients, which included their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. 3. Outpatient dispensed medication records of approximately 159,000 of the 1,495,364 patients."
Explain the data exfiltration route shown in Figure 11.,"Figure 11 illustrates the data exfiltration route. The process begins with C2 servers, which are Command and Control servers. From these servers, data is exfiltrated. The route involves Workstation A, which communicates with Citrix Server 2. Citrix Server 2, in turn, communicates with the SCM DB Server, which is the database server. The legend indicates that a laptop icon represents a workstation, and a server icon represents a server. The purple arrows show the flow of data, with exfiltration originating from the C2 servers and moving through Workstation A and Citrix Server 2."
When and how was the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database stopped?,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped on July 4, 2018. This action was taken after staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries being run against the SCM database. They then implemented steps to prevent any similar queries from being executed against the database."
What recommendation was made by CSA after detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server?,"After detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented. The purpose of this recommendation was to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds they might have had within the network."
"When was internet surfing separation implemented, and what was the outcome?","Internet surfing separation was implemented on July 20, 2018. Following this implementation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected."
What is privilege escalation?,"Privilege escalation is a process where an attacker with limited access to a system gains higher-level permissions. This allows them to perform actions that are normally restricted, such as accessing sensitive data or installing malicious software."
What is lateral movement in cybersecurity?,"Lateral movement in cybersecurity refers to the actions an attacker takes to move through a network after gaining initial access. This involves navigating from one compromised system to others, often to find valuable data or gain higher privileges."

What characteristics did the malware samples analyzed by CSA possess?,"The malware samples found and analyzed by CSA were either tools that were stealthy by design, or unique variants that were not seen in the wild and not detected by standard anti-malware solutions."
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a compromised computer. It typically operates by appearing as a legitimate program, but secretly provides the attacker with access and control over the victim's system."
"Besides malware, what other methods did the attacker use for lateral movement?","Besides malware, the attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware and infect other machines. They also copied malicious files between machines over mapped network drives."
