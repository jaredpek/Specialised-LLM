Analyse the malware samples found and analysed by CSA with respect to their detection by standard anti-malware solutions.,"The malware samples found and analysed by CSA were either stealthy by design or unique variants. These unique variants were not seen in the wild and, consequently, were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. 'Stealthy by design' refers to malware intentionally crafted to evade detection mechanisms. 'Unique variants' are modifications of existing malware that have not been previously identified or cataloged by security software."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of the attacker's lateral movements?,"The attacker's lateral movements were evidenced by the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. This indicates that the attacker was able to move from one system to another within the network, spreading malicious software. 'Lateral movement' in cybersecurity refers to the techniques attackers use to move through a network after gaining initial access. 'Proliferation of malware' means the widespread distribution and infection of multiple systems with malicious software."
Describe the types of malware that included RAT 1 and RAT 2.,"The malware identified included RAT 1, which is a Remote Access Trojan. Another such malware was referred to in the report as 'RAT 2'. Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a victim's computer. The malware associated with an earlier-mentioned log file was also part of this group."
Explain how the attacker distributed malware to infect other machines.,"The attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware, which in turn infected other machines. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives. 'PowerShell commands' are instructions executed through the Windows PowerShell scripting language, often used for system administration and automation, but also by attackers for malicious purposes. 'Mapped network drives' are network resources that have been assigned a drive letter on a local computer, allowing for easier access to shared files and folders."
What was the assessment by CSA regarding the attacker's access to the Windows authentication system?,"CSA assessed that the attacker was likely to have compromised the Windows authentication system and obtained administrator and user credentials. This compromise would have granted the attacker significant control over the network. 'Windows authentication system' is the mechanism Windows uses to verify the identity of users and devices attempting to access resources. 'Administrator credentials' are usernames and passwords that grant high-level privileges and control over a system, while 'user credentials' refer to the login information for standard user accounts."
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications. Furthermore, the attacker had full control over all employee workstations and the underlying data within the domain. 'Hosted applications' are software programs that are run on a server and accessed by users over a network. 'Domain' in this context refers to a network of computers managed by a central authority, typically within an organization."
Describe the event of establishing control over Workstation B.,"On 17 April 2018, the attacker gained access to Workstation B (SGH) and planted RAT 2. This action resulted in the attacker gaining control of the workstation. Workstation B had access to the SCM application. 'Workstation B (SGH)' refers to a specific computer designated as 'Workstation B' located at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). 'SCM application' is a software application that Workstation B had access to."
How was Workstation B utilized by the attacker after gaining control?,"After gaining control of Workstation B, the attacker used it to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. 'Citrix Servers' are servers that provide remote access to applications and desktops, often used in enterprise environments for secure remote work."
When did the attacker begin querying the SCM database and from which server?,"From 26 June 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database. These queries were made from Citrix Server 2, using the A.A. account. 'SCM database' is a specific database that stores information related to the SCM application. 'Citrix Server 2' is a specific server within the Citrix environment. 'A.A. account' refers to a specific user account used by the attacker."
What were the three types of SQL queries the attacker ran against the SCM database?,"The attacker ran three types of SQL queries against the SCM database: (i) reconnaissance on the schema of the SCM database, (ii) direct queries relating to particular individuals, and (iii) bulk queries on patients in general. 'SQL' stands for Structured Query Language, a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. 'Schema' refers to the structure or blueprint of a database, detailing its tables, columns, and relationships. 'Reconnaissance' is the process of gathering information about a target system. 'Direct queries' are specific requests for information about individual records, while 'bulk queries' retrieve large sets of data."
What information was retrieved by the attacker from the SQL queries to the SCM database?,"From the SQL queries to the SCM database, the attacker was able to retrieve the following information: 1. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. 2. The demographic records of 1,495,364 patients, including their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. 3. The outpatient dispensed medication records of about 159,000 of the 1,495,364 patients. 'NRIC numbers' are National Registration Identity Card numbers, a unique identifier for Singaporean citizens and residents."
Describe the data exfiltration route as depicted in Figure 11.,"Figure 11 illustrates the data exfiltration route. Data was exfiltrated from the SCM DB Server to Citrix Server 2, and then to Workstation A. From Workstation A, the data was exfiltrated to C2 servers. The legend indicates that a laptop icon represents a Workstation, and a server icon represents a Server. 'Data exfiltration' is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. 'C2 servers' refer to Command and Control servers, which are used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems."
"When was the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database stopped, and how?","The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped on 4 July 2018. This occurred after staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries and took steps to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database. 'IHiS' refers to Integrated Health Information Systems, the national health informatics agency in Singapore."
What recommendation was made by CSA after the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server?,"After the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented. This measure was intended to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds in the network. 'Internet surfing separation' is a security measure that restricts or prevents users from accessing the internet from certain network segments or devices."
"When was internet surfing separation implemented, and what was the outcome?","Internet surfing separation was implemented on 20 July 2018. Following this implementation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected thereafter. 'Thereafter' means after that point in time."
Analyse the malware samples found and analysed by CSA with respect to their stealth capabilities.,"The malware samples found and analysed by CSA were either stealthy by design or unique variants. Malware that is 'stealthy by design' is intentionally created to avoid detection by security software and human analysis. This often involves techniques to hide its presence, activity, or malicious payload. 'Unique variants' are also considered stealthy as they are not recognized by existing detection signatures."
What is the significance of the attacker gaining control over employee workstations and underlying data?,"Gaining full control over all employee workstations and the underlying data within the domain signifies a critical breach of security. It means the attacker could access, modify, or delete sensitive information, impersonate users, and potentially launch further attacks from within the network. 'Underlying data' refers to all the information stored on these workstations."
Explain the role of Workstation B in the attacker's actions.,"Workstation B served as a pivot point for the attacker. After gaining control of Workstation B and planting RAT 2, the attacker used it to gain remote access to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. This allowed the attacker to move further into the network infrastructure and access more sensitive systems."
What was the purpose of the attacker's reconnaissance queries on the SCM database schema?,"The attacker's reconnaissance queries on the schema of the SCM database were aimed at understanding the structure and organization of the database. By analyzing the schema, the attacker could identify where specific types of information were stored, how tables were related, and what data fields were available, which is crucial for planning subsequent data extraction."
What types of personal information were compromised through the SQL queries?,"Through the SQL queries, the attacker was able to retrieve personal information including the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. Additionally, demographic records of 1,495,364 patients were compromised, which included their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. Outpatient dispensed medication records for approximately 159,000 patients were also accessed."
"Describe the relationship between Citrix Server 2, SCM DB Server, and Workstation A in the data exfiltration route.","In the data exfiltration route, data was first accessed from the SCM DB Server and then transferred to Citrix Server 2. From Citrix Server 2, the data moved to Workstation A. Finally, Workstation A was used to exfiltrate the data to C2 servers. This indicates a multi-hop process where data was moved through several systems before leaving the network."
What steps were taken to prevent similar queries against the SCM database after the incident was discovered?,"After the unusual queries against the SCM database were discovered, staff from IHiS took steps to prevent any similar queries from being run. While the specific steps are not detailed, these would typically involve implementing stricter access controls, modifying query permissions, or enhancing monitoring and alerting systems for database access."
What was the objective of implementing internet surfing separation?,"The objective of implementing internet surfing separation was to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds in the network. By separating internet access, it becomes more difficult for an attacker to communicate with compromised systems within the network and issue commands."
Analyse the attacker's lateral movement with respect to malware proliferation.,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. This means that as the attacker moved laterally through the network, they spread malware to multiple systems. 'Lateral movement' refers to an attacker's ability to move from one compromised system to others within a network. 'Proliferation' indicates a rapid increase or spread."
What specific types of tools were identified among the malware samples?,"Among the malware samples found and analysed by CSA, some were tools that were stealthy by design. Others were unique variants that had not been seen in the wild and were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This suggests the attacker utilized both custom or modified tools and potentially off-the-shelf malware designed for evasion."
What is the significance of malware being 'not detected by standard anti-malware solutions'?,"Malware that is 'not detected by standard anti-malware solutions' is significant because it implies the attacker used sophisticated or novel techniques that current security software could not identify. This allows the malware to operate undetected for longer periods, increasing the potential for damage and data theft. 'Standard anti-malware solutions' refer to common antivirus and endpoint detection software."
How did the attacker leverage PowerShell commands in their activities?,"The attacker leveraged PowerShell commands to distribute malware, which was used to infect other machines. PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can be used for legitimate system administration tasks, but attackers often exploit its capabilities for malicious purposes, such as deploying malware and executing commands remotely."
What were the implications of the attacker obtaining administrator and user credentials?,"The implications of the attacker obtaining administrator and user credentials were that they gained full control over the network. This included control over all Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and all underlying data within the domain. 'Administrator credentials' grant the highest level of access and control, while 'user credentials' allow access to resources based on assigned permissions."
Describe the timeline of the attacker gaining control over Workstation B and its subsequent use.,"The attacker gained control over Workstation B on 17 April 2018. After planting RAT 2 on this workstation, the attacker used it to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. This sequence of events highlights how a compromised workstation can be used as a stepping stone to access more critical infrastructure."
What was the attacker's objective when querying the SCM database?,"The attacker's objective when querying the SCM database was to retrieve sensitive information. This included personal data, medication records, and demographic information of a large number of patients. The queries were categorized into reconnaissance, direct queries for individual data, and bulk queries for general patient information."
What specific types of data were retrieved concerning the Prime Minister?,The attacker was able to retrieve the Prime Minister's personal data and outpatient medication data from the SCM database through SQL queries. This represents a highly sensitive data exfiltration targeting a prominent individual.
"How many patients' demographic records were compromised, and what information did they contain?","The demographic records of 1,495,364 patients were compromised. This information included their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. 'Demographic records' are data that describe populations or segments of populations."
What was the scale of compromised medication records?,"The outpatient dispensed medication records of about 159,000 patients were compromised. These patients were part of the larger group of 1,495,364 patients whose demographic records were also accessed."
Explain the 'Exfiltration' arrow in Figure 11.,"The 'Exfiltration' arrow in Figure 11 indicates the direction of data transfer out of the network. It shows data moving from Workstation A towards the C2 servers, signifying the unauthorized removal of data from the compromised environment. 'Exfiltration' is the process of stealing data."
What role did C2 servers play in the data exfiltration route?,"C2 servers, or Command and Control servers, served as the destination for the exfiltrated data. The data, after being processed or staged on Workstation A, was sent to these external servers, which are typically controlled by the attacker to manage compromised systems and receive stolen information."
What was the immediate cause for stopping the data exfiltration?,"The immediate cause for stopping the data exfiltration was the discovery of unusual queries against the SCM database by staff from IHiS. Upon identifying this suspicious activity, they took immediate steps to halt the process and prevent further data loss."
What actions were taken to prevent future similar incidents after the SCM database breach?,"After the incident, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database. While the specific measures are not detailed, these actions are crucial for enhancing database security and preventing recurrence of such breaches."
What was the context for CSA's recommendation regarding internet surfing separation?,"CSA's recommendation for internet surfing separation came after the detection of malware and communications originating from the S.P. server. This indicated that the attacker might still have had a presence or control within the network, and separating internet access was a preventative measure."
What is the definition of 'footholds' in the context of network security?,"In the context of network security, 'footholds' refer to any compromised systems or access points that an attacker has established within a network. These footholds allow the attacker to maintain persistence, conduct further reconnaissance, and launch additional attacks. The recommendation for internet surfing separation aimed to eliminate these potential footholds."
What was the outcome of implementing internet surfing separation?,The implementation of internet surfing separation on 20 July 2018 resulted in no further signs of malicious activity being detected thereafter. This indicates that the measure was effective in disrupting the attacker's ability to operate within the network.
Analyse the attacker's actions with respect to privilege escalation and lateral movement.,"The attacker's actions demonstrate both privilege escalation and lateral movement. Privilege escalation likely occurred when the attacker compromised the Windows authentication system to obtain administrator credentials. Lateral movement was evidenced by the proliferation of malware across endpoints and servers, and the use of compromised systems like Workstation B to access other parts of the network, such as Citrix Servers."
What is the significance of the attacker using 'unique variants' of malware?,"The use of 'unique variants' of malware is significant because it suggests the attacker was actively trying to evade detection by standard security measures. These variants are custom-made or modified versions of known malware, making them unfamiliar to signature-based detection systems. This allows the malware to remain undetected for longer periods."
How did the attacker gain initial access or establish a presence that allowed for lateral movement?,"While the initial access method is not explicitly detailed, the attacker's lateral movement was evidenced by the proliferation of malware across endpoints and servers. This suggests that once an initial foothold was established, the attacker used malware, potentially distributed via PowerShell commands or copied over network drives, to spread to other systems."
What does it mean for an attacker to 'exercise command and control'?,"To 'exercise command and control' means that an attacker can issue instructions and commands to compromised systems within a network and receive information back from them. This allows the attacker to remotely manage infected machines, deploy additional malware, and orchestrate further malicious activities. Internet surfing separation was implemented to prevent this."
What is the definition of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to remotely control a victim's computer. RATs are often disguised as legitimate software, and once installed, they allow the attacker to access files, monitor user activity, execute commands, and perform other actions on the compromised system without the user's knowledge."
Describe the attacker's progression from gaining control of Workstation B to accessing SCM database.,"The attacker first gained control of Workstation B and planted RAT 2. From Workstation B, the attacker logged in remotely to SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. Subsequently, from Citrix Server 2, the attacker began querying the SCM database, indicating a progression from endpoint compromise to server access and then to database interaction."
What is the difference between reconnaissance queries and direct queries on a database?,"Reconnaissance queries on a database, such as those targeting the schema, are used to understand the database's structure, tables, and fields. Direct queries, on the other hand, are used to retrieve specific data related to particular individuals or records. The attacker used reconnaissance to plan their data extraction and direct queries to obtain specific sensitive information."
What is the significance of the attacker accessing medication records?,"Accessing medication records is significant because it involves highly sensitive personal health information. This data can be used for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, blackmail, or targeted phishing attacks. The compromise of approximately 159,000 patients' medication records represents a substantial breach of privacy."
How does the data exfiltration route illustrate a multi-stage attack?,"The data exfiltration route illustrates a multi-stage attack by showing data moving sequentially through multiple systems: SCM DB Server -> Citrix Server 2 -> Workstation A -> C2 servers. Each hop represents a stage where the attacker potentially used different tools or techniques to move the data, making it harder to trace and disrupt."
What is the role of IHiS in the context of the SingHealth Cyber Breach?,"IHiS, or Integrated Health Information Systems, played a crucial role in detecting and responding to the SCM database breach. Staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries and took the necessary steps to stop the data exfiltration and prevent future similar incidents. This highlights the importance of internal security monitoring."
