Analyse the proliferation of malware with respect to its impact on endpoints and servers.,"The proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers provided evidence of the attacker's lateral movements. This malware included tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants not previously seen and not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. These malware samples included RAT 1, a Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 2"", and other malware associated with a specific log file."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of malware samples found and analyzed by CSA?,"The malware samples found and analyzed by CSA were either designed to be stealthy or were unique variants that had not been previously observed in the wild. Crucially, these samples were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This indicates a sophisticated attack that bypassed conventional security measures. The malware included RAT 1, a Remote Access Trojan also referred to as ""RAT 2"", and other malicious software linked to a specific log file."
Explain the role of PowerShell commands in the attacker's actions.,"PowerShell commands were used by the attacker to distribute malware and infect other machines. Additionally, these commands facilitated the copying of malicious files between machines over mapped network drives. This demonstrates the attacker's utilization of legitimate system tools for malicious purposes, enabling lateral movement and further compromise of the network."
Describe the implications of the attacker compromising the Windows authentication system.,"The attacker's compromise of the Windows authentication system led to the acquisition of administrator and user credentials. This compromise meant that the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications, as well as all employee workstations and the underlying data within the domain. This level of access allowed for extensive data exfiltration and system manipulation."
Detail the attacker's actions on Workstation B on 17 April 2018.,"On 17 April 2018, the attacker gained access to Workstation B (SGH). Following this access, the attacker planted RAT 2, thereby gaining control of the workstation. This workstation, Workstation B, had access to the SCM application. Subsequently, Workstation B was utilized by the attacker to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2."
What was the significance of Workstation B in the attacker's operations?,"Workstation B served as a critical pivot point for the attacker. After gaining control of Workstation B and planting RAT 2, the attacker used it to access the SCM application. Furthermore, Workstation B was used to establish remote login access to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2, facilitating further lateral movement and access to sensitive systems."
Describe the attacker's activities related to the SCM database from 26 June to 4 July 2018.,"From 26 June 2018, the attacker began querying the SCM database from Citrix Server 2, using the A.A. account. The attacker ran three types of SQL queries: reconnaissance queries on the schema of the SCM database, direct queries related to particular individuals, and bulk queries concerning patients in general. The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were eventually stopped on 4 July 2018."
What types of SQL queries did the attacker execute against the SCM database?,"The attacker executed three distinct types of SQL queries against the SCM database. These included: (i) reconnaissance queries aimed at understanding the schema of the SCM database, (ii) direct queries focused on retrieving information about particular individuals, and (iii) bulk queries designed to gather data on patients in general."
What information was retrieved by the attacker from the SCM database via SQL queries?,"Through SQL queries, the attacker was able to retrieve significant amounts of sensitive information. This included the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. Additionally, the attacker retrieved demographic records for 1,495,364 patients, encompassing their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. They also obtained outpatient dispensed medication records for approximately 159,000 of these patients."
Analyse the data exfiltration route used by the attacker.,"The data exfiltration route involved the attacker accessing the SCM DB Server, likely through Citrix Server 2. From Citrix Server 2, data was then transferred to Workstation A. Finally, the exfiltrated data was sent from Workstation A to C2 servers, indicating a multi-stage process for data extraction from the compromised network."
Explain the process by which data exfiltration from the SCM database was stopped.,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were halted on 4 July 2018. This cessation occurred after staff from IHiS identified unusual queries being run against the database. Following this discovery, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being executed against the SCM database in the future."
What actions were recommended by CSA after detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server?,"Following the detection of malware and communications originating from the S.P. server, CSA recommended the implementation of internet surfing separation. This measure was intended to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds they might have retained within the network."
"When was internet surfing separation implemented, and what was its effect?","Internet surfing separation was implemented on 20 July 2018. After this implementation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected. This indicates that the measure was effective in disrupting the attacker's ability to maintain command and control or to conduct further malicious operations within the SingHealth network."
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to remotely control a compromised computer. It allows the attacker to perform various actions, such as accessing files, running programs, and monitoring user activity, without the user's knowledge or consent. In this context, RAT 1 and RAT 2 are examples of such Trojans used by the attacker."
Define 'stealthy by design' in the context of malware.,"In the context of malware, 'stealthy by design' refers to malware that is intentionally engineered to evade detection by security software and human analysis. This can involve techniques such as code obfuscation, process injection, or the use of rootkit functionalities to hide its presence and activities on a compromised system. The malware samples found were designed to be stealthy, making them difficult to identify and remove."
What are 'unique variants' of malware?,"Unique variants of malware refer to modified or customized versions of existing malware families that have not been previously identified or cataloged by security researchers. Attackers often create unique variants to bypass signature-based detection systems used by anti-malware software. The malware samples analyzed were unique variants, meaning they were not recognized by standard detection methods."
Explain the term 'in-the-wild' as it relates to malware.,"The term 'in-the-wild' when used in relation to malware refers to malware that is actively being used in real-world attacks and has been observed in the wild by security professionals. Malware that is not yet 'in-the-wild' might be in development, testing, or has not yet been deployed in actual attacks. The malware samples analyzed were not seen 'in-the-wild', suggesting they were either new or specifically tailored for this attack."
What are 'standard anti-malware solutions'?,"Standard anti-malware solutions are common security software programs designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) from computer systems. These solutions typically rely on signature databases of known malware, heuristic analysis to identify suspicious behavior, and other detection techniques. The malware used in this incident was not detected by these standard solutions, highlighting its advanced nature."
What is meant by 'lateral movements' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, 'lateral movements' refer to the actions an attacker takes to move from one compromised system to another within a network. After gaining initial access to a system, attackers often attempt to spread across the network to access more valuable data or systems, escalate their privileges, and establish persistence. The proliferation of malware across endpoints and servers was evidence of the attacker's lateral movements."
Define 'endpoints' and 'servers' in the context of a network.,"In a network context, 'endpoints' typically refer to devices that are used by end-users, such as workstations, laptops, and mobile devices. 'Servers' are more powerful computers that provide services or resources to other devices on the network, such as file servers, web servers, or database servers. The attacker's malware spread across both endpoints and servers."
What is the 'Windows authentication system'?,"The Windows authentication system is a core component of Microsoft Windows operating systems responsible for verifying the identity of users and devices attempting to access network resources. It manages user accounts, passwords, and security tokens to ensure that only authorized individuals and systems can gain access. The attacker compromised this system to obtain credentials."
What are 'administrator credentials' and 'user credentials'?,"'Administrator credentials' refer to the username and password (or other authentication factors) that grant a user the highest level of control and privileges on a computer system or network. 'User credentials' are the login details for standard user accounts, which have more limited permissions. The attacker obtained both types of credentials by compromising the Windows authentication system."
Explain the concept of 'full control' over a network.,"'Full control' over a network implies that an attacker has the ability to perform any action on any system within that network without restriction. This includes accessing, modifying, or deleting data, installing or removing software, reconfiguring systems, and potentially disrupting operations. The attacker's acquisition of administrator and user credentials granted them full control."
What are 'hosted applications' in a network environment?,"'Hosted applications' are software programs that are installed and run on servers within a network, rather than directly on individual user workstations. These applications are often accessed remotely by users. The attacker gained full control over these hosted applications, meaning they could manipulate or access them as they pleased."
Define 'employee workstations' in a corporate network.,"'Employee workstations' are the computers assigned to individual employees within an organization for their daily work. These devices are connected to the corporate network and are used to access company resources and applications. The attacker's compromise extended to all employee workstations, giving them access to data stored on these machines."
What is meant by 'underlying data' within a domain?,"'Underlying data' within a domain refers to all the information stored on the servers, workstations, and other systems within that network domain. This can include sensitive company records, customer information, financial data, intellectual property, and any other digital assets. The attacker's full control allowed them to access and potentially compromise this data."
What is a 'domain' in the context of computer networks?,"In the context of computer networks, a 'domain' is a logical grouping of computers and devices that share a common security policy and administration. In Windows environments, this is typically managed by Active Directory. The attacker gained control over the entire domain, meaning all resources and systems within that defined boundary were under their influence."
Describe the significance of gaining control over 'Workstation B' on 17 April 2018.,"Gaining control over Workstation B on 17 April 2018 was a significant step for the attacker. It allowed them to plant RAT 2, a Remote Access Trojan, which provided them with administrative control over the workstation. Crucially, Workstation B had access to the SCM application, and was subsequently used to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2, enabling further network penetration."
What is the 'SCM application' and why was access to it important?,"The SCM application is a system that the attacker gained access to via Workstation B. While the specific function of the SCM application is not detailed, its importance is highlighted by the fact that the attacker's control of Workstation B provided them with access to it. This access was a precursor to their ability to query the SCM database."
Explain the function of 'Citrix Servers' in this scenario.,"Citrix Servers are used to provide remote access to applications and desktops. In this incident, Workstation B was used to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. These servers likely provided access to other internal resources or applications, including the SCM database, which the attacker subsequently queried."
What is the 'SCM database'?,"The SCM database is a data repository that the attacker began querying from 26 June 2018. Access to this database was gained via Citrix Server 2 using the A.A. account. The database contained sensitive patient information, including personal details and medication records, which the attacker exfiltrated."
What is an 'A.A. account' in the context of database access?,"An 'A.A. account' refers to a specific user account used by the attacker to access the SCM database via Citrix Server 2. The nature of this account (e.g., whether it was a legitimate compromised account or a specially created one) is not specified, but it was the credential used to initiate the database queries and data exfiltration."
Define 'reconnaissance' in the context of cybersecurity queries.,"In cybersecurity, 'reconnaissance' refers to the initial phase of an attack where the attacker gathers information about the target system or network. In the context of SQL queries, reconnaissance on the schema of the SCM database means the attacker was trying to understand the structure, tables, and relationships within the database to identify valuable data and plan further attacks."
What are 'direct queries relating to particular individuals'?,"'Direct queries relating to particular individuals' are specific SQL commands that target and retrieve information about individual patients within the SCM database. Instead of broad data sweeps, these queries were designed to extract data pertaining to specific people, indicating a targeted approach to data collection."
Explain 'bulk queries on patients in general'.,"'Bulk queries on patients in general' refer to SQL commands that retrieve large volumes of data pertaining to many patients simultaneously, without necessarily targeting specific individuals. This type of query is often used to gather broad datasets, such as all patient medication records or demographic information, for further analysis or exfiltration."
What are 'demographic records'?,"'Demographic records' are collections of data that describe the characteristics of a population. In this context, for the 1,495,364 patients, these records included their names, NRIC numbers (a national identification number), addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. This information is considered personally identifiable information (PII)."
What is 'outpatient dispensed medication data'?,"'Outpatient dispensed medication data' refers to records detailing the medications prescribed and dispensed to patients who receive medical care without being admitted to a hospital. This data includes information about the specific drugs, dosages, and dates of dispensing. The attacker exfiltrated such records for a significant number of patients."
Describe the 'data exfiltration route' shown in Figure 11.,"Figure 11 illustrates the data exfiltration route. Data was accessed from the SCM DB Server and transferred to Citrix Server 2. From Citrix Server 2, the data moved to Workstation A. Finally, the exfiltrated data was sent from Workstation A to C2 servers, indicating the path the stolen information took out of the network."
What are 'C2 servers'?,"'C2 servers' (Command and Control servers) are remote servers that attackers use to communicate with compromised systems. These servers allow attackers to send commands to the infected machines, receive stolen data, and manage their botnet or attack infrastructure. In the data exfiltration route, C2 servers were the final destination for the stolen data."
What actions were taken to stop the data exfiltration from the SCM database?,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were stopped on 4 July 2018. This was achieved after staff from IHiS identified unusual queries being executed against the database. Following this discovery, IHiS implemented measures to prevent any similar unauthorized queries from being run against the SCM database in the future."
Who are 'IHiS' and what role did they play in stopping the data exfiltration?,"IHiS (Integrated Health Information Systems) is an organization whose staff played a crucial role in stopping the data exfiltration. They discovered the unusual queries targeting the SCM database, which led to the cessation of data copying and exfiltration on 4 July 2018. They also took steps to prevent future similar incidents."
What is 'internet surfing separation'?,"'Internet surfing separation' is a security measure implemented to restrict or block internet access from specific systems or networks. In this context, it was recommended to prevent the attacker from using the internet to maintain command and control over any compromised systems or footholds within the SingHealth network."
What was the outcome of implementing internet surfing separation on 20 July 2018?,"The implementation of internet surfing separation on 20 July 2018 had a significant positive outcome. After this measure was put in place, no further signs of malicious activity were detected within the SingHealth network. This suggests that the separation effectively disrupted the attacker's ability to operate and communicate."
What is the significance of the period 'December 2017 to June 2018' in relation to privilege escalation and lateral movement?,"The period from December 2017 to June 2018 marks the timeframe during which the attacker engaged in significant activities related to privilege escalation and lateral movement within the SingHealth network. This period saw the proliferation of malware, compromise of authentication systems, and the eventual querying of the SCM database, all indicative of these advanced attack techniques."
What is 'privilege escalation' in cybersecurity?,"Privilege escalation is a type of cyberattack where an attacker, after gaining initial access to a system, exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to obtain a higher level of access or permissions. This allows them to perform actions that are normally restricted to privileged users, such as administrators. The attacker's actions in this incident involved privilege escalation to gain broader control."
How did the attacker demonstrate privilege escalation?,"The attacker demonstrated privilege escalation by first gaining access to Workstation B and then compromising the Windows authentication system to obtain administrator and user credentials. This allowed them to gain full control over servers, applications, and workstations, indicating a significant elevation of their initial access privileges."
What is the relationship between malware proliferation and lateral movement?,"Malware proliferation across multiple endpoints and servers is a direct indicator and method of lateral movement. By spreading malware, an attacker can establish a presence on numerous systems within a network, allowing them to move from one compromised machine to another, explore the network, and reach their ultimate objectives. The evidence found in the proliferation of malware confirmed the attacker's lateral movements."
What was the attacker's objective in querying the SCM database?,"The attacker's objective in querying the SCM database was to retrieve sensitive patient information. This included personal details, NRIC numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and medication records. This data was then exfiltrated, suggesting the objective was likely data theft for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or fraud."
What does 'no further signs of malicious activity were detected thereafter' imply?,"The statement 'no further signs of malicious activity were detected thereafter' implies that the security measures implemented, specifically the internet surfing separation on 20 July 2018, were successful in neutralizing the threat. It suggests that the attacker was no longer able to operate within the SingHealth network after these measures were put in place."
