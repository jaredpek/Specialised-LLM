Define the concept of privilege escalation and lateral movement in the context of cybersecurity.,"Privilege escalation refers to the act of exploiting a vulnerability in a system to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement is the process by which an attacker, after gaining initial access to a system, moves to other systems within the network to achieve their objectives. This movement often involves exploiting vulnerabilities or using compromised credentials to access additional systems and data."
Describe the evidence found regarding the attacker's lateral movements.,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. Malware samples analyzed were either stealthy by design or unique variants not seen in the wild and not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. This malware included RAT 1, identified as a Remote Access Trojan, and referred to as ""RAT 2"" in the report, along with malware associated with a specific log file."
What types of malware were identified during the attacker's lateral movements?,"The malware identified during the attacker's lateral movements included RAT 1, which is a Remote Access Trojan. This was also referred to as ""RAT 2"" in the report. Additionally, malware associated with an earlier-mentioned log file was also found."
