It served as a command-line shell and scripting language that enabled the attacker to automate and execute commands for spreading malicious software across the network."
What are mapped network drives?,"Mapped network drives are network resources, such as shared folders on other computers or servers, that are assigned a drive letter on a user's local computer. This makes them appear as if they are local drives, allowing users to access files and folders on the network as easily as they would access files on their own computer. In the context of the attack, the attacker used mapped network drives to copy malicious files between machines."
What is the Windows authentication system?,"The Windows authentication system is a security mechanism used in Microsoft Windows operating systems to verify the identity of users and devices attempting to access network resources. It typically involves user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, and can also include other authentication factors. Compromising this system allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts and administrative privileges."
What are administrator and user credentials?,"Administrator credentials refer to the username and password combination that grants full control over a computer system or network. User credentials refer to the username and password combination that allows a user to access specific resources or perform limited actions on a system. In the context of the attack, obtaining these credentials allowed the attacker to gain elevated privileges and control."
What is a domain in a computer network?,"A domain, in the context of computer networking, is a logical grouping of computers, users, and other resources that are managed by a central authority, typically a domain controller. It defines a security boundary and allows for centralized administration and policy enforcement. Within a domain, users and computers share a common directory database and security policies."
What is the SCM application mentioned in relation to Workstation B?,"The SCM application is an application that the attacker gained access to after compromising Workstation B. The document does not provide further details about the specific functionality or purpose of the SCM application itself, only that it was accessible via Workstation B."
What are SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2?,"SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2 are servers within the SingHealth (SGH) network that utilize Citrix technology. Citrix is a company that provides virtualization, networking, and cloud computing technologies. These servers were likely used to host applications or provide remote access to resources, and the attacker used Workstation B to log in remotely to them."
What is a database schema?,"A database schema is the blueprint or structure of a database. It defines the organization of data, including tables, columns, data types, relationships between tables, and constraints. Reconnaissance on the schema helps an attacker understand how the data is organized and identify potential targets for exploitation."
What is the purpose of reconnaissance queries in a database attack?,"Reconnaissance queries are used by attackers to gather information about the structure and contents of a database. By querying the schema, an attacker can understand how the data is organized, identify sensitive tables or columns, and plan their subsequent actions, such as data extraction or manipulation."
What is the significance of the A.A. account used to query the SCM database?,"The A.A. account was the specific user account used by the attacker to query the SCM database from Citrix Server 2. The use of a particular account, especially if it has elevated privileges, is significant as it indicates the attacker's access level and the method they employed to interact with the database."
What are demographic records?,"Demographic records are collections of data that describe the characteristics of a population. In the context of the SCM database, these records included personal information about patients such as their names, NRIC numbers (National Registration Identity Card numbers, likely in Singapore), addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. This type of information is considered sensitive personal data."
What kind of medication data was retrieved by the attacker?,"The attacker retrieved two types of medication data: the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data, and the outpatient dispensed medication records for a significant number of patients (about 159,000)."
What is data exfiltration?,"Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network to an external location. In the context of a cyberattack, it refers to the process by which an attacker steals sensitive information after gaining access to a system. This can involve copying files, extracting data from databases, or sending sensitive information over the internet."
What is a C2 server?,"A C2 server, short for Command and Control server, is a computer used by attackers to remotely communicate with and control compromised systems (bots or malware) within a target network. It serves as the central hub for issuing commands to the infected machines and receiving data from them. In the provided diagram, C2 servers are shown as part of the exfiltration route, suggesting they are involved in the communication channel for data transfer."
What is the role of Workstation A in the data exfiltration route?,"In the data exfiltration route depicted, Workstation A is shown as a point from which exfiltration occurs. It is connected to Citrix Server 2, and an arrow indicates exfiltration originating from it, potentially facilitated by C2 servers. This suggests Workstation A was used as a staging point or an active component in the process of sending data out of the network."
"What is IHiS, and what role did its staff play in stopping the attack?","IHiS (Integrated Health Information Systems) is likely an IT department or organization responsible for managing health information systems. Staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries being run against the SCM database. Their discovery led to the stopping of the data copying and exfiltration on July 4, 2018, and they took steps to prevent similar future incidents."
What is command and control (C2) in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, command and control (C2) refers to the communication infrastructure and methods used by attackers to remotely manage and direct compromised systems or malware. This allows attackers to issue commands, download additional malicious payloads, and exfiltrate data from the victim's network. Preventing C2 communication is a key objective in defending against cyberattacks."
What is a network foothold?,"A network foothold, in cybersecurity, refers to a point of entry or a persistent presence that an attacker establishes within a compromised network. This foothold allows the attacker to maintain access, conduct further reconnaissance, and launch subsequent attacks, even if initial access methods are detected or blocked. The recommendation for internet surfing separation aimed to remove any such remaining footholds."
What is internet surfing separation?,"Internet surfing separation is a security measure implemented to restrict or control internet access for specific systems or users within a network. In this context, it was recommended to prevent attackers from using internet connectivity to exercise command and control over compromised systems. By separating internet access, the attacker's ability to communicate with their C2 servers or receive instructions is significantly hindered."
What was the timeframe of the privilege escalation and lateral movement activities described?,The timeframe for the privilege escalation and lateral movement activities described was from December 2017 to June 2018.
What evidence was found regarding the attacker's lateral movements?,Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. This proliferation indicated the attacker's ability to move from one system to another within the network.
What characterized the malware samples analyzed by CSA?,"The malware samples analyzed by CSA were characterized as either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants. Crucially, these malware samples were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions, making them difficult to identify and remove."
What is the definition of an endpoint in a computer network?,"An endpoint in a computer network refers to any device that connects to the network and can send or receive data. This typically includes computers, laptops, servers, mobile devices, and other network-connected hardware. In the context of the attack, the proliferation of malware across endpoints signifies the attacker's spread within the network."
How did the attacker gain control over Workstation B?,"The attacker gained control over Workstation B by first gaining access to it and then planting RAT 2, a type of malware, on the workstation. This action allowed them to establish control over the workstation."
What was the attacker's objective in querying the SCM database?,"The attacker's objective in querying the SCM database was to retrieve sensitive patient information. This included personal data, demographic records, and medication history, which they then exfiltrated from the network."
What is the significance of the attacker using the A.A. account to query the SCM database?,"The significance of the attacker using the A.A. account to query the SCM database lies in the fact that it was the specific credential used to access and extract sensitive data. If the A.A. account had elevated privileges, it would explain how the attacker was able to perform extensive queries and retrieve large amounts of data."
What types of personal information were included in the demographic records retrieved?,"The demographic records retrieved by the attacker included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth of 1,495,364 patients."
What was the total number of patients whose medication records were accessed?,"The attacker accessed the outpatient dispensed medication records of about 159,000 patients. These patients were part of the larger group of 1,495,364 patients whose demographic records were also retrieved."
What is the function of a database server?,"A database server is a computer system that stores and manages databases. It is responsible for handling requests from clients (applications or users) to access, modify, or retrieve data from the database. In the context of the attack, the SCM DB Server was the target from which the attacker extracted sensitive information."
What steps were taken to prevent similar queries against the SCM database after the attack?,"After the unusual queries were discovered, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database. This implies that security measures were enhanced or implemented to detect and block unauthorized or suspicious database access attempts."
What was the outcome of implementing internet surfing separation?,The implementation of internet surfing separation resulted in no further signs of malicious activity being detected thereafter. This indicates that the measure was effective in disrupting the attacker's ability to maintain command and control and conduct further malicious operations.
What is the definition of anti-malware solutions?,"Anti-malware solutions are software programs designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) from computer systems. Examples include antivirus software, anti-spyware, and firewalls. The document notes that the malware used in the attack was not detected by standard anti-malware solutions, highlighting its sophisticated nature."
What does it mean for malware to be 'stealthy by design'?,"Malware that is 'stealthy by design' is intentionally created with features that allow it to evade detection by security software and hide its presence on a compromised system. This can involve techniques like encrypting its code, modifying its behavior to mimic legitimate processes, or avoiding actions that would trigger security alerts."
What is the primary goal of privilege escalation for an attacker?,"The primary goal of privilege escalation for an attacker is to gain higher-level access and control over a system or network than they initially obtained. This allows them to perform more damaging actions, such as accessing sensitive data, installing further malware, disabling security controls, or moving laterally to compromise other systems."
