Define the concept of privilege escalation and lateral movement in the context of cybersecurity.,"Privilege escalation refers to the act of exploiting a vulnerability in a system to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. Lateral movement is the process by which an attacker, after gaining initial access to a system, moves to other systems within the network to access sensitive data or achieve their objectives. This movement often involves exploiting vulnerabilities or using compromised credentials to traverse the network."
Describe the evidence found regarding the attacker's lateral movements.,"Evidence of the attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers. Malware samples analyzed were either stealthy by design or unique variants not seen in the wild and undetected by standard anti-malware solutions. This malware included RAT 1, another Remote Access Trojan referred to as \""RAT 2\"", and malware associated with a specific log file."
What types of malware were identified during the attacker's lateral movements?,"The malware samples identified during the attacker's lateral movements were either tools that were stealthy by design or unique variants that were not seen in the wild. These were not detected by standard anti-malware solutions. Specifically, the malware included RAT 1, which is a Remote Access Trojan, and another variant referred to as \""RAT 2\"". Malware associated with an earlier-mentioned log file was also identified."
Explain the role of RAT 1 and RAT 2 in the context of the attacker's activities.,"RAT 1 is identified as a Remote Access Trojan. Another variant, referred to as \""RAT 2\"", was also involved in the attacker's activities. These malware types were part of the proliferation of malicious software used by the attacker to move laterally across endpoints and servers within the network."
How did the attacker distribute malware to infect other machines?,"The attacker used PowerShell commands to distribute malware, which was then used to infect other machines. Additionally, malicious files were copied between machines over mapped network drives, facilitating the spread of the malware."
What was the attacker's likely compromise of the Windows authentication system?,"CSA assessed that the attacker likely compromised the Windows authentication system. This compromise allowed the attacker to obtain administrator and user credentials, which would have granted them full control over Windows-based servers, hosted applications, employee workstations, and underlying data within the domain."
What level of control did the attacker gain after compromising the Windows authentication system?,"After compromising the Windows authentication system and obtaining administrator and user credentials, the attacker gained full control over all Windows-based servers and hosted applications. They also gained full control over all employee workstations and the underlying data within the domain."
Describe the incident of establishing control over Workstation B.,"On 17 April 2018, the attacker gained access to Workstation B (SGH). Following this access, they planted RAT 2, thereby gaining control of the workstation. This workstation subsequently had access to the SCM application."
What was the significance of Workstation B having access to the SCM application?,"Workstation B, after being compromised by the attacker and having RAT 2 planted on it, had access to the SCM application. This access was significant because it provided a pathway for the attacker to interact with or potentially exploit the SCM database."
How was Workstation B utilized by the attacker after gaining control?,"After gaining control of Workstation B, the attacker used it to log in remotely to the SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2. This action allowed the attacker to expand their reach within the network and access further resources."
"When did the attacker begin querying the SCM database, and from which server?",The attacker began querying the SCM database from Citrix Server 2 on 26 June 2018. The queries were made using the A.A. account.
What are the three types of SQL queries the attacker ran against the SCM database?,"The attacker ran three types of SQL queries against the SCM database: (i) reconnaissance on the schema of the SCM database, (ii) direct queries relating to particular individuals, and (iii) bulk queries on patients in general."
Define 'SQL queries' in the context of database interaction.,"SQL (Structured Query Language) queries are commands used to interact with and retrieve data from relational databases. In this context, the attacker used SQL queries to probe the SCM database, gather information about its structure, target specific individuals, and extract general patient data."
What information was retrieved by the attacker from the SCM database using SQL queries?,"The attacker was able to retrieve several types of sensitive information from the SCM database. This included the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. They also retrieved demographic records of 1,495,364 patients, which included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth. Additionally, outpatient dispensed medication records for approximately 159,000 of these patients were retrieved."
Specify the demographic information retrieved by the attacker.,"The attacker retrieved demographic records for 1,495,364 patients. This information included their names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth."
What medication-related data was exfiltrated by the attacker?,"The attacker exfiltrated the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data. They also retrieved the outpatient dispensed medication records of about 159,000 patients."
Describe the data exfiltration route as depicted in Figure 11.,"Figure 11 illustrates the data exfiltration route. Data was exfiltrated from the SCM DB Server, processed through Citrix Server 2, and then moved to Workstation A. From Workstation A, the data was exfiltrated to C2 servers, indicating a command and control infrastructure used by the attacker."
What is the role of Citrix Server 2 in the data exfiltration route?,"In the data exfiltration route, Citrix Server 2 acts as an intermediary. Data from the SCM DB Server is accessed via Citrix Server 2, and then transferred to Workstation A, from where it is exfiltrated to the C2 servers."
What is the function of Workstation A in the data exfiltration process?,"Workstation A serves as a staging point for data exfiltration. Data is transferred from Citrix Server 2 to Workstation A, and then from Workstation A, it is exfiltrated to the C2 servers, indicating its role in the final stage of data theft."
What are C2 servers in the context of cybersecurity attacks?,"C2 servers, short for Command and Control servers, are part of the infrastructure used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems. They are used to send commands to malware on infected machines and to receive stolen data. In the depicted data exfiltration route, C2 servers are the final destination for the exfiltrated data."
"When was the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database stopped, and why?",The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped on 4 July 2018. This occurred after staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries being run against the database and took steps to prevent any similar queries from being executed.
"Who discovered the unusual queries against the SCM database, and what action was taken?","Staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries against the SCM database. Following this discovery, they took steps to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database, which led to the stopping of data copying and exfiltration."
What recommendation was made by CSA after detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server?,"After detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented. This measure was intended to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds they might have within the network."

Following its implementation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected thereafter, indicating the effectiveness of this security measure in preventing further attacks."
What was the outcome after the implementation of internet surfing separation?,"After the implementation of internet surfing separation on 20 July 2018, no further signs of malicious activity were detected. This suggests that the measure was successful in disrupting the attacker's ability to operate within the network."
What is the timeframe covered by the report on privilege escalation and lateral movement?,The report on privilege escalation and lateral movement covers the period from December 2017 to June 2018.
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to remotely control a victim's computer. It typically operates by appearing as a legitimate program, but once installed, it allows the attacker to execute commands, access files, and monitor the user's activity without their knowledge or consent."
What does CSA stand for in the context of the document?,"CSA, in the context of this document, refers to the Cyber Security Agency. It is an entity that analyzed malware samples and made recommendations regarding security measures."
What is the significance of 'in-the-wild' when describing malware variants?,"'In-the-wild' refers to malware that is actively being used in real-world attacks and has been observed in the wild by security researchers. Malware variants that are not seen 'in-the-wild' might be new, custom-developed, or not yet widely deployed, making them potentially harder for standard security solutions to detect."
Explain the concept of 'footholds' in a network security context.,"In network security, a 'foothold' refers to a point of entry or a compromised system within a network that an attacker has gained access to. Attackers use these footholds as a base to launch further attacks, move laterally, or maintain persistence within the network."
What is the purpose of command and control (C2) in cyberattacks?,"Command and control (C2) in cyberattacks refers to the communication channel established between an attacker's infrastructure (C2 servers) and the malware or compromised systems within the victim's network. This channel allows the attacker to issue commands, manage infected systems, and exfiltrate data."
"What is the SCM database, and why was it targeted?","The SCM database appears to be a critical database within the SingHealth network, likely containing sensitive patient information. It was targeted by the attacker because it held valuable data, including personal and medication records, which the attacker sought to exfiltrate."
What is the role of the A.A. account in the SCM database queries?,"The A.A. account was used by the attacker to query the SCM database from Citrix Server 2. This suggests that the attacker had compromised or gained access to this specific account, which then allowed them to interact with the database."
What is the 'schema' of a database?,"The 'schema' of a database refers to its logical structure, including the organization of tables, the relationships between them, and the data types of the fields. Reconnaissance on the schema allows an attacker to understand how the data is organized and identify potential targets or vulnerabilities."
What are 'demographic records' in the context of patient data?,"Demographic records, in the context of patient data, include basic identifying information about individuals. This typically encompasses details such as names, NRIC numbers (National Registration Identity Card numbers, likely in Singapore), addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth."
What is the significance of retrieving 'outpatient dispensed medication records'?,"Retrieving outpatient dispensed medication records provides insight into the specific medications a patient has been prescribed and received. This information can be highly sensitive and valuable for various malicious purposes, including identity theft, fraud, or targeted social engineering."
What is the 'SingHealth Cyber Breach' mentioned in the document?,"The 'SingHealth Cyber Breach' refers to the cybersecurity incident that occurred within the SingHealth network, involving privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration by an attacker between December 2017 and July 2018."
What is the timeframe of the queries made to the SCM database?,The queries made to the SCM database by the attacker occurred from 26 June 2018 to 4 July 2018.
What is the purpose of reconnaissance queries on a database schema?,"Reconnaissance queries on a database schema are performed by attackers to understand the structure and organization of the database. This knowledge helps them identify where sensitive data is stored, how different data elements are related, and potential methods for extracting or manipulating the data."
What does it mean for an attacker to gain 'full control' over servers and workstations?,"Gaining 'full control' over servers and workstations means the attacker has the highest level of administrative privileges. They can install or remove software, modify system settings, access all files, create or delete user accounts, and essentially operate the systems as if they were the legitimate administrator, without any restrictions."
What is the role of mapped network drives in malware distribution?,"Mapped network drives are shared folders on a network that appear as local drives to a user. Attackers can copy malicious files to these mapped drives, allowing them to spread malware to other connected systems without needing direct access to each individual machine."
What is the significance of an attacker obtaining 'administrator and user credentials'?,"Obtaining administrator and user credentials is a critical step for an attacker. Administrator credentials grant the highest level of access and control over a system or network. User credentials allow access to specific resources and data that the user is authorized to access. Together, they enable extensive compromise and lateral movement."
What is the 'SCM application' mentioned in relation to Workstation B?,"The 'SCM application' is an application that Workstation B had access to. Given the context of the SCM database being queried, it is highly probable that the SCM application is the interface or system used to interact with the SCM database."
What is the purpose of 'remote login' to servers?,"Remote login allows authorized users to access and control a computer or server from a different location over a network. In this case, the attacker used Workstation B to remotely log in to SGH Citrix Servers 1 and 2, extending their access and control beyond the initially compromised workstation."
What is the difference between reconnaissance queries and direct queries?,"Reconnaissance queries are used to explore and understand the structure and contents of a database (e.g., its schema). Direct queries, on the other hand, are used to retrieve specific pieces of information, such as data related to particular individuals, based on the knowledge gained during reconnaissance."
What are 'bulk queries' in the context of database access?,"'Bulk queries' refer to requests made to retrieve a large volume of data, often without specific targeting. In this case, the attacker ran bulk queries on patients in general, likely to extract a broad dataset of patient information rather than focusing on individuals."
What is the 'data exfiltration route'?,The 'data exfiltration route' describes the path that stolen data takes from the compromised system to the attacker's control. It outlines the sequence of systems and network segments involved in the process of transferring sensitive information out of the victim's network.
What steps were taken to prevent similar queries against the SCM database after the breach was discovered?,"After the unusual queries were discovered, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database. While the exact technical steps are not detailed, this implies implementing stricter access controls, query filtering, or other security measures to block unauthorized or suspicious database access."
What is the significance of 'no further signs of malicious activity' being detected?,The detection of 'no further signs of malicious activity' after the implementation of internet surfing separation indicates that the security measures taken were effective in stopping the attacker's operations and preventing them from re-establishing control or continuing their malicious actions within the network.
