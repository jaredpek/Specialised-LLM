What is the goal of confidentiality in computer security?,"The goal of **confidentiality** is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This means ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot access or view sensitive information during transmission or when it is stored. **Confidentiality** refers to the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. A **transient communication** is data being transmitted or exchanged between parties. **Temporary storage** refers to data held in memory or caches for short durations, while **persistent storage** refers to data stored on non-volatile media like hard drives or databases for long-term retention. To keep something **secret** means to protect it from unauthorized disclosure."
Define confidentiality.,"**Confidentiality** is a security objective aimed at keeping the contents of a transient communication or data stored on either temporary or persistent storage secret. Its primary purpose is to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. More specifically, **confidentiality** is the principle of ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. A **transient communication** is the exchange of data that is not permanently stored. **Temporary storage** holds data for a limited time, typically during processing, whereas **persistent storage** retains data even after power is removed, such as on hard drives. To keep something **secret** means it is protected from being known or seen by others."
What types of data does confidentiality aim to protect?,"**Confidentiality** aims to protect the contents of a **transient communication** and data residing on **temporary** or **persistent storage**. A **transient communication** refers to data actively being sent or received. **Temporary storage** is volatile storage typically used for short-term operations, while **persistent storage** is non-volatile data storage that retains information over extended periods. This encompasses data both in transit and at rest, ensuring it remains **secret**, meaning concealed or kept from the knowledge of others, from unauthorized access."
How does confidentiality apply to data storage?,"**Confidentiality** applies to data storage by ensuring that the contents of data on both **temporary** and **persistent storage** are kept secret.
