What is the primary goal of confidentiality in computer security?,The primary goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This means ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot access or view sensitive information.
Explain the concept of Message/Data Integrity.,"Message/Data Integrity refers to the assurance that the contents of messages or data have not been modified by a third party during exchange. For instance, when Alice and Bob exchange messages, they aim to prevent any unauthorized entity from altering the information within those messages."
What is the goal of accountability in a security context?,"The goal of accountability is to ensure that in the event of a security incident, such as something going wrong or an erroneous transaction being identified, it is possible to determine who the attacker or principal involved was. This allows for tracing actions back to their source."
Describe what an available system means in terms of security.,An available system is defined as one that can respond to its users' requests within a reasonable timeframe. This implies that legitimate users can access and utilize the system and its resources when needed without undue delay or interruption.
What is the purpose of non-repudiation?,"The purpose of non-repudiation is to ensure the undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved. This means that a party cannot falsely deny having sent a message or performed a transaction, providing proof of origin and integrity."
What is authentication in the context of communication?,"Authentication is the process by which one party can verify the identity of another party. For example, if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, authentication ensures he can be sure he is communicating with the real Alice and not someone attempting to impersonate her."
What is one method Bob can use to authenticate Alice's identity?,"One method Bob can use to authenticate Alice's identity is based on ""something you know."" This refers to a piece of information that only Alice should know, such as a password or a PIN."
Identify a type of authentication method based on 'something you have'.,"A type of authentication method based on ""something you have"" involves possessing a specific item. Examples include a physical key, a smart card, or a token generator that Alice would possess to prove her identity."
Explain the 'something you are' method of authentication.,"The ""something you are"" method of authentication relies on unique biological or physical characteristics of an individual. This typically refers to biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, which are inherent to Alice's identity."
Compare and contrast Confidentiality with Message/Data Integrity.,"Confidentiality and Message/Data Integrity are both crucial security goals, but they address different aspects. Confidentiality aims to keep the contents of communication or data secret, preventing unauthorized disclosure. Message/Data Integrity, on the other hand, focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of the contents of messages or data by a third party. While confidentiality protects against eavesdropping, integrity protects against tampering."
What are the differences between Accountability and Non-Repudiation?,"Accountability and Non-Repudiation both relate to tracing actions, but they serve distinct purposes. Accountability's goal is to determine who the attacker or principal is when something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction occurs. Non-Repudiation, however, specifically aims to ensure the undeniability of a transaction by any involved parties, meaning a party cannot later deny having participated in or initiated a transaction. Accountability focuses on identifying responsibility after an event, while non-repudiation provides proof of participation to prevent denial."
How does Availability differ from Confidentiality?,"Availability and Confidentiality are distinct security principles. Confidentiality's goal is to keep the contents of communication or data secret, preventing unauthorized access or disclosure. Availability, conversely, ensures that a system can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe, meaning legitimate users can access resources when needed. Confidentiality is about secrecy, while availability is about access and responsiveness."
Compare Message/Data Integrity with Non-Repudiation.,"Message/Data Integrity and Non-Repudiation are related but distinct security concepts. Message/Data Integrity ensures that the contents of messages or data have not been modified by a third party. Non-Repudiation, however, ensures the undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved, preventing them from falsely denying their participation. Integrity focuses on the data's unaltered state, while non-repudiation focuses on proving the origin and participation in a transaction."
What security principle is concerned with keeping data secret?,"The security principle concerned with keeping data secret is confidentiality. Its goal is to ensure that the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage remain secret, meaning only authorized individuals can access them."
Which security concept aims to prevent a third party from modifying message contents?,"The security concept that aims to prevent a third party from modifying message contents is Message/Data Integrity. It ensures that the information exchanged, for example, between Alice and Bob, remains unaltered by unauthorized entities."
Which security principle helps determine the identity of an attacker or principal after a security incident?,Accountability is the security principle that helps determine the identity of an attacker or principal in the case that something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. It focuses on tracing actions to their source.
What characteristic defines an available system?,An available system is characterized by its ability to respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. This ensures that the system's resources and services are accessible and usable by legitimate users when needed.
What is the security goal that ensures the undeniability of a transaction?,"The security goal that ensures the undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved is non-repudiation. It provides proof that a transaction occurred and that specific parties participated, preventing them from later denying their involvement."
What is the primary purpose of authentication?,"The primary purpose of authentication is to verify the identity of a communicating party. For instance, it ensures that when Bob communicates with Alice, he can be certain he is interacting with the genuine Alice and not an impersonator."
Provide an example of an authentication method based on 'something you know'.,"An example of an authentication method based on ""something you know"" would be a password or a Personal Identification Number (PIN). These are secrets that only the legitimate user should possess and can provide to prove their identity."
Give an example of an authentication method that relies on 'something you have'.,"An example of an authentication method that relies on ""something you have"" could be a physical security token, a smart card, or a key. These are physical objects that the legitimate user possesses to prove their identity."
What is an example of an authentication method based on 'something you are'?,"An example of an authentication method based on ""something you are"" is a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint scan, facial recognition, or an iris scan. These methods use unique biological characteristics of an individual for identity verification."
"In the context of confidentiality, what does 'transient communication' refer to?","In the context of confidentiality, ""transient communication"" refers to data or messages that are in transit, meaning they are being actively exchanged between parties. Confidentiality aims to keep the contents of such communication secret during its transmission."
What is meant by 'persistent storage' in relation to confidentiality?,"In relation to confidentiality, ""persistent storage"" refers to data stored on long-term memory devices, where it remains even after the system is powered off. Confidentiality ensures that the contents of this stored data remain secret."
Who is considered a 'third party' in the context of Message/Data Integrity?,"In the context of Message/Data Integrity, a ""third party"" refers to any entity other than the intended sender (e.g., Alice) and receiver (e.g., Bob) of a message or data. This third party is an unauthorized entity that might attempt to modify the contents of their communication."
"In the definition of accountability, what is a 'principal'?","In the definition of accountability, a ""principal"" refers to an entity, such as a user, system, or process, that performs an action or is involved in a transaction. Accountability aims to identify this principal if something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified."
What does 'reasonable timeframe' signify for an available system?,"For an available system, ""reasonable timeframe"" signifies that the system responds to user requests promptly and without excessive delay. The specific duration can vary depending on the system's purpose and user expectations, but the core idea is that access and functionality are provided in an acceptable period."
Explain 'undeniability' as it relates to non-repudiation.,"""Undeniability"" in the context of non-repudiation means that a party involved in a transaction cannot legitimately refute or deny their participation or the authenticity of their actions. Non-repudiation provides evidence to prevent such false denials."
What fundamental question does authentication seek to answer?,"Authentication seeks to answer the fundamental question of identity verification: ""Is this person or entity who they claim to be?"" For example, it addresses how Bob can be sure he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her."
How many types of authentication methods are mentioned for verifying identity?,"There are three types of authentication methods mentioned for verifying identity: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" These methods can be used individually or in combination."
What is the difference between temporary and persistent storage in the context of confidentiality?,"In the context of confidentiality, both temporary and persistent storage refer to locations where data resides, and confidentiality aims to keep their contents secret. Temporary storage typically refers to volatile memory where data is held for short durations during processing. Persistent storage refers to non-volatile storage where data is stored long-term and remains even after power loss. Confidentiality applies to data in both states."
What is the role of a third party in Message/Data Integrity?,"In the context of Message/Data Integrity, a ""third party"" plays the role of an unauthorized entity that Alice and Bob do not want to be able to modify the contents of their messages. The goal of integrity is to prevent such a third party from tampering with the communication."
What is the potential consequence if accountability is not in place after an erroneous transaction?,"If accountability is not in place after an erroneous transaction, it would be impossible to determine who the attacker or principal was. This lack of identification would hinder investigation, remediation, and potentially allow malicious actors to operate without consequence."
What is the implication if a system is not available?,"If a system is not available, it implies that it cannot respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. This means legitimate users would be unable to access or utilize the system and its resources when needed, leading to service disruption."
What concept is non-repudiation designed to prevent?,"Non-repudiation is designed to prevent repudiation, which is the act of falsely denying participation in a transaction or the authenticity of an action. Its goal is to ensure the undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved."
"In the context of authentication, what does 'impersonate' mean?","In the context of authentication, ""impersonate"" means for one entity to pretend to be another, legitimate entity. For example, someone trying to impersonate Alice would attempt to deceive Bob into believing they are Alice, which authentication aims to prevent."
Can authentication use more than one method?,"Yes, Bob may be able to authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of the three types of methods: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" Using multiple methods, known as multi-factor authentication, enhances security."
"What is the overarching purpose of security concepts like confidentiality, integrity, and availability?","The overarching purpose of security concepts like confidentiality, integrity, and availability is to protect information and systems. Confidentiality keeps data secret, integrity prevents unauthorized modification, and availability ensures systems are accessible and responsive to legitimate users."
How does confidentiality protect data on temporary storage?,"Confidentiality protects data on temporary storage by ensuring that its contents are kept secret. This means that while data is actively being processed or held in volatile memory, unauthorized individuals cannot access or view it."
What is the primary concern of Message/Data Integrity regarding communication between parties like Alice and Bob?,The primary concern of Message/Data Integrity regarding communication between parties like Alice and Bob is to ensure that a third party is not able to modify the contents of their messages. It focuses on maintaining the unaltered state of the information exchanged.
How does accountability contribute to overall security?,Accountability contributes to overall security by enabling the determination of who the attacker or principal is when something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. This ability to trace actions helps deter malicious behavior and facilitates incident response.
What is the consequence if a system fails to respond to user requests in a reasonable timeframe?,"If a system fails to respond to user requests in a reasonable timeframe, it means the system lacks availability. The consequence is that users cannot access or utilize the system's services effectively, leading to frustration, lost productivity, or critical service disruption."
Why is ensuring the undeniability of a transaction important?,"Ensuring the undeniability of a transaction is important because it prevents any of the parties involved from falsely denying their participation or the authenticity of their actions. This provides proof and trust in digital interactions, which is the goal of non-repudiation."
What is the core problem authentication solves for Bob when communicating with Alice?,The core problem authentication solves for Bob when communicating with Alice is ensuring that he is indeed communicating with the real Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her. It provides assurance of the other party's identity.
Compare 'something you know' and 'something you have' authentication methods.,"The ""something you know"" authentication method relies on secret information that only the legitimate user should know, such as a password or PIN. The ""something you have"" method, conversely, depends on the user possessing a specific physical item, like a smart card or a security token. Both are distinct ways to verify identity, with one relying on knowledge and the other on possession."
What is the distinction between an 'attacker' and a 'principal' in the context of accountability?,"In the context of accountability, an ""attacker"" specifically refers to a malicious entity attempting to compromise a system or data. A ""principal,"" however, is a broader term referring to any entity (user, system, process) involved in an action or transaction. Accountability aims to identify either the attacker in a malicious event or the principal in an erroneous transaction."
How does confidentiality relate to data stored on persistent storage?,"Confidentiality relates to data stored on persistent storage by ensuring that the contents of that data remain secret. This means that even when data is saved long-term on devices like hard drives, it is protected from unauthorized access or disclosure."
What is the primary threat that Message/Data Integrity protects against?,The primary threat that Message/Data Integrity protects against is the unauthorized modification of the contents of messages or data by a third party. It ensures that the information remains unaltered from its original state during transmission or storage.
What is an 'erroneous transaction' in the context of accountability?,"An ""erroneous transaction"" in the context of accountability refers to a transaction that has gone wrong or was performed incorrectly, possibly due to error rather than malicious intent. Accountability's goal is to determine who the principal was in such a situation to understand the cause and take corrective action."
How does non-repudiation provide proof of a transaction?,"Non-repudiation provides proof of a transaction by ensuring its undeniability by any of the parties involved. While the document doesn't detail the mechanisms, the concept implies that sufficient evidence is generated and maintained to prevent a party from successfully denying their participation or the authenticity of their actions."
