What is the primary goal of confidentiality in computer security?,The primary goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
Define confidentiality in the context of data security.,"Confidentiality, in data security, refers to the objective of ensuring that the contents of any communication or data, regardless of whether it resides in temporary or persistent storage, are kept ""secret"" from unauthorized access."
"What does it mean for data to be ""secret"" under the principle of confidentiality?","For data to be ""secret"" under the principle of confidentiality means that its contents are protected from unauthorized disclosure. This applies to data in transit (transient communication) and data at rest (on temporary or persistent storage)."
Explain the concept of confidentiality regarding data storage.,"Regarding data storage, confidentiality aims to keep the contents of data ""secret"", whether that data is held in temporary storage (like RAM) or persistent storage (like a hard drive)."
How does confidentiality relate to transient communication?,"Confidentiality relates to transient communication by aiming to keep the contents of such communication secret. Transient communication refers to data being transmitted or exchanged, which is often temporary in nature."
What types of data does confidentiality protect?,"Confidentiality protects the contents of both transient communication and data stored on temporary or persistent storage, ensuring they remain secret."
Why is confidentiality important for communication?,"Confidentiality is important for communication to ensure that the contents of a transient communication remain secret, preventing unauthorized parties from accessing or understanding the exchanged information."
What is the objective of confidentiality concerning data on temporary storage?,"The objective of confidentiality concerning data on temporary storage is to keep the contents of that data secret, preventing unauthorized access while it is temporarily stored."
What is the objective of confidentiality concerning data on persistent storage?,"The objective of confidentiality concerning data on persistent storage is to keep the contents of that data secret, preventing unauthorized access while it is permanently stored."
Can you describe the scope of confidentiality?,The scope of confidentiality encompasses keeping the contents of transient communication and data on both temporary and persistent storage secret.
What is the purpose of message/data integrity?,"The purpose of message/data integrity is to ensure that when parties, such as Alice and Bob, exchange messages, a third party is unable to modify the contents of those messages."
Explain message integrity.,"Message integrity refers to the assurance that the contents of messages exchanged between parties, like Alice and Bob, have not been altered or modified by an unauthorized third party."
Why is it undesirable for a third party to modify message contents?,"It is undesirable for a third party to modify message contents because it compromises message integrity, meaning the recipient cannot trust that the message received is the same as the message sent by the original sender."
"What does ""data integrity"" mean in the context of communication?","In the context of communication, ""data integrity"" means that the data (or messages) exchanged between parties remains unaltered and uncorrupted by any unauthorized third party."
How does message integrity protect communication between Alice and Bob?,"Message integrity protects communication between Alice and Bob by ensuring that no third party can modify the contents of their messages, thereby preserving the authenticity and trustworthiness of the exchanged information."
What is the risk if message integrity is not maintained?,"If message integrity is not maintained, the risk is that a third party could modify the contents of messages exchanged between users, leading to corrupted or malicious information being received."
What is the primary concern addressed by message/data integrity?,The primary concern addressed by message/data integrity is the unauthorized modification of the contents of messages or data during exchange.
Who is prevented from modifying messages by message/data integrity?,Message/data integrity prevents a third party from being able to modify the contents of messages exchanged between communicating parties.
What aspect of messages does integrity focus on protecting?,"Integrity focuses on protecting the contents of messages, ensuring they remain unchanged from the original transmission."
Describe a scenario where message integrity is crucial.,"Message integrity is crucial in a scenario where Alice and Bob exchange messages and need assurance that the information they receive is exactly what the other party sent, without any modifications by an unauthorized third party."
What is the goal of accountability in computer security?,The goal of accountability in computer security is to ensure that you are able to determine who the attacker or principal is in the case that something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified.
Define accountability in the context of security.,"Accountability, in the context of security, is the ability to identify the individual or entity (the attacker or principal) responsible when a security incident occurs or an incorrect transaction is detected."
When is accountability particularly important?,"Accountability is particularly important when something goes wrong within a system or when an erroneous transaction is identified, as it allows for the determination of the responsible party."
"What does ""determine who the attacker or principal is"" mean for accountability?","To ""determine who the attacker or principal is"" for accountability means to identify the specific individual or entity that initiated or was responsible for an action, especially in cases of security breaches or errors."
How does accountability help in managing security incidents?,"Accountability helps in managing security incidents by providing the means to identify the attacker or principal involved when something goes wrong, which is crucial for investigation and remediation."
"What is an ""erroneous transaction"" in relation to accountability?","An ""erroneous transaction"" in relation to accountability refers to a transaction that is incorrect or flawed, and for which accountability aims to identify the principal responsible for its occurrence."
What is the primary outcome of achieving accountability?,"The primary outcome of achieving accountability is the ability to pinpoint the identity of the attacker or principal when an issue arises, such as a security breach or an erroneous transaction."
"Who is the ""principal"" that accountability seeks to identify?","The ""principal"" that accountability seeks to identify is the individual or entity responsible for an action, whether it's an attacker causing harm or a legitimate user involved in an erroneous transaction."
Why is identifying the attacker important for accountability?,"Identifying the attacker is important for accountability because it allows for the attribution of actions, which is essential for forensic analysis, legal proceedings, and preventing future incidents."
In what situations does accountability become relevant?,"Accountability becomes relevant in situations where something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified, requiring the determination of the responsible party."
What defines an available system?,An available system is defined as one that can respond to its users' requests within a reasonable timeframe.
Explain the concept of availability in computer systems.,"Availability in computer systems refers to the characteristic of a system being able to respond to its users' requests promptly, specifically within a reasonable timeframe."
"What is a ""reasonable timeframe"" in the context of system availability?","A ""reasonable timeframe"" in the context of system availability implies that the system's response time to user requests is acceptable and meets the expectations for its intended function, avoiding undue delays."
How does availability impact users?,"Availability impacts users by ensuring that they can access and receive responses from the system for their requests without excessive delays, thereby enabling them to perform their tasks effectively."
What is the key characteristic of an available system?,The key characteristic of an available system is its capacity to respond to user requests within a reasonable timeframe.
What happens if a system is not available?,"If a system is not available, it means it cannot respond to its users' requests within a reasonable timeframe, potentially leading to service disruption and user frustration."
What is the relationship between system response and availability?,"The relationship between system response and availability is direct: an available system is one that can respond to its users' requests, and it must do so within a reasonable timeframe."
How is system uptime related to availability?,"While not explicitly defined as ""uptime"", availability is directly related to a system's ability to be operational and responsive to users' requests within a reasonable timeframe, which implies it must be ""up"" and functioning."
What is the primary goal of ensuring system availability?,The primary goal of ensuring system availability is to guarantee that the system can consistently respond to its users' requests within a reasonable timeframe.
Describe the user experience with an available system.,"With an available system, users experience timely responses to their requests, meaning the system processes their commands and delivers results within a reasonable timeframe, allowing for smooth and efficient interaction."
What is the goal of non-repudiation?,The goal of non-repudiation is to ensure Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved.
Define non-repudiation.,"Non-repudiation is a security principle whose goal is to ensure the Undeniability of a transaction, meaning that no party involved in the transaction can legitimately deny having participated in it or having performed certain actions."
"What does ""undeniability of a transaction"" mean in non-repudiation?","""Undeniability of a transaction"" in non-repudiation means that once a transaction has occurred, none of the parties involved can later falsely claim that they did not participate in it or did not authorize it."
Who is prevented from denying a transaction by non-repudiation?,Non-repudiation prevents any of the parties involved in a transaction from denying their participation or actions related to that transaction.
Why is non-repudiation important for transactions?,"Non-repudiation is important for transactions because it provides proof of origin and integrity, ensuring that all parties are held accountable for their actions and cannot falsely disclaim involvement."
What is the primary benefit of non-repudiation?,"The primary benefit of non-repudiation is the assurance that a transaction cannot be denied by any of the involved parties, providing a strong basis for trust and accountability."
What is the fundamental question addressed by authentication?,"The fundamental question addressed by authentication is how one party, for example, Bob, can be sure that he is communicating with the intended party, Alice, and not someone attempting to impersonate her."
What are the three types of methods Bob can use to authenticate Alice's identity?,"Bob can authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of three types of methods: something she knows, something she has, and something she is."
"Give examples of ""something you know"" for authentication.","""Something you know"" for authentication refers to information that only the legitimate user should possess, such as a password or a PIN."
"Give examples of ""something you have"" for authentication.","""Something you have"" for authentication refers to a physical item or token that only the legitimate user should possess, such as a smart card, a security token, or a mobile phone for a one-time password."
"Give examples of ""something you are"" for authentication.","""Something you are"" for authentication refers to unique biological characteristics of the legitimate user, such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or an iris scan (biometrics)."
How does authentication help prevent impersonation?,"Authentication helps prevent impersonation by providing mechanisms for one party (e.g., Bob) to verify the identity of another party (e.g., Alice), ensuring that they are communicating with the legitimate individual and not an impostor."
What is the purpose of authentication in a communication scenario?,"In a communication scenario, the purpose of authentication is to allow one party to verify the identity of the other party, ensuring that they are indeed communicating with the claimed individual and not an unauthorized impersonator."
What is the core challenge authentication aims to solve?,"The core challenge authentication aims to solve is verifying the identity of a communicating party to ensure they are who they claim to be, thereby preventing impersonation."
