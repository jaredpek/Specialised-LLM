This verification prevents unauthorized access, fraudulent transactions, and ensures the integrity and confidentiality of their communication. \n\n*   **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device. \n*   **Impersonate:** To pretend to be another person or entity, typically to gain unauthorized access or information."
What is the primary concern for data on 'temporary storage' regarding confidentiality?,"The primary concern for data on 'temporary storage' regarding confidentiality is to keep its contents secret. This means protecting data held in memory or caches for short durations from unauthorized disclosure, even if it's not permanently saved. \n\n*   **Confidentiality:** A security principle aimed at preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. \n*   **Temporary storage:** Data held in memory or caches for short durations. \n*   **Secret:** Information that is protected from unauthorized access or knowledge."
What is the consequence if message/data integrity is compromised?,"If message/data integrity is compromised, it means that a third party has been able to modify the contents of messages. The consequence is that the data can no longer be trusted as accurate or unaltered from its original state, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or actions based on falsified information. \n\n*   **Message/Data Integrity:** A security principle that ensures information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. \n*   **Third party:** Any entity other than the two communicating parties who might intercept or tamper with data. \n*   **Modify the contents:** To make unauthorized changes to the information or data being transmitted or stored."
How does accountability support auditing processes?,"Accountability supports auditing processes by ensuring that it is possible to determine who the attacker or principal is in the case that something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. This capability to trace actions back to specific entities provides the necessary evidence for auditors to review activities, identify discrepancies, and verify compliance. \n\n*   **Accountability:** A security principle that ensures that the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to that entity. \n*   **Attacker:** An individual or entity attempting to compromise a system or data. \n*   **Principal:** An entity (user, process, host) that can be granted or denied access to a resource. \n*   **Erroneous transaction:** A transaction that is incorrect, unauthorized, or deviates from expected behavior."
What is the primary objective of ensuring a system is 'available'?,"The primary objective of ensuring a system is 'available' is to guarantee that it can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. This ensures that authorized users have timely and uninterrupted access to the system's resources and services when they need them. \n\n*   **Available system:** A system that is accessible and usable by authorized users when needed. \n*   **Reasonable timeframe:** The expected and acceptable duration within which a system should process and respond to user requests, varying based on the system's function and user expectations."
Why is 'undeniability' crucial for non-repudiation?,"'Undeniability' is crucial for non-repudiation because the entire goal of non-repudiation is to ensure that a transaction cannot be denied by any of the parties involved. Without undeniability, parties could falsely disclaim their actions, undermining trust and accountability in transactions. \n\n*   **Non-repudiation:** A security principle that provides irrefutable proof of an action, preventing an entity from falsely denying that they performed a particular action. \n*   **Undeniability:** The state of being impossible to deny or dispute, especially concerning the origin or execution of a transaction. \n*   **Transaction:** A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work."
What is the core problem that authentication solves in a communication scenario?,"The core problem that authentication solves in a communication scenario is verifying the identity of the communicating parties. Specifically, it addresses the question of how one party (e.g., Bob) can be sure they are communicating with the intended party (Alice) and not an impersonator, thereby preventing identity deception. \n\n*   **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device. \n*   **Impersonator:** Someone who pretends to be another person or entity."
How does confidentiality protect data on 'persistent storage'?,"Confidentiality protects data on 'persistent storage' by aiming to keep its contents secret. This means that data stored on non-volatile media like hard drives or SSDs, which remains even after power loss, is protected from unauthorized access or viewing by individuals who do not have the necessary permissions. \n\n*   **Confidentiality:** A security principle aimed at preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. \n*   **Persistent storage:** Data stored on non-volatile media like hard drives or SSDs, remaining even after power loss. \n*   **Secret:** Information that is protected from unauthorized access or knowledge."
What is the primary concern regarding 'contents' in the context of message/data integrity?,"The primary concern regarding 'contents' in the context of message/data integrity is to prevent their unauthorized modification by a third party. This ensures that the information within messages remains exactly as intended by the sender, without any alterations during transmission or storage. \n\n*   **Message/Data Integrity:** A security principle that ensures information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. \n*   **Modify the contents:** To make unauthorized changes to the information or data being transmitted or stored. \n*   **Third party:** Any entity other than the two communicating parties who might intercept or tamper with data."
What is the significance of identifying the 'principal' in accountability?,"Identifying the 'principal' in accountability is significant because it allows for the tracing of actions to a specific entity (user, process, host) that can be granted or denied access to a resource. This is crucial for understanding the source of an issue, whether it's an attacker or an authorized user making an erroneous transaction, and for enforcing appropriate consequences or corrective measures. \n\n*   **Accountability:** A security principle that ensures that the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to that entity. \n*   **Principal:** An entity (user, process, host) that can be granted or denied access to a resource. \n*   **Erroneous transaction:** A transaction that is incorrect, unauthorized, or deviates from expected behavior."
How does the concept of 'available system' relate to system uptime?,"The concept of an 'available system' directly relates to system uptime, as an available system is one that can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. High system uptime contributes to availability by ensuring the system is operational and responsive for extended periods, meeting user demands. \n\n*   **Available system:** A system that is accessible and usable by authorized users when needed. \n*   **Reasonable timeframe:** The expected and acceptable duration within which a system should process and respond to user requests."
What is the fundamental difference between non-repudiation and authentication?,"The fundamental difference between non-repudiation and authentication lies in their primary goals. Authentication aims to verify the identity of a party (e.g., Alice) to ensure communication is with the legitimate entity and not an impersonator. Non-repudiation, on the other hand, aims to ensure the undeniability of a transaction by any involved parties, providing irrefutable proof of actions after they have occurred. \n\n*   **Non-repudiation:** A security principle that provides irrefutable proof of an action, preventing an entity from falsely denying that they performed a particular action. \n*   **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device. \n*   **Undeniability:** The state of being impossible to deny or dispute. \n*   **Impersonator:** Someone who pretends to be another person or entity."
