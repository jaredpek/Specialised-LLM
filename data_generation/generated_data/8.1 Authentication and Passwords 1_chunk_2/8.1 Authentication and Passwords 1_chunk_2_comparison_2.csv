What is the primary goal of confidentiality in computer security?,"The primary goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This means ensuring that unauthorized individuals cannot access or view sensitive information, whether it's actively being transmitted or stored."
Define message or data integrity.,"Message or data integrity refers to the principle that when parties, such as Alice and Bob, exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages. Its goal is to ensure that data remains unaltered and accurate during transmission and storage, preventing unauthorized changes."
What is the purpose of accountability in a security context?,"The purpose of accountability is to ensure that in the event something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified, it is possible to determine who the attacker or principal is. This allows for tracing actions back to their source and holding responsible parties answerable."
Describe what an available system means.,"An available system is one that can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. This implies that the system's resources and services are accessible and operational when needed, without undue delay or interruption."
Explain the concept of non-repudiation.,"Non-repudiation is a security goal aimed at ensuring the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved. This means that a party cannot falsely deny having sent a message or having performed a transaction, providing proof of origin and integrity of the data."
What is the main objective of authentication?,"The main objective of authentication is to verify identity. For instance, if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, authentication ensures he can be sure that he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her. It establishes trust in the identity of a user or entity."
What types of storage are relevant to confidentiality?,"Confidentiality aims to keep the contents of transient communication or data secret, whether that data is on temporary or persistent storage. \""Transient communication\"" refers to data in transit, while \""temporary storage\"" and \""persistent storage\"" refer to data at rest for short or long durations, respectively."
Who are the parties typically involved in a message exchange where data integrity is a concern?,"In a message exchange where data integrity is a concern, the parties typically involved are the sender and receiver, for example, Alice and Bob. The concern is to prevent a third party from being able to modify the contents of their messages."
What specific information does accountability help determine?,Accountability helps to determine who the attacker or principal is in the case that something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. This allows for tracing actions and assigning responsibility.
What are the three types of methods Bob may use to authenticate Alice's identity?,"Bob may be able to authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of three types of methods: something you know, something you have, and something you are. These categories represent different factors used to establish and confirm identity."
Compare confidentiality with message integrity.,"Confidentiality focuses on keeping the contents of transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, preventing unauthorized disclosure. Message integrity, on the other hand, aims to prevent a third party from modifying the contents of messages exchanged between parties like Alice and Bob, ensuring data remains unaltered and accurate."
What are the differences between confidentiality and message/data integrity?,"Confidentiality's goal is to keep information secret, meaning only authorized parties can access its contents. Message/data integrity's goal is to ensure that the contents of messages are not modified by unauthorized third parties, preserving their accuracy and completeness. While confidentiality protects against unauthorized viewing, integrity protects against unauthorized alteration."
How does confidentiality differ from accountability?,"Confidentiality is concerned with keeping data secret, preventing its unauthorized disclosure. Accountability, however, is focused on being able to determine who the attacker or principal is if something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. Confidentiality protects the data itself, while accountability identifies the actors behind actions."
Explain the distinction between confidentiality and availability.,"Confidentiality aims to keep the contents of communication or data secret, ensuring only authorized access. Availability, conversely, describes a system that can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe, ensuring that services are accessible and operational. Confidentiality is about secrecy, while availability is about accessibility and responsiveness."
Contrast confidentiality with non-repudiation.,"Confidentiality's objective is to keep data secret, preventing unauthorized disclosure. Non-repudiation, however, aims to ensure the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved, meaning a party cannot falsely deny having performed an action. Confidentiality protects the content from being seen, while non-repudiation provides proof of action."
What differentiates confidentiality from authentication?,"Confidentiality is about keeping the contents of data or communication secret. Authentication, on the other hand, is about verifying the identity of a party, such as ensuring Bob is communicating with the real Alice and not an impersonator. Confidentiality protects the data itself, while authentication verifies who is accessing or communicating."
Compare message integrity with accountability.,"Message integrity focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of message contents by a third party. Accountability, in contrast, aims to determine who the attacker or principal is when something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction occurs. Integrity ensures data accuracy, while accountability identifies responsible parties for actions."
What are the differences between message/data integrity and availability?,"Message/data integrity ensures that the contents of messages are not modified by a third party. Availability, however, refers to a system's ability to respond to user requests within a reasonable timeframe. Integrity is about the trustworthiness of data content, while availability is about the accessibility and responsiveness of the system."
How does message integrity relate to non-repudiation?,"Message integrity ensures that the contents of messages are not modified by a third party. Non-repudiation ensures the Undeniability of a transaction by any involved parties. While integrity confirms the data hasn't been tampered with, non-repudiation provides proof that a specific party initiated or participated in a transaction, often relying on integrity to ensure the proven transaction is the original one."
Explain the distinction between message integrity and authentication.,"Message integrity is concerned with preventing unauthorized modification of message contents. Authentication, conversely, is about verifying the identity of a party, ensuring that communication is with the intended entity. Integrity protects the data from alteration, while authentication verifies who is sending or receiving that data."
Compare accountability with availability.,"Accountability's goal is to determine who the attacker or principal is when an issue or erroneous transaction arises. Availability, in contrast, describes a system that can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. Accountability focuses on identifying actors, while availability focuses on system uptime and responsiveness."
What are the differences between accountability and non-repudiation?,"Accountability aims to determine who the attacker or principal is in the event of a problem or erroneous transaction. Non-repudiation, on the other hand, ensures the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved. Accountability identifies the source of an issue, while non-repudiation prevents a party from denying their involvement in a transaction."
How does accountability differ from authentication?,"Accountability is about determining who the attacker or principal is when something goes wrong. Authentication is about verifying the identity of a party, ensuring they are who they claim to be. Authentication establishes identity at the point of access or communication, while accountability provides a means to trace actions back to an identified principal after an event."
Compare availability with non-repudiation.,"Availability refers to a system's ability to respond to user requests in a reasonable timeframe, ensuring services are accessible. Non-repudiation, however, aims to ensure the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved. Availability focuses on system uptime and performance, while non-repudiation focuses on proving the origin and integrity of actions."
What are the differences between availability and authentication?,"Availability means a system can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe, ensuring service accessibility. Authentication, in contrast, is about verifying the identity of a party, such as ensuring Bob is communicating with Alice and not an impersonator. Availability is about the system being ready to serve, while authentication is about verifying who is being served or is serving."
Compare non-repudiation with authentication.,"Non-repudiation ensures the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved, preventing them from falsely denying their actions. Authentication, on the other hand, is about verifying the identity of a party, ensuring they are who they claim to be. Authentication establishes identity, which can then be used to support non-repudiation by linking an action to a verified identity."
What is the primary concern addressed by confidentiality?,The primary concern addressed by confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This means preventing unauthorized disclosure of information.
"In the context of message exchange, what does data integrity aim to prevent?","In the context of message exchange, data integrity aims to prevent a third party from being able to modify the contents of messages exchanged between parties like Alice and Bob. It ensures the accuracy and unaltered state of the data."
When is accountability particularly important?,"Accountability is particularly important in the case that something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified, as its goal is to ensure that you are able to determine who the attacker or principal is."
What defines a 'reasonable timeframe' in the context of system availability?,An available system is one that can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe. This 'reasonable timeframe' is the expected duration within which a system should deliver a response to ensure its services are accessible and operational for users.
What is meant by 'undeniability of a transaction' in non-repudiation?,"In non-repudiation, 'undeniability of a transaction' means that any of the parties involved in a transaction cannot falsely deny having sent a message or having performed an action. The goal of non-repudiation is to ensure this very aspect."
What question does authentication seek to answer regarding communication?,"Authentication seeks to answer the question: if one party (e.g., Bob) wants to communicate with another (e.g., Alice), how can he be sure that he is communicating with the intended party and not someone trying to impersonate her? It's about verifying identity."
Can you explain the concept of 'transient communication' in relation to confidentiality?,"In relation to confidentiality, 'transient communication' refers to the contents of communication that are actively being transmitted. The goal of confidentiality is to keep these contents secret, along with data on temporary or persistent storage, preventing unauthorized access during transit."
What is the role of a 'third party' in the context of message/data integrity?,"In the context of message/data integrity, a 'third party' is an unauthorized entity that Alice and Bob do not want to be able to modify the contents of their messages. The role of integrity is to prevent such modifications."
Who is a 'principal' in the context of accountability?,"In the context of accountability, a 'principal' is an individual or entity whose actions can be determined in the case that something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. The goal of accountability is to identify this principal or an attacker."
What is meant by 'something you know' in authentication?,"In authentication, 'something you know' refers to one of the three types of methods used to authenticate and verify identity. It represents a knowledge-based factor that a user possesses to prove their identity."
What is meant by 'something you have' in authentication?,"In authentication, 'something you have' refers to one of the three types of methods used to authenticate and verify identity. It represents a possession-based factor that a user physically holds to prove their identity."
What is meant by 'something you are' in authentication?,"In authentication, 'something you are' refers to one of the three types of methods used to authenticate and verify identity. It represents an inherence-based factor, typically a unique biological characteristic, used to prove identity."
How does the goal of keeping data secret (confidentiality) differ from ensuring data is unaltered (integrity)?,"The goal of keeping data secret, which is confidentiality, aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the contents of transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage. Ensuring data is unaltered, which is message/data integrity, aims to prevent a third party from modifying the contents of messages exchanged between parties like Alice and Bob. Confidentiality is about privacy of content, while integrity is about the trustworthiness and accuracy of content."
What is the relationship between authentication and the prevention of impersonation?,"Authentication's core purpose is to prevent impersonation. When Bob wants to communicate with Alice, authentication ensures he can be sure he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her. It verifies the identity of the communicating party."
Can a system be available but not confidential?,"Yes, a system can be available but not confidential. An available system is one that can respond to its users' requests in a reasonable timeframe, meaning it is accessible and operational. However, confidentiality specifically refers to keeping the contents of communication or data secret. A system could be fully operational and responsive (available) but fail to protect its data from unauthorized disclosure (not confidential)."
Can a system have integrity but lack accountability?,"Yes, a system can have integrity but lack accountability. Message/data integrity ensures that the contents of messages are not modified by a third party. Accountability, however, is the ability to determine who the attacker or principal is if something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. A system might successfully prevent data modification (integrity) but still be unable to trace the source of an attack or error (lack accountability)."
What is the difference in focus between non-repudiation and accountability?,"Non-repudiation focuses on ensuring the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved, preventing them from falsely denying their actions. Accountability, on the other hand, focuses on determining who the attacker or principal is when something goes wrong or an erroneous transaction is identified. Non-repudiation proves an action occurred by a specific party, while accountability identifies the responsible party for an event."
How does authentication contribute to overall security?,"Authentication contributes to overall security by verifying the identity of parties involved in communication or transactions. For example, it ensures that Bob is communicating with Alice and not an impersonator. This foundational step is crucial for establishing trust and enabling other security principles."
What is the significance of a 'reasonable timeframe' for availability?,"The significance of a 'reasonable timeframe' for availability is that it ensures a system can respond to its users' requests promptly. This responsiveness is key to the system being considered 'available,' meaning its services are accessible and operational when users need them, without unacceptable delays."
What kind of data is protected by confidentiality?,"Confidentiality protects the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage. This encompasses data both in transit and at rest, ensuring it remains secret from unauthorized access."
Who are 'Alice and Bob' in the context of message/data integrity?,"Alice and Bob are illustrative examples of parties who exchange messages. In the context of message/data integrity, they represent the sender and receiver who do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages."
What is the relationship between 'undeniability' and 'non-repudiation'?,"The relationship is direct: the goal of non-repudiation is to ensure the Undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved. 'Undeniability' is the core characteristic that non-repudiation seeks to achieve, meaning a party cannot falsely deny their participation or actions in a transaction."
How do temporary and persistent storage relate to confidentiality?,"Temporary and persistent storage are types of data storage where confidentiality aims to keep the contents secret. Confidentiality applies to data regardless of whether it is stored for a short duration (temporary storage) or a long duration (persistent storage), as well as to data in transient communication."
What is the primary distinction between confidentiality and non-repudiation?,"The primary distinction is that confidentiality focuses on keeping data secret to prevent unauthorized disclosure, while non-repudiation aims to ensure the Undeniability of a transaction by any involved parties, preventing false denials of actions. Confidentiality protects the content itself, whereas non-repudiation provides proof of an action's origin and integrity."
