Why are multiple authentication factors often used?,"Multiple authentication factors are often used to enhance security by combining different types of verification methods. For instance, using 'something you know' with 'something you have' makes it harder for an impersonator to gain access, as they would need to compromise more than one factor to verify identity.\n\n*   Authentication factors: The distinct types of credentials used to verify an identity, including something you know, something you have, and something you are.\n*   Impersonator: An individual attempting to assume the identity of another person or entity."
How does authentication prevent impersonation?,"Authentication prevents impersonation by requiring a party, such as Alice, to prove her identity using one or more methods (something she knows, has, or is) before another party, like Bob, can be sure he is communicating with the genuine Alice. This verification process confirms the identity and thwarts attempts by others to pretend to be her.\n\n*   Authentication: The process of verifying an entity's identity.\n*   Impersonation: The act of pretending to be another person or entity to deceive others."
