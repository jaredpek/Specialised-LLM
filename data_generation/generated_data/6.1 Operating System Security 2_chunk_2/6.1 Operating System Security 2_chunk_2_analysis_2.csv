Analyse the introduction of hypervisor with respect to attack surface.,"The introduction of a hypervisor can significantly increase the attack surface. This is primarily due to the hypervisor having a large codebase, which inevitably leads to a greater number of software bugs. Furthermore, the hypervisor operates with higher privileges than the operating system (OS) kernel. If the hypervisor itself is compromised, an attacker can gain control over the entire system more easily."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of hypervisor's impact on VM performance?,"The performance of a Virtual Machine (VM) can be negatively affected by other VMs. This occurs because VMs often share hardware resources, leading to potential contention and performance degradation for individual VMs."
Explain the challenges of malware analysis when using virtualization.,"Malware analysis presents several challenges when employing virtualization. Firstly, despite the hypervisor having a comprehensive view of Virtual Machines (VMs), there are semantic gaps between the high-level activities occurring within the VMs and the low-level behaviors that are observed. Secondly, this approach is not compatible with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Thirdly, sophisticated malware can detect if it is running within a VM rather than a genuine environment. It achieves this by observing characteristics such as larger memory latency variance, reduced Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) size, and other similar indicators. Upon detection, the malware may alter its behavior to mimic that of normal applications."
