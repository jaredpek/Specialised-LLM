List the primary defenses against SQL Injection as described in the document.,"The primary defenses against SQL Injection include: 1. **Parametrized Queries**: This method ensures that user input is treated as data rather than as a command. 2. **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)**: ORMs abstract SQL generation, which helps to reduce the risk of injection. 3. **Input Inspection**: This involves sanitization, validation, and whitelisting to handle user input securely."
Explain what parametrized queries are and provide an example of their usage in preventing SQL Injection.,"**Parametrized queries** are a defense mechanism against SQL Injection that ensures user input is treated strictly as data, not as a command. This prevents malicious input from being interpreted as executable SQL code. An example of its usage is `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`, where `?` acts as a placeholder for the `name` variable, ensuring it's passed as data."
Describe the role of an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) in defending against SQL Injection.,"An **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)** plays a crucial role in defending against SQL Injection by abstracting SQL generation. This abstraction reduces the risk of injection by allowing developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, rather than writing raw SQL queries. The ORM handles the underlying SQL generation, often using parameterized queries internally, thereby preventing direct manipulation of SQL commands through user input."
Detail the methods involved in 'Input inspection' as a defense against SQL Injection.,"Input inspection, as a defense against SQL Injection, involves several methods: 1. **Sanitization**: This process involves escaping dangerous characters in user input to neutralize their potential to alter SQL commands. 2. **Validation**: This method focuses on validating user input and rejecting any input that is malformed or does not conform to expected formats. 3. **Whitelist**: This approach involves only choosing or allowing values from a predefined set of permitted values, effectively blocking any input that is not explicitly approved."
Categorize the general approaches to defending against SQL Injection.,"The general approaches to defending against SQL Injection can be categorized into three main areas: 1. **Using parametrized queries**, which ensures user input is treated as data, not commands. 2. **Employing an Object Relational Mapper (ORM)**, which abstracts SQL generation and inherently reduces injection risks. 3. **Implementing robust Input inspection**, which includes sanitization, validation, and whitelisting of user input."
"Provide an example of how an object might be defined using an ORM, as shown in the document.","An example of an object definition using an ORM, as shown in the document, is for a `user` class inheriting from `DBObject`. It defines attributes like `name`, `age`, and `passsword` with their respective data types and constraints: `class user(DBObject) {\n  name = Column(String(255));\n  age = Column(Integer);\n  passsword = Column(String(255));\n}`."
Define JavaScript according to the document.,"**JavaScript** is defined as a programming language for web applications. It is used to make websites more interactive, with the server sending JavaScript code to the client, and the browser then running it."
What is the role of JavaScript in web applications?,"In web applications, **JavaScript** serves as a programming language that makes websites more interactive. The server sends JavaScript code to the client's browser, which then executes the code."
How can JavaScript be directly embedded in HTML?,"JavaScript can be directly embedded in HTML using the `<script>` tag. An example provided is `<html>\n<body>\n<script>alert(Date())</script>\n</body>\n</html>`, where the JavaScript code `alert(Date())` is placed within the `<script>` and `</script>` tags inside the HTML `<body>`."
Explain the basic idea behind a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.,"The basic idea behind a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack is that an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a legitimate website. When victim clients visit this compromised website, their browsers receive and execute the malicious code on their local computers. This malicious code can then be used to insert malware into the victims' computers or to collect private information and send it to a remote attacker."
What are the potential consequences for victims of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack?,"The potential consequences for victims of a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack include the insertion of malware into their computers or the collection of private information, which is then sent to a remote attacker. This occurs when their browsers execute malicious JavaScript code injected into a legitimate website."
List the two main types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.,The two main types of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS**.
Define a Stored XSS Attack.,"A **Stored XSS Attack**, also known as a Persistent XSS attack, is characterized by the attacker's malicious code being stored persistently on the legitimate website. This means the injected script resides on the server and is delivered to any user who requests the affected page."
Describe the sequence of events in a Stored XSS Attack.,"The sequence of events in a **Stored XSS Attack** is as follows: 1. The attacker discovers an XSS vulnerability in a website. 2. The attacker embeds malicious commands inside the input and sends it to the website. 3. The malicious command is then injected and stored on the website. 4. A victim later browses the compromised website, and the malicious command runs on the victim's computer."
Define a Reflected XSS Attack.,"A **Reflected XSS Attack**, also known as a Non-persistent XSS attack, occurs when the attacker tricks the victim into putting malicious code into a request, and this code is then reflected from the server back to the victim's browser and executed. The malicious code is not stored on the server."
Outline the steps involved in a Reflected XSS Attack.,"The steps involved in a **Reflected XSS Attack** are: 1. The attacker discovers an XSS vulnerability in a website. 2. The attacker creates a link that contains malicious commands. 3. The attacker distributes this malicious link to victims, often via emails or phishing links. 4. A victim accidentally clicks the link, which activates the malicious commands, causing them to be reflected from the server and executed on the victim's computer."
What is the key difference between Stored XSS and Reflected XSS?,"The key difference between **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS** lies in where the malicious code resides and how it's delivered. In Stored XSS, the attacker's code is stored persistently on the legitimate website itself. In contrast, with Reflected XSS, the malicious code is not stored on the server but is instead included in the victim's request and then reflected back from the server to the victim's browser for execution."
What are the main categories of defenses against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?,The main categories of defenses against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** are **Content Security Policy (CSP)** and **Input inspection**.
Define Content Security Policy (CSP) and explain its purpose in defending against XSS.,"**Content Security Policy (CSP)** is a defense mechanism against XSS that instructs the browser to only use resources loaded from specific, allowed places. Its purpose is to mitigate XSS attacks by restricting which resources (like scripts, stylesheets, images) a browser is permitted to load and execute for a given page, thereby preventing the execution of malicious injected scripts."
How are Content Security Policies enforced?,Content Security Policies (CSP) are enforced by the browser. The browser interprets the policy defined by the website and applies the specified restrictions on resource loading and script execution.
Provide examples of policies that can be implemented using Content Security Policy (CSP).,"Examples of policies that can be implemented using **Content Security Policy (CSP)** include: 1. Disallowing all inline scripts, which prevents scripts embedded directly within HTML from executing. 2. Only allowing scripts from specific domains, which restricts script execution to trusted sources."
What methods are involved in 'Input inspection' as a defense against XSS?,"Input inspection, as a defense against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, involves two primary methods: 1. **Sanitization**: This process entails escaping dangerous characters in user input to prevent them from being interpreted as executable code. 2. **Validation**: This method focuses on validating user input and rejecting any input that is malformed or does not adhere to expected security standards."
Explain the role of sanitization in defending against XSS attacks.,"The role of **sanitization** in defending against **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks is to escape dangerous characters within user input. By escaping these characters, they are rendered harmless and cannot be interpreted as executable script code by the browser, thus preventing the injection and execution of malicious scripts."
What is the purpose of validating input in the context of XSS defense?,"The purpose of **validating input** in the context of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** defense is to reject malformed input. This ensures that only input conforming to expected formats and safety criteria is processed, preventing attackers from submitting data that could be used to inject malicious scripts."
"Based on the document, what is the fundamental difference between SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks?","Based on the document, the fundamental difference is that **SQL Injection** targets the database by manipulating SQL queries through user input, aiming to treat data as commands. In contrast, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** targets client-side browsers by injecting malicious JavaScript code into legitimate websites, aiming to execute scripts on the victim's local computer."
"How do parametrized queries ensure user input is treated as data, not command?","Parametrized queries ensure user input is treated as data, not command, by using placeholders (like `?` in the example `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`). When the query is executed, the database engine separates the query structure from the actual data. The input provided for the placeholder is then passed as a literal value, preventing it from being interpreted as part of the SQL command itself, thus neutralizing injection attempts."
What is a key benefit of using an ORM for developers in terms of security?,"A key benefit of using an **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)** for developers in terms of security is that it abstracts SQL generation. This means developers don't have to manually construct SQL queries, which inherently reduces the risk of introducing SQL Injection vulnerabilities, as the ORM typically handles secure query construction."
Define whitelisting in the context of input inspection for SQL Injection defense.,"**Whitelisting**, in the context of input inspection for SQL Injection defense, is a security measure where only explicitly allowed values are accepted from user input. Its purpose is to strictly control what data can be processed, effectively rejecting any input that is not on the predefined list of safe or permitted values, thereby preventing malicious input from being used."
Where is JavaScript code executed in a web application?,"In a web application, **JavaScript** code is executed on the client-side, specifically by the user's browser, after the server sends the code to the client."
What is the ultimate goal of an attacker performing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack?,"The ultimate goal of an attacker performing a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack is to inject malicious JavaScript code into a legitimate website, which is then executed on victim clients' local computers. This allows the attacker to potentially insert malware or collect private information from the victims."
What is another name for a Stored XSS Attack?,Another name for a **Stored XSS Attack** is a **Persistent XSS Attack**.
What is another name for a Reflected XSS Attack?,Another name for a **Reflected XSS Attack** is a **Non-persistent XSS Attack**.
"In a Stored XSS attack, where is the attacker's malicious code stored?","In a **Stored XSS attack**, the attacker's malicious code is stored persistently on the legitimate website itself, after being embedded inside the input and sent to the website."
How is the malicious code typically delivered to the victim in a Reflected XSS attack?,"In a **Reflected XSS attack**, the malicious code is typically delivered to the victim via a link created by the attacker. This link contains the malicious commands and is distributed to victims, often through emails or phishing links. When the victim clicks the link, the commands are activated and reflected from the server."
How does Content Security Policy (CSP) limit the resources a browser can use?,"**Content Security Policy (CSP)** limits the resources a browser can use by instructing the browser to only use resources loaded from specific, allowed places. This means that if a script or other resource attempts to load from an unauthorized domain or is an inline script when inline scripts are disallowed, the browser will block it according to the enforced policy."
What common defense mechanism is shared between SQL Injection and XSS attacks?,"The common defense mechanism shared between **SQL Injection** and **XSS attacks** is **Input inspection**. For both, this involves sanitization (escaping dangerous characters) and validation (rejecting malformed input). For SQL Injection, whitelisting is also mentioned as part of input inspection."
What is the fundamental principle behind using parametrized queries to prevent SQL Injection regarding user input?,"The fundamental principle behind using parametrized queries to prevent **SQL Injection** is to ensure that user input is consistently treated as data, not as a command. This prevents any part of the user's input from being interpreted as an executable SQL instruction, thereby thwarting attempts to manipulate the database query."
Explain what 'Abstract SQL generation' means in the context of an ORM's defense against SQL Injection.,"'**Abstract SQL generation**' in the context of an **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)**'s defense against SQL Injection means that the ORM handles the creation of SQL queries automatically, based on the object-oriented code written by the developer. This removes the need for developers to write raw SQL, and the ORM typically generates secure, parameterized queries, reducing the chance of injection vulnerabilities."
What is the general purpose of sanitization in web security?,"The general purpose of **sanitization** in web security, as applied to both SQL Injection and XSS defenses, is to escape dangerous characters in user input. This process neutralizes characters that could be interpreted as executable code or commands, thereby preventing various types of injection attacks."
What is the general purpose of validation in web security?,"The general purpose of **validation** in web security, as applied to both SQL Injection and XSS defenses, is to validate user input and reject any input that is malformed. This ensures that only data conforming to expected formats and safety rules is processed, preventing the use of malicious or improperly structured input."
How does JavaScript contribute to the user experience of a website?,"**JavaScript** contributes to the user experience of a website by making it more interactive. It allows for dynamic content updates, animations, form validations, and other client-side functionalities that enhance user engagement without requiring a full page reload."
What is the initial step an attacker takes in both Stored and Reflected XSS attacks?,The initial step an attacker takes in both **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS** attacks is to discover an XSS vulnerability in a website.
What action by a victim triggers the execution of malicious code in a Stored XSS attack?,"In a **Stored XSS attack**, the execution of malicious code is triggered when a victim browses the website where the attacker's command has been injected and persistently stored."
What action by a victim triggers the execution of malicious code in a Reflected XSS attack?,"In a **Reflected XSS attack**, the execution of malicious code is triggered when a victim accidentally clicks a malicious link distributed by the attacker, which then activates the malicious commands reflected from the server."
What is the browser's role in implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)?,"The browser's role in implementing **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is to enforce the policies. It interprets the instructions from the CSP and ensures that only resources loaded from specific, allowed places are used, and that scripts adhere to the defined rules (e.g., disallowing inline scripts or allowing scripts only from specific domains)."
"In the example `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`, what is the purpose of the `?` character?","In the example `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`, the `?` character serves as a placeholder. Its purpose is to indicate where the user input (`name`) should be inserted into the SQL query, ensuring that this input is treated strictly as data and not as part of the SQL command itself, thereby preventing SQL Injection."
"In the ORM example, what does `Column(String(255))` signify?","In the ORM example `name = Column(String(255))`, `Column(String(255))` signifies the definition of a database column. `Column` indicates it's a column, `String` specifies the data type as a string, and `255` indicates the maximum length of that string, meaning the `name` attribute will be stored as a string of up to 255 characters in the database."
"In the ORM example, what does `Column(Integer)` signify for the `age` attribute?","In the ORM example `age = Column(Integer)`, `Column(Integer)` signifies that the `age` attribute will be stored as an integer type in the database. `Column` indicates it's a database column, and `Integer` specifies its data type."
What type of code is typically injected by an attacker in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack?,"In a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack, the attacker typically injects malicious **JavaScript** code."
Why would a Content Security Policy (CSP) disallow all inline scripts?,"A **Content Security Policy (CSP)** would disallow all inline scripts as a defense mechanism against XSS because inline scripts are a common vector for injecting malicious code. By disallowing them, the policy prevents any script embedded directly within the HTML from executing, forcing all scripts to be loaded from external, trusted sources, which can be more easily controlled and validated."
