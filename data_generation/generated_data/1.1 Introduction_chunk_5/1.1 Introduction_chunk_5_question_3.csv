What is the design principle of Least of Privilege?,The design principle of Least of Privilege dictates that each entity should be given the minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task. This means granting privileges only when needed and revoking them after use.
How should privileges be assigned according to the Least of Privilege principle?,"According to the Least of Privilege principle, privileges should be assigned carefully by giving each entity the minimal permissions required to complete its task. Privileges should be granted only when they are needed and subsequently revoked after their use."
What is the benefit of a program having less privilege?,The benefit of a program having less privilege is that it can do less harm if it goes awry or becomes subverted. This minimizes the potential damage an attacker or a malfunctioning program can cause.
What is the risk of granting unnecessary permissions?,The risk of granting unnecessary permissions is that a malicious entity could abuse those permissions to perform an attack. This expands the attack surface and potential impact of a compromise.
Provide an example of applying the Least of Privilege principle in an operating system.,"An example of applying the Least of Privilege principle in an operating system (OS) is to never perform personal activities using a root or admin account. These accounts typically have extensive privileges, and using them for routine tasks increases the risk of accidental damage or malicious exploitation."
How does a photo editing application demonstrate the Least of Privilege principle on a smartphone?,"A photo editing application on a smartphone demonstrates the Least of Privilege principle by only being allowed access to the gallery. It is not granted access to unrelated resources like the microphone or location, as these are not necessary for its core function."
"Explain the concept of ""minimal permissions"" in the context of the Least of Privilege principle.","In the context of the Least of Privilege principle, ""minimal permissions"" refers to the absolute fewest rights or access levels an entity requires to perform its specific function and nothing more. This ensures that the entity cannot access, modify, or delete resources beyond what is strictly necessary for its intended operation."
Why is it important to revoke privileges after use?,"It is important to revoke privileges after use to minimize the window of opportunity for misuse or compromise. Once a task requiring specific privileges is complete, those privileges are no longer needed, and keeping them active unnecessarily increases the risk of them being exploited by an attacker or a faulty process."
What is the primary objective of the Least of Privilege design principle?,"The primary objective of the Least of Privilege design principle is to limit the potential damage that can be caused by a security breach, error, or malicious activity by restricting entities to only the permissions essential for their tasks."
Can you give a general guideline for implementing the Least of Privilege?,"A general guideline for implementing the Least of Privilege is to always default to denying access and then explicitly grant only the specific permissions that are absolutely necessary for an entity to perform its function, ensuring these permissions are temporary if possible."
What is the Design Principle of Separation of Privilege?,"The Design Principle of Separation of Privilege involves splitting responsibility such that to perform a privileged action, multiple parties must work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision."
How does Separation of Privilege minimize risk?,"Separation of Privilege minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. This distributed control prevents a single point of failure or malicious intent from fully compromising a system."
Describe an example of Separation of Privilege in a financial system.,"In a financial system, an example of Separation of Privilege is when transferring large sums of money. This action requires approval from an employee, who acts as the initiator, and additional approval from a manager, who acts as the reviewer. This ensures no single person can unilaterally approve large transfers."
How is deployment handled under the Separation of Privilege principle in software development?,"Under the Separation of Privilege principle in software development, a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, deployment is handled by a separate operations team, ensuring that the person who writes the code is not the sole individual responsible for releasing it to live environments."
"What is the core idea behind ""splitting the responsibility"" in Separation of Privilege?","The core idea behind ""splitting the responsibility"" in Separation of Privilege is to distribute the authority and control required for critical actions among multiple independent entities. This prevents any single entity from having unilateral power, thereby reducing the risk of error, fraud, or compromise."
"What kind of actions are considered ""privileged actions"" in the context of Separation of Privilege?","In the context of Separation of Privilege, ""privileged actions"" are those operations that have significant impact on the system's security, integrity, or availability, such as transferring large sums of money, deploying code to production, or making critical configuration changes. These actions require heightened scrutiny and control."
What is the potential danger if a single entity has full control over critical processes?,"If a single entity has full control over critical processes, the potential danger is a heightened risk of misuse, error, or compromise. A single point of failure or a single malicious actor could unilaterally subvert the process, leading to significant security or operational issues."
How does Separation of Privilege contribute to system security?,"Separation of Privilege contributes to system security by creating a system of checks and balances. It requires collusion among multiple parties to perform a malicious act or bypass controls, making it significantly harder for a single individual to compromise the system."
Can Separation of Privilege be applied to both human roles and automated processes?,"While the examples provided focus on human roles (employee, manager, developer, operations team), the principle of requiring multiple parties to work together for a privileged action can conceptually extend to automated processes where different automated services or components must independently approve or contribute to a critical operation."
What is the difference between Least of Privilege and Separation of Privilege?,"Least of Privilege focuses on granting each entity the minimal permissions needed for its task, limiting what any single entity can do. Separation of Privilege, on the other hand, focuses on requiring multiple distinct entities to collaborate to perform a single privileged action, preventing any single entity from having complete control over critical processes."
What is the Design Principle of Defense in Depth?,The Design Principle of Defense in Depth involves layering multiple types of defenses together to protect a system. This approach aims to increase the difficulty of attacking the entire system by providing redundant security measures.
What are some characteristics or implications of implementing Defense in Depth?,"Some characteristics or implications of implementing Defense in Depth include an increase in the difficulty of attacking the entire system. However, the implementation cost could be high, and the entire effectiveness is often less than the sum of all individual defenses, as there can even be conflicts among them."
What are the different layers of Defense in Depth mentioned in the document?,"The different layers of Defense in Depth mentioned are: End uses, Implementations, Protocols and Policies, and Cryptographic primitives."
"Provide examples of defenses at the ""End uses"" layer in Defense in Depth.","Examples of defenses at the ""End uses"" layer in Defense in Depth include password managers and company policies. These measures focus on user behavior and organizational guidelines."
"What types of defenses are found at the ""Implementations"" layer in Defense in Depth?","At the ""Implementations"" layer in Defense in Depth, types of defenses include firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These are typically software or hardware components designed to protect the system's operational environment."
"Give examples of security measures at the ""Protocols and Policies"" layer in Defense in Depth.","Examples of security measures at the ""Protocols and Policies"" layer in Defense in Depth include TLS (Transport Layer Security), IPsec (Internet Protocol Security), and access control mechanisms. These define how data is transmitted and who can access resources."
"What are ""Cryptographic primitives"" in the context of Defense in Depth?","In the context of Defense in Depth, ""Cryptographic primitives"" are fundamental cryptographic algorithms and functions that form the lowest layer of security. Examples include RSA, DSS (Digital Signature Standard), and SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1), which are used for encryption, digital signatures, and hashing."
Why is Defense in Depth considered a robust security strategy?,"Defense in Depth is considered a robust security strategy because it increases the difficulty of attacking the entire system by requiring an attacker to bypass multiple, independent security controls. Even if one defense fails, others are in place to prevent or detect a breach."
What is a potential drawback of implementing Defense in Depth?,"A potential drawback of implementing Defense in Depth is that the implementation cost could be high due to the need for multiple security technologies and their integration. Additionally, the overall effectiveness might not simply be the sum of individual defenses, and conflicts can arise between different security measures."
How does layering defenses help in a Defense in Depth strategy?,"Layering defenses in a Defense in Depth strategy helps by creating multiple barriers that an attacker must overcome. If one layer is breached, subsequent layers provide additional protection, making it more difficult and time-consuming for an attacker to reach their target."
What is the Design Principle of Security Through Obscurity?,"The Design Principle of Security Through Obscurity involves relying on secrecy or concealing the details of a system or its components to provide security. The idea is that if an attacker does not know how a system works, they are less likely to compromise it."
Why is Security Through Obscurity often regarded as insufficient for security?,"Security Through Obscurity is often regarded as insufficient and unreliable as the sole basis for security because attackers may reverse-engineer or uncover hidden details. Relying solely on obscurity cannot effectively keep attackers away, as skilled adversaries can often discover the concealed information."
Provide an example of a company relying on Security Through Obscurity with sensitive files.,"An example of a company relying on Security Through Obscurity with sensitive files is when they hide these files behind obscure URLs without implementing proper authentication. An attacker could still discover the URL through guessing, web crawling, or by analyzing server logs."
How does code obfuscation relate to Security Through Obscurity?,"Code obfuscation relates to Security Through Obscurity as it is a technique used by software developers to hide the details of source code and potential vulnerabilities. The goal is to make the code difficult to understand and analyze, thereby relying on the obscurity of its internal workings for security."
What is the limitation of using code obfuscation for security?,"The limitation of using code obfuscation for security is that a skilled attacker can deobfuscate or analyze the binary to discover the vulnerabilities. Obfuscation only makes discovery harder, but does not fundamentally remove the vulnerabilities or prevent a determined attacker from finding them."
"What is the fundamental flaw in the assumption that ""if an attacker does not know how a system works, they are less likely to compromise it""?","The fundamental flaw in the assumption that ""if an attacker does not know how a system works, they are less likely to compromise it"" is that attackers are often capable of reverse-engineering or uncovering hidden details through various means, such as reconnaissance, analysis of system behavior, or exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in similar systems."
Why should Security Through Obscurity not be the sole basis for security?,"Security Through Obscurity should not be the sole basis for security because it provides a false sense of security. Attackers are persistent and resourceful; they can often bypass obscurity measures, meaning that underlying vulnerabilities remain exploitable even if initially hidden."
"What methods might an attacker use to discover ""obscure URLs"" for sensitive files?","An attacker might use several methods to discover ""obscure URLs"" for sensitive files, including guessing common URL patterns, performing web crawling to discover links, or analyzing server logs which might inadvertently expose these URLs."
"Does Security Through Obscurity offer any value at all, even if not as a primary security measure?","The document states that Security Through Obscurity is ""often regarded as insufficient and unreliable as the sole basis for security."" It does not explicitly mention any value it offers, even as a secondary measure, focusing instead on its unreliability."
What is the primary risk associated with relying on secrecy for system security?,"The primary risk associated with relying on secrecy for system security is that it is an unreliable defense. Attackers can often discover the concealed details through reverse-engineering or other methods, rendering the secrecy ineffective and leaving the system vulnerable to attack."
"What is Kerckhoffs's Principle and Shannon's Maxim, also known as ""the enemy knows the system""?","Kerckhoffs's Principle and Shannon's Maxim, encapsulated by the phrase ""the enemy knows the system,"" states that the security of a system should not depend on the secrecy of its design or algorithms. Instead, it is always necessary to assume that the attacker knows every detail about the system, including algorithms, hardware, and defenses."
"How does assuming ""the enemy knows the system"" make a system resilient?","Assuming ""the enemy knows the system"" makes a system resilient because it forces designers to build security based on robust principles that hold even if the design or implementation becomes public knowledge. This means the security relies on factors like the secrecy of keys, rather than the obscurity of the mechanism."
What is the role of cryptographic keys in ensuring security according to Kerckhoffs's Principle?,"According to Kerckhoffs's Principle, in cryptography, the secrecy of the cryptographic key is the only thing that ensures security. If the key is kept confidential, the system remains secure, even if all other aspects of the cryptographic algorithm and system design are publicly known."
Who was Auguste Kerckhoffs?,Auguste Kerckhoffs was a Dutch linguist and cryptographer.
Who was Claude Shannon?,"Claude Shannon was an American mathematician and cryptographer, known as the Father of information theory."
"What should a system's security *not* depend on, according to Kerckhoffs's Principle?","According to Kerckhoffs's Principle, a system's security should not depend on the secrecy of its design or algorithms."
What details about a system should designers assume an attacker knows?,"Designers should always assume that an attacker knows every detail about the system they are designing, including its algorithms, hardware, and defenses."
How does Kerckhoffs's Principle contrast with Security Through Obscurity?,"Kerckhoffs's Principle directly contrasts with Security Through Obscurity. While Security Through Obscurity relies on concealing system details for security, Kerckhoffs's Principle asserts that security should *not* depend on such secrecy, instead assuming full attacker knowledge and relying on other factors like key confidentiality."
What is the practical implication of Kerckhoffs's Principle for cryptographic algorithm design?,"The practical implication of Kerckhoffs's Principle for cryptographic algorithm design is that the algorithms themselves should be open to public scrutiny and analysis. Their security should derive solely from the secrecy of the keys, allowing for rigorous peer review and confidence in their strength."
Why is it important for a system to be resilient even if its design becomes public knowledge?,"It is important for a system to be resilient even if its design becomes public knowledge because, according to Kerckhoffs's Principle, it is necessary to assume an attacker knows every detail. Designing for this scenario ensures the system's security holds up against sophisticated adversaries who can reverse-engineer or discover hidden information."
