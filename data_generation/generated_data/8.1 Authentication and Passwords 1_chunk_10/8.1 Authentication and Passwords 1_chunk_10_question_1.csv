What additional factors can be considered during the authentication process?,"Other factors that can be taken into account when conducting authentication include a user's location. For example, Alice's location can be used as an authentication factor."
How can Alice's location be determined for authentication purposes?,Alice's location can be determined if she carries a cellphone equipped with a GPS chip. Her cellphone company's computer system can then provide her current latitude and longitude.
Describe a scenario where Alice's location is used for ATM withdrawal authentication.,"When Alice requests to withdraw money from an ATM, her bank can query her cellphone company's computer system to ascertain her current location. If the cellphone company's system responds with a latitude and longitude that matches the expected location of the ATM, the bank can then approve the withdrawal request."
How can location-based authentication prevent fraudulent ATM withdrawals?,"If an individual's ATM card and PIN are stolen and used by a malicious actor, taking the individual's location (specifically, the location of their cell phone) into account can help thwart such a fraudulent withdrawal request. This is because the location of the card would likely not match the location of the legitimate cardholder's cell phone."
What happens if an attacker tries to use a stolen ATM card while the legitimate owner still has their cellphone?,"If an attacker attempts to use a stolen ATM card at an ATM while the legitimate owner, Alice, still possesses her cellphone, the location of the ATM will not correspond to the location of Alice's cell phone. In such a scenario, the bank will deny the withdrawal request, unless Alice and her cell phone are being held captive directly in front of the ATM."
What security advice is given regarding keeping a cellphone and ATM card?,"It is advantageous for an individual, such as Alice, to keep her cellphone and her ATM card in different places. She should not, for instance, store both items together in her purse, as this reduces the effectiveness of location-based authentication in preventing fraud."
"Beyond people authenticating to computers, what other authentication scenarios exist on the Internet?","On the Internet, computers frequently interact with other computers. In these interactions, computers may need to authenticate themselves to each other because not all computers can be trusted equally. This extends authentication beyond people authenticating to computers."
What are the three general types of authentication supported by protocols for computer-to-computer authentication?,"Protocols designed for computer-to-computer authentication generally support three types of authentication: client authentication, server authentication, and mutual authentication."
Define client authentication in the context of computer-to-computer interactions.,Client authentication involves the server verifying the identity of the client. This ensures that the client attempting to access a service or resource is who they claim to be.
Define server authentication in the context of computer-to-computer interactions.,Server authentication involves the client verifying the identity of the server. This ensures that the client is connecting to a legitimate server and not a fraudulent one.
Define mutual authentication in the context of computer-to-computer interactions.,Mutual authentication involves both the client and the server verifying each other's identity. This provides a higher level of security by ensuring both parties in a communication are legitimate.
"Which common internet protocols support client, server, and mutual authentication?","TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols, which are used in HTTPS, support client, server, and mutual authentication over the internet."
"What factors determine whether client, server, or mutual authentication is used?","The choice of whether client, server, or mutual authentication is performed often depends upon the specific nature of the application and the expected security threats it faces."
Why do many e-commerce websites primarily use server authentication?,"Many e-commerce websites provide server authentication, particularly when a user is about to make a purchase. This is crucial because they want to prevent the client from submitting sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to a spoofed or impostor website, thereby protecting the user's financial data."
What makes spoofed web sites a significant security threat?,"Spoofed web sites are considered a significant security threat because they do not cost much to set up, making them easily deployable by malicious actors to deceive users and steal information."
What is the primary purpose of considering Alice's location in authentication?,"The primary purpose of considering Alice's location in authentication is to add an additional layer of security that can help prevent fraudulent activities, especially in scenarios like ATM withdrawals where physical presence is expected."
How does a GPS chip in a cellphone contribute to authentication security?,A GPS chip in a cellphone allows for the precise determination of the phone's geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). This location data can then be used as an authentication factor to verify a user's presence at an expected location for a transaction.
What information does a cellphone company's computer system provide for location-based authentication?,"For location-based authentication, a cellphone company's computer system can provide the current latitude and longitude coordinates of a user's cellphone, which indicates their geographical position."
"In the ATM withdrawal example, what is the bank's role in location-based authentication?","In the ATM withdrawal example, the bank's role is to initiate a query to the cellphone company's computer system to determine the user's current location. The bank then compares this received location data with the expected location of the ATM to decide whether to approve the withdrawal request."
What is the consequence if the cellphone company's computer system does not respond with a matching location during an ATM transaction?,"If the cellphone company's computer system does not respond with a latitude and longitude that corresponds to the expected location of the ATM, the bank will deny the withdrawal request, assuming a potential fraudulent activity."
Why is it important to consider factors beyond just card and PIN for authentication?,"It is important to consider factors beyond just a card and PIN for authentication because these traditional credentials can be stolen. Incorporating additional factors, such as location, provides a more robust security measure against fraudulent use of stolen credentials."
What is the specific role of Alice's cell phone location in thwarting fraudulent withdrawals?,"Alice's cell phone location specifically helps thwart fraudulent withdrawals by providing an independent verification of her physical presence. If her ATM card and PIN are stolen, the location of her cell phone can be checked against the ATM's location to detect and prevent unauthorized transactions."
Under what specific condition would the bank still deny a withdrawal request even if Alice's cellphone is with her but an attacker is using her card?,"The bank would deny a withdrawal request if an attacker uses Alice's card at an ATM and the location of that ATM does not correspond to the location of Alice's cell phone, assuming Alice still has her phone."
What is the exception to the rule that a bank will deny a withdrawal if ATM and cellphone locations don't match?,"The exception to the rule that a bank will deny a withdrawal if ATM and cellphone locations don't match is if the legitimate user, Alice, and her cell phone are being held captive directly in front of the ATM by an attacker."
Why is it generally a bad idea to keep both an ATM card and a cellphone in the same place?,"It is generally a bad idea to keep both an ATM card and a cellphone in the same place because if both are stolen together, the location-based authentication mechanism, which relies on the cellphone's location, would be compromised, making it easier for a thief to bypass security measures."
