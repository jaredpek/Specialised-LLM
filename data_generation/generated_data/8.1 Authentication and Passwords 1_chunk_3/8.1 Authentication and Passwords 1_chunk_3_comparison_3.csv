What is the primary question authentication aims to answer when Bob communicates with Alice?,"The primary question authentication aims to answer when Bob communicates with Alice is how Bob can be sure that he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity, and impersonation is someone trying to pretend to be another person."
What are the three types of methods Bob can use to authenticate Alice's identity?,"Bob can authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of three types of methods: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity."
Explain how passwords serve as a 'something you know' authentication method.,"Passwords serve as a 'something you know' authentication method because they are a secret only the legitimate user, such as Alice, should know. If Alice produces the right password, then Bob can assume he is communicating with Alice. 'Something you know' is one of three general types of authentication methods, with authentication being the process of verifying identity."
What are the advantages of using password schemes for authentication?,"Password schemes offer several advantages for authentication. One advantage is their simplicity to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics. Another advantage is that password security systems are simple for users to understand. Authentication is the process of verifying identity, and biometrics refers to authentication methods based on unique biological characteristics."
What are the disadvantages of using password security systems?,"There are several disadvantages to using password security systems. Primarily, most users do not choose strong passwords, which are hard for attackers to guess. Users commonly select passwords that are simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. A strong password is one that is difficult for attackers to guess or crack, while a weak password is one that is easily compromised."
How do hackers typically crack passwords?,"Hackers typically crack passwords by not directly trying various combinations on applications. Instead, they commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. Systems normally use common standard hash functions to generate these hashes. Attackers then use password cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords to crack these hashes offline. If a user's password hash appears in such a dictionary, the password is compromised. A password hash is the output of a hash function applied to a password, and a password cracking program is a tool designed to guess passwords, often using a dictionary of common passwords."
Describe the function of password-cracking programs.,"Password-cracking programs are used by attackers to try many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. Such programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system. Attackers typically need only one valid username and password to gain access to a system. A password cracking program is a tool designed to guess passwords, often using a dictionary of common passwords."
How do user password choices impact the security of password systems?,"User password choices significantly impact the security of password systems. Most users do not choose strong passwords, opting instead for simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. This makes passwords relatively easy to crack for attackers using password-cracking programs, unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for such programs to guess. A strong password is one that is difficult for attackers to guess or crack, while a weak password is one that is easily compromised."
Compare how hackers crack passwords offline versus attempting to crack them directly on applications.,"Hackers do not typically go to applications and try various combinations of passwords directly. Instead, they commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. They then use password cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords to crack these hashes offline. This offline cracking method is efficient because they store password hashes in dictionaries and can determine if a password is compromised if its hash appears in their dictionary. A password hash is the output of a hash function applied to a password, and a password cracking program is a tool designed to guess passwords, often using a dictionary of common passwords."
Compare the simplicity of implementing password schemes with biometrics as authentication mechanisms.,"Password schemes are simple to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics.
