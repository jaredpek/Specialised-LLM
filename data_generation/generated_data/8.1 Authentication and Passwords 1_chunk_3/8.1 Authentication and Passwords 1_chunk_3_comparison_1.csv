Compare the primary goal of authentication with the threat it aims to mitigate.,"The primary goal of authentication is to verify a user's identity, ensuring that communication is with the intended party. For example, if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, authentication ensures he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her. The threat it aims to mitigate is **impersonation**, which is when an unauthorized entity attempts to assume the identity of a legitimate user."
"What are the differences between ""something you know"" and other types of authentication methods mentioned?","The document mentions three types of authentication methods: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" ""Something you know"" refers to a secret that only the legitimate user should possess, such as a secret password. The document does not elaborate on the specific characteristics of ""something you have"" or ""something you are,"" but it does mention **biometrics** as another authentication mechanism, which would fall under ""something you are"" (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition). The key difference highlighted is that ""something you know"" relies on shared secret knowledge."
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using passwords for authentication.,"Passwords, which are a form of ""something you know"" authentication, have both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that **password schemes** are simple to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms like biometrics. Another advantage is their simplicity for users to understand. However, a significant disadvantage is that most users do not choose strong passwords, making them easy for attackers to guess. These weak passwords often consist of common names, dictionary words, street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases."
What are the differences in implementation complexity between password schemes and biometrics?,"Password schemes are described as simple to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics. **Password schemes** are authentication methods that rely on a secret known only to the user, typically a password. **Biometrics** are authentication methods that rely on unique biological characteristics of an individual. The document explicitly states that the simplicity of implementation is an advantage of password schemes over biometrics."
Compare strong passwords with weak passwords in terms of security.,"Strong passwords are those that are difficult for attackers to guess or crack, while weak passwords are easy to guess. Users often choose weak passwords, which are simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. These weak passwords make systems vulnerable to **password-cracking programs**. Strong passwords, conversely, are those that users are somehow forced to choose, making them hard for such programs to guess and thus enhancing security."
What is the difference between how hackers typically crack passwords and how a user might assume they do?,"Hackers typically do not go directly to applications to try various combinations of passwords. Instead, they commonly sniff and extract the **password hash** over the internet as a user logs in. A **password hash** is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password, used for storage and verification rather than storing the plaintext password. Once they have the hash, they write or use a password cracking program with a dictionary of common passwords to crack it offline. They store these password hashes in dictionaries. If a user's password hash appears in such a dictionary, it indicates the password has been compromised."
"Compare the role of a ""secret only she should know"" in authentication with a publicly known identifier.","In authentication, a ""secret only she should know,"" such as a secret password, is the core component for verifying identity. This secret is private and, if correctly produced, allows the system (e.g., Bob) to assume communication with the legitimate user (e.g., Alice). The document does not explicitly discuss publicly known identifiers, but by contrast, a secret's value lies in its exclusivity. If a piece of information were publicly known, it could not serve as a secret for authentication, as anyone could use it to impersonate the legitimate user."
What are the differences between an attacker trying passwords directly on an application and using password-cracking programs?,"Attackers typically do not try various combinations of passwords directly on applications. Instead, they use **password-cracking programs**. These programs work by sniffing and extracting the **password hash** (the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password) over the internet during login. They then use these programs offline, often with dictionaries of common passwords, to determine the original password from its hash. This method allows them to crack passwords without directly interacting with the application's login interface."
"Compare the ease of understanding for users of password security systems versus other, more complex authentication mechanisms.","Password security systems are simple for users to understand. This is highlighted as an advantage of using passwords for authentication. While the document mentions other authentication mechanisms like biometrics, it specifically points out that password systems' simplicity for users is a key benefit. This implies that other, more complex mechanisms might require more effort or knowledge for users to comprehend and utilize effectively."
What are the differences between a password hash and a plaintext password in the context of hacker attacks?,"In the context of hacker attacks, hackers commonly sniff and extract the **password hash** over the internet as a user logs in, rather than the plaintext password itself. A **password hash** is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password. Systems normally use these hash functions to store and verify passwords securely, meaning the actual plaintext password is not stored directly. Hackers then use password cracking programs to try and determine the original plaintext password from the extracted hash, often by comparing it against dictionaries of common password hashes. If the password hash appears in their dictionary, the password is compromised."
Compare the effectiveness of password-cracking programs against randomly generated passwords versus common dictionary words.,"Password-cracking programs are highly effective against passwords that are simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. These programs are designed to use dictionaries of such common passwords to quickly determine the original password from its hash. The document implies that passwords are ""relatively easy to crack"" unless users are ""forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess,"" which would include randomly generated or complex passwords not found in common dictionaries."
"What are the differences between the ""something you know"" and ""something you have"" authentication factors?","""Something you know"" is an authentication factor where the user proves their identity by providing a secret piece of information that only they should know, such as a password. ""Something you have"" is another authentication factor mentioned, but the document does not provide specific details or examples for it. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, the key difference is that ""something you know"" relies on cognitive knowledge or memory of a secret, while ""something you have"" would imply possession of a physical or digital token."
"Compare the ""something you know"" and ""something you are"" authentication factors.","""Something you know"" is an authentication factor where the user proves their identity by providing a secret piece of information that only they should know, such as a password. ""Something you are"" is another authentication factor mentioned, and the document provides **biometrics** as an example of an ""other authentication mechanism"" that would fall under this category. Biometrics involve unique biological characteristics. Thus, ""something you know"" relies on secret knowledge, while ""something you are"" relies on inherent personal attributes."
What are the differences between the security implications of users choosing strong passwords versus not choosing strong passwords?,"When users do not choose strong passwords, which are often simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, street names, or easy-to-guess terms, it creates a significant security vulnerability. Such weak passwords are easy for attackers to guess and for **password-cracking programs** to determine. Conversely, if users are somehow forced to choose strong passwords, these passwords become hard for password-cracking programs to guess, thereby enhancing the security of the system and making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access."
Compare the process of authenticating Alice using a password with the general concept of authentication.,"The general concept of authentication is to verify an entity's identity, ensuring communication is with the legitimate party and not an impersonator. Authenticating Alice using a password is a specific method under the ""something you know"" category. In this process, Bob asks Alice for a secret password only she should know. If Alice produces the correct password, Bob can then assume he is communicating with the legitimate Alice. This specific method fulfills the general goal of authentication by relying on a shared secret."
What are the differences between a password cracking program's approach to gaining access and a brute-force attack on an application?,"A password cracking program's approach involves sniffing and extracting the **password hash** (the output of a common standard hash function) over the internet during login. These programs then work offline, using dictionaries of common passwords to try and determine the original password from its hash. This is distinct from a brute-force attack on an application, which would involve repeatedly trying various password combinations directly against the application's login interface. The document explicitly states that hackers ""don't go to the applications and try various combo of your passwords!"" but rather use the hash-based, offline cracking method."
"Compare the ease of cracking passwords when users choose common words versus when they choose complex, non-dictionary terms.","Passwords chosen from common words, such as common names, dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases, are relatively easy to crack. **Password-cracking programs** are specifically designed to leverage dictionaries containing these common words and their concatenations to quickly determine the original password from its hash. Conversely, if users choose complex, non-dictionary terms, especially if they are ""forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess,"" these passwords become significantly more difficult to crack, enhancing security."
What are the differences between the information hackers extract during login and the information they use for offline cracking?,"During login, hackers commonly sniff and extract the **password hash** over the internet. A **password hash** is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password. This hash is not the plaintext password itself. For offline cracking, hackers use this extracted password hash in conjunction with a **password cracking program** and dictionaries of common passwords. The program attempts to reverse-engineer the password from the hash by comparing it against pre-computed hashes of common words. So, the extracted information is the hash, and the information used for cracking includes the hash, the cracking program, and dictionaries."
Compare the security of a system where password hashes are stored in dictionaries versus one where they are not.,"The document states that hackers store password hashes in dictionaries. If a user's password hash appears in such a dictionary, it means the password is compromised (""you are toast!""). This is because hackers use these dictionaries, which contain pre-computed hashes of common passwords, to quickly identify the original password from an extracted hash. Conversely, if a password hash is not present in such a dictionary, it significantly increases the difficulty for an attacker to crack the password using dictionary attacks, thereby reducing the immediate security risk."
What are the differences between the user's role in password security and the system's role?,"The user's role in password security primarily involves choosing a strong password. The document highlights that a major disadvantage is that ""most users do not choose strong passwords,"" often opting for simple, easy-to-guess terms. This directly impacts the system's vulnerability. The system's role, on the other hand, involves using common standard hash functions to protect passwords (by storing hashes instead of plaintext) and, ideally, implementing mechanisms to force users to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess."
Compare the simplicity of password systems for users with their inherent security vulnerabilities due to user behavior.,"Password security systems are simple for users to understand, which is an advantage. However, this simplicity for users often leads to inherent security vulnerabilities because most users do not choose strong passwords. Instead, they opt for simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. This user behavior makes passwords relatively easy to crack by attackers using password-cracking programs, despite the system's underlying use of hash functions."
What are the differences between the initial authentication question and the methods used to answer it?,"The initial authentication question is: ""if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, how can he be sure that he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her?"" This question defines the core problem authentication aims to solve. The methods used to answer it are the various authentication factors, which include ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" For example, ""something you know"" methods, like passwords, are used to verify Alice's identity and thus answer the initial question."
"Compare the general method of ""something you know"" authentication with the specific example of passwords.","The general method of ""something you know"" authentication refers to proving identity by providing a secret that only the legitimate user should know. Passwords are the first general method and a specific example of ""something you know"" authentication. When Alice produces the right password, Bob can assume he is communicating with Alice. Thus, passwords are a concrete implementation of the broader ""something you know"" principle."
What are the differences between the ease of implementation of password schemes and their susceptibility to weak user choices?,"Password schemes are simple to implement, which is considered an advantage compared to other authentication mechanisms. This refers to the technical effort required to set up and deploy a password-based system. However, their susceptibility to weak user choices is a significant disadvantage. Users frequently choose weak passwords (common names, dictionary words, etc.), which are easy for attackers to guess and crack using password-cracking programs. So, while the system itself is easy to implement, its security is often undermined by user behavior."
Compare the security of a system that forces strong passwords with one that allows weak passwords.,"A system that forces users to choose strong passwords is significantly more secure than one that allows weak passwords. The document states that passwords are ""relatively easy to crack, unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess."" This implies that by enforcing strong password policies, the system makes it much harder for attackers to use password-cracking programs, which rely on dictionaries of common and easy-to-guess passwords, to compromise accounts."
What are the differences between the information required by an attacker to gain system access and the information they typically target?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password. The information they typically target, however, is the **password hash** rather than the plaintext password. Hackers commonly sniff and extract the password hash over the internet during login. A **password hash** is the output of a common standard hash function. They then use password-cracking programs to derive the plaintext password from the hash, which, combined with a username, grants them system access."
Compare the prevalence of passwords as an authentication method with the need for proper password management.,"Passwords are so prevalently used as an authentication method that the document states there will be further study on how to properly build a password management system. This highlights a significant difference: despite their widespread use and simplicity, the inherent vulnerabilities stemming from user choices (weak passwords) and hacker techniques (cracking password hashes) necessitate robust password management systems to mitigate risks and ensure security."
"What are the differences between the ""something you know"" factor and the general concept of identity verification?","Identity verification is the overarching goal of authentication, which seeks to confirm that an entity is who or what it claims to be, preventing impersonation. The ""something you know"" factor is one specific category of methods used to achieve identity verification. It relies on the user providing a secret piece of information (like a password) that only they should know. So, ""something you know"" is a means to an end, with identity verification being that end."
Compare the simplicity of password schemes for implementation with the complexity of building a secure password management system.,"Password schemes are simple to implement, which is an advantage. This refers to the basic setup of using passwords for authentication. However, the document also states that passwords are so prevalently used that there will be further study on how to properly build a password management system. This implies that while the core concept is simple, building a *secure* and robust **password management system** (which would encompass policies, storage, and handling of passwords to protect against various attacks) is a more complex endeavor, necessary due to the inherent vulnerabilities of simple password schemes."
"What are the differences between a password being ""hard for attackers to guess"" and ""hard for users to remember""?","The document emphasizes that strong passwords are ""hard for attackers to guess"" and ""hard for such password-cracking programs to guess."" This refers to their resistance against automated cracking attempts and dictionary attacks. While the document doesn't explicitly state that strong passwords are ""hard for users to remember,"" it implies a trade-off by noting that users ""do not choose strong passwords"" and instead opt for ""simple concatenations"" of easy-to-guess terms. This suggests that what makes a password hard for attackers (complexity, randomness) often makes it harder for users to recall, leading to the security vulnerability."
Compare the security risk of a password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary with a password hash not being present.,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the password has been compromised, and the user is vulnerable (""you are toast!""). This is because hackers use these dictionaries, which contain pre-computed hashes of common passwords, to quickly identify the original password from an extracted hash. Conversely, if a password hash is not present in such a dictionary, it significantly increases the difficulty for an attacker to crack the password using dictionary attacks, thereby reducing the immediate security risk."
What are the differences between the general concept of authentication and the specific method of using a secret password?,"The general concept of authentication is to verify an entity's identity to ensure communication is with the legitimate party and not an impersonator. The specific method of using a secret password falls under the ""something you know"" category of authentication. In this method, the user provides a secret known only to them (the password), and if it's correct, their identity is verified. So, while authentication is the goal, using a secret password is one particular mechanism to achieve that goal."
Compare the effectiveness of password-cracking programs against 10-20% of system accounts versus a smaller percentage.,"Password-cracking programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system. This indicates a significant level of effectiveness, highlighting a substantial vulnerability if users choose weak passwords. A smaller percentage would imply a more secure system, likely due to users choosing stronger passwords or the implementation of more robust security measures that make cracking more difficult. The 10-20% figure underscores the widespread issue of weak password choices."
What are the differences between the information needed for an attacker to gain access and the information typically stored by systems for password verification?,"An attacker typically needs one valid username and password to gain access to a system. Systems, however, normally use a **common standard hash function** to process passwords, storing the resulting **password hash** rather than the plaintext password itself. A **password hash** is a one-way cryptographic function output. This means that while the attacker needs the original password, the system stores a transformed version (the hash) for verification, making it harder for attackers to directly obtain plaintext passwords even if they compromise the storage."
Compare the security of passwords chosen by users versus passwords enforced by system policies.,"Passwords chosen by users are often weak, consisting of common names, dictionary words, street names, or easy-to-guess terms, making them easy for attackers to guess and crack. This represents a significant security vulnerability. In contrast, passwords enforced by system policies, which ""force users to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess,"" lead to significantly higher security. Such policies mitigate the risk of weak user choices and make it much more difficult for attackers to compromise accounts."
"What are the differences between the ""something you know"" factor and the overall concept of authentication methods?","Authentication methods are the various techniques used to verify an entity's identity. The document lists three general types: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" The ""something you know"" factor is one specific category among these methods, characterized by relying on a secret piece of information (like a password) that only the legitimate user should know. Therefore, ""something you know"" is a subset or a specific type within the broader category of authentication methods."
Compare the simplicity of password systems for users with the complexity of hacker methods to crack them.,"Password security systems are simple for users to understand, which is an advantage. Users interact with them by simply providing a known secret. However, the methods hackers use to crack these passwords are more complex. Hackers don't simply try combinations on applications; instead, they sniff and extract **password hashes** (the output of a common standard hash function) during login. They then use specialized **password cracking programs** offline, often with dictionaries of common passwords, to determine the original password from its hash. This highlights a disparity between user-facing simplicity and the sophisticated, technical methods employed by attackers."
What are the differences between a password management system and a simple password authentication scheme?,"A simple password authentication scheme involves using a secret password as a ""something you know"" factor to verify identity. If the correct password is provided, the user is authenticated. A **password management system**, however, is a more comprehensive approach to handling passwords. The document states that passwords are so prevalently used that there will be further study on how to properly build such a system. This implies that a password management system goes beyond basic authentication to encompass best practices for password creation, storage, retrieval, and protection against various attacks, addressing the inherent vulnerabilities of simple password schemes."
Compare the security implications of storing plaintext passwords versus password hashes.,"The document implies that systems normally use a **common standard hash function** to generate and store **password hashes** rather than plaintext passwords. A **password hash** is the output of a one-way function, making it difficult to reverse-engineer the original password. Storing plaintext passwords would be a severe security vulnerability, as any compromise of the storage would immediately expose all user passwords. By storing hashes, even if hackers extract them, they still need to use password-cracking programs to attempt to derive the original passwords, adding a layer of security."
What are the differences between an attacker's need for a username and password and their ability to obtain them?,"An attacker typically needs only one valid username and password to gain access to a system. Their ability to obtain these credentials often involves exploiting user behavior and system vulnerabilities. They don't usually try combinations on applications directly. Instead, they commonly sniff and extract **password hashes** (the output of a common standard hash function) over the internet during login. They then use **password-cracking programs** with dictionaries of common passwords to determine the original password from its hash, thereby fulfilling their need for a valid username and password."
Compare the general concept of authentication with the specific challenge of impersonation.,The general concept of authentication is the process of verifying an entity's identity. The specific challenge of **impersonation** is the threat that authentication aims to mitigate. Impersonation occurs when an unauthorized individual attempts to assume the identity of a legitimate user. The core question authentication seeks to answer is how to be sure one is communicating with the legitimate party and not someone trying to impersonate them.
What are the differences between the simplicity of password schemes for implementation and their potential for widespread compromise?,"Password schemes are simple to implement, which is an advantage. This refers to the ease of setting up the technical infrastructure for password-based authentication. However, their potential for widespread compromise stems from two main factors: users often choose weak passwords (common names, dictionary words, etc.), and attackers use efficient **password-cracking programs** that can determine 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system. This combination means that while easy to implement, password systems can be highly susceptible to large-scale breaches if not managed carefully."
"Compare the security of a password that is a common dictionary word with one that is a complex, unique phrase.","A password that is a common dictionary word is highly insecure because **password-cracking programs** are designed to use dictionaries of common words to quickly determine passwords from their hashes. Such passwords are easy for attackers to guess. In contrast, a complex, unique phrase, especially one that is ""hard for such password-cracking programs to guess,"" offers significantly higher security. The document implies that passwords are ""relatively easy to crack, unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess,"" which would include complex, unique phrases not found in common dictionaries."
What are the differences between the initial verification of identity and the ongoing communication after authentication?,"The initial verification of identity is the process of authentication itself, where a system (e.g., Bob) confirms that the communicating party (e.g., Alice) is who they claim to be, typically by providing a secret like a password. Once this initial verification is successful, and Bob assumes he is communicating with Alice, the ongoing communication can proceed. The document focuses on the initial verification aspect, ensuring the legitimacy of the party at the outset to prevent impersonation during subsequent interactions."
"Compare the general concept of a ""secret"" in authentication with a specific password.","The general concept of a ""secret"" in authentication refers to any piece of information that is known only to the legitimate user and is used to prove their identity. A specific password is a concrete example of such a secret, falling under the ""something you know"" category. If Alice produces the right password, which is a secret only she should know, Bob can assume he is communicating with her. Thus, a password is a particular type of secret used for authentication."
What are the differences between the security provided by a common standard hash function and the vulnerability introduced by weak passwords?,"A **common standard hash function** provides security by transforming a password into a **password hash**, which is stored instead of the plaintext password. This makes it harder for attackers to directly obtain passwords even if they compromise the storage. However, this security is significantly undermined by the vulnerability introduced by weak passwords. When users choose weak passwords (common names, dictionary words, etc.), their corresponding hashes are often easily found in hacker dictionaries or quickly cracked by **password-cracking programs**, effectively bypassing the protection offered by the hash function."
Compare the ease of cracking passwords for attackers with the difficulty for users to choose strong ones.,"Passwords are relatively easy for attackers to crack, especially when users choose weak ones like common names or dictionary words. Attackers use **password-cracking programs** that leverage dictionaries of common passwords and their hashes to quickly compromise accounts. This ease for attackers contrasts with the implied difficulty for users to choose strong passwords. The document notes that ""most users do not choose strong passwords"" and that passwords are hard to crack ""unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess,"" suggesting a challenge for users in creating truly secure passwords."
"What are the differences between the three types of authentication methods mentioned: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are""?","The document identifies three types of authentication methods: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" ""Something you know"" relies on a secret piece of information that only the legitimate user should know, such as a password. The document does not provide specific details for ""something you have"" or ""something you are,"" but it mentions **biometrics** as an example of an ""other authentication mechanism,"" which would typically fall under ""something you are"" (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition). Therefore, ""something you know"" is based on knowledge, while ""something you have"" implies possession, and ""something you are"" implies inherent biological attributes."
Compare the general concept of authentication with the specific scenario of Bob authenticating Alice.,"The general concept of authentication is the process of verifying an entity's identity to ensure communication is with the legitimate party and not an impersonator. The specific scenario of Bob authenticating Alice is a concrete example used to illustrate this concept. In this scenario, Bob needs to be sure he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her. This specific interaction demonstrates the practical application and necessity of authentication in a communication context."
What are the differences between the advantages of password schemes and the security challenges they face?,"The advantages of password schemes include their simplicity to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms like biometrics, and their simplicity for users to understand. These benefits contribute to their widespread use. However, password schemes face significant security challenges primarily due to user behavior: most users do not choose strong passwords, opting for easy-to-guess terms. This makes them highly susceptible to **password-cracking programs** that can easily determine a significant percentage of passwords in a system, undermining the inherent security of the scheme."
