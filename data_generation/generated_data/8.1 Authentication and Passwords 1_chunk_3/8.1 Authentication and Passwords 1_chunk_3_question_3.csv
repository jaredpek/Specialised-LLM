What is the core question authentication seeks to answer?,"Authentication, when explored with Alice and Bob, seeks to answer the question: if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, how can he be sure that he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her?"
"In the context of Alice and Bob, what is the primary concern addressed by authentication?","The primary concern addressed by authentication is ensuring that when Bob communicates with Alice, he can verify her identity and be certain he is not communicating with someone attempting to impersonate her."
How can Bob authenticate and verify Alice's identity?,"Bob may be able to authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of three types of methods: something you know, something you have, and something you are."
List the three types of methods used for identity verification in authentication.,"The three types of methods used for identity verification in authentication are: something you know, something you have, and something you are."
What are the categories of authentication methods Bob can use?,"The categories of authentication methods Bob can use to verify Alice's identity are: something you know, something you have, and something you are."
What is the first general method Bob can use to authenticate Alice?,"The first general method Bob can use to authenticate Alice is to ask her for some secret only she should know, such as her secret password. This falls under the 'something you know' category of authentication."
How does a password facilitate authentication?,"A password facilitates authentication by serving as a secret that only the legitimate user, such as Alice, should know. If Alice produces the correct password, Bob can then assume he is communicating with the authentic Alice."
What is a secret password in the context of authentication?,"In the context of authentication, a secret password is a piece of information that only the legitimate user should know. It is used as a method for one party to verify the identity of another, such as Bob verifying Alice's identity."
What assumption can Bob make if Alice provides the correct password?,"If Alice produces the right password, Bob can assume he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her."

What makes passwords easy for attackers to guess based on user choices?,"Passwords become easy for attackers to guess when users choose simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases, rather than strong, complex passwords."
How do hackers typically initiate the process of cracking passwords?,"Hackers typically initiate the process of cracking passwords by sniffing and extracting the 'password hash' over the internet as a user logs in. A password hash is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password, used by systems for storage."
Do hackers directly attempt various password combinations on applications?,"No, hackers typically do not go directly to applications to try various combinations of passwords. Instead, they commonly sniff and extract the 'password hash' over the internet as a user logs in."
"What is a ""password hash"" in the context of password cracking?","In the context of password cracking, a ""password hash"" is the output generated by a common standard hash function that systems use to store passwords. Hackers sniff and extract this hash over the internet when a user logs in, rather than the plain-text password itself."
What type of function do systems normally use for password hashes?,Systems normally use a common standard hash function to generate password hashes.
What is a password cracking program?,"A password cracking program is a tool that hackers write or use to attempt to determine passwords, often by comparing extracted password hashes against dictionaries of common passwords. These programs can crack passwords offline."
How do password cracking programs operate?,Password cracking programs operate by using dictionaries of common passwords to try and match against extracted password hashes. They perform this cracking process offline.
"What does it mean for hackers to ""crack Offline""?","For hackers to ""crack Offline"" means that after sniffing and extracting a password hash, they use a password cracking program to attempt to determine the original password without needing to interact further with the live application or system. This process is done using stored password hashes and dictionaries."
Where do hackers store password hashes?,"Hackers store password hashes in dictionaries, which they then use with password cracking programs to attempt to determine the original passwords."
What is the implication if a user's password hash appears in a dictionary used by hackers?,"If a user's password hash appears in a dictionary used by hackers, it implies that their password is easily guessable and compromised, meaning they are ""toast"" or vulnerable to unauthorized access."
What is the initial step hackers take to obtain password information?,"The initial step hackers take to obtain password information is to commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in."
What tools do attackers use to hack into accounts?,Attackers interested in hacking into somebody's account can use password-cracking programs. These programs try many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords.
How effective are password-cracking programs in determining usernames and passwords?,"Password-cracking programs can be quite effective, as they can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system."
What percentage of usernames and passwords can be determined by cracking programs?,Password cracking programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system.
What is the minimum requirement for an attacker to gain access to a system?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password."
Why are passwords generally easy to crack?,"Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess. This ease of cracking stems from users often choosing weak, predictable passwords."
How can passwords be made harder for cracking programs to guess?,"Passwords can be made harder for cracking programs to guess if users are somehow forced to choose strong passwords that are not simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, or easy-to-guess terms."
What is the role of user choice in password strength?,"User choice plays a critical role in password strength. Passwords are easy to crack because most users do not choose strong passwords, instead opting for simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, or easy-to-guess terms. If users were forced to choose stronger passwords, they would be harder to crack."
What is the purpose of a password-cracking program?,The purpose of a password-cracking program is for attackers to try many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords to gain unauthorized access to somebody's account.
What kind of information do password-cracking programs try to combine?,Password-cracking programs try to combine many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords in their attempts to gain access to accounts.
What is the consequence of not forcing users to choose strong passwords?,"The consequence of not forcing users to choose strong passwords is that passwords remain relatively easy to crack, as users will typically choose simple, easy-to-guess passwords that password-cracking programs can readily determine."
What is the definition of authentication based on the provided scenario?,"Based on the provided scenario, authentication is the process by which one party, such as Bob, can be sure that he is communicating with the intended party, Alice, and not someone attempting to impersonate her."
"Explain the concept of ""something you know"" as an authentication method.","""Something you know"" as an authentication method refers to using a piece of secret information that only the legitimate user should possess, such as a secret password. If the user provides this correct secret, their identity is authenticated."
"Why is it important for a password to be a ""secret only she should know""?","It is important for a password to be a ""secret only she should know"" because this exclusivity is the basis of its authentication power. If others know the secret, they can impersonate the legitimate user, undermining the security of the system."
"What is the general principle behind using ""something you know"" for authentication?","The general principle behind using ""something you know"" for authentication is that a user proves their identity by providing a piece of information that is uniquely known to them, such as a password. If this secret is correct, their identity is verified."
What is the risk associated with users choosing common names or dictionary words for passwords?,"The risk associated with users choosing common names or dictionary words for passwords is that these types of passwords are easy for attackers to guess. Password-cracking programs use dictionaries containing such common terms, making these passwords highly vulnerable to offline cracking."
"Describe the process of ""sniffing & extracting the 'password hash'"".","The process of ""sniffing & extracting the 'password hash'"" involves hackers intercepting network traffic to capture the hashed version of a password as a user logs in. This password hash, generated by a common standard hash function, is then used for offline cracking attempts rather than the plain-text password."
What is the significance of storing password hashes in dictionaries for hackers?,"Storing password hashes in dictionaries is significant for hackers because it allows them to perform offline password cracking. They can compare extracted password hashes against a vast collection of pre-computed hashes for common passwords, quickly identifying weak passwords without needing to interact with the live system."
How does the simplicity of password schemes benefit implementation?,The simplicity of password schemes benefits implementation by making them easier to set up and integrate into systems compared to more complex authentication mechanisms like biometrics. This ease of implementation can lead to wider adoption.
What is the main challenge in password security systems related to user behavior?,"The main challenge in password security systems related to user behavior is that most users do not choose strong passwords. Instead, they opt for simple, easy-to-guess concatenations of common names, dictionary words, or phrases, making their accounts vulnerable to attackers."
What is the overall goal of authentication in a communication scenario?,"The overall goal of authentication in a communication scenario is to establish trust and certainty regarding the identity of the communicating parties. For instance, it ensures that if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, he can be sure he is communicating with the genuine Alice and not an impersonator."
