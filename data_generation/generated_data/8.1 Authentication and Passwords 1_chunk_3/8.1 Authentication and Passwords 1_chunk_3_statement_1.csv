Define the core question that authentication seeks to answer.,"The core question that authentication seeks to answer, particularly when considering communication between two parties like Bob and Alice, is: \""If Bob wants to communicate with Alice, how can he be sure that he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her?\"" Authentication, in this context, is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system."
Explain the fundamental problem authentication addresses using the Alice and Bob scenario.,"The fundamental problem authentication addresses, illustrated by the Alice and Bob scenario, is ensuring the genuine identity of a communicating party. Specifically, if Bob intends to communicate with Alice, authentication mechanisms are necessary to guarantee that he is indeed interacting with Alice and not an imposter. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system."
What are the three primary categories of methods Bob can use to authenticate Alice's identity?,"Bob can authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of three primary categories of methods: \""something you know,\"" \""something you have,\"" and \""something you are.\"" Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system."
List the different types of authentication methods available for verifying identity.,"The different types of authentication methods available for verifying identity fall into three categories: \""something you know,\"" \""something you have,\"" and \""something you are.\"" Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system."
"Describe the \""something you know\"" authentication method.","The \""something you know\"" authentication method involves verifying identity based on a secret piece of information that only the legitimate user should possess. A prime example of this method is the use of passwords. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system."
"How does Bob use a \""something you know\"" method to authenticate Alice?","Bob uses a \""something you know\"" method to authenticate Alice by asking her for a secret that only she should know, such as her secret password. If Alice provides the correct password, Bob can then assume he is communicating with the authentic Alice. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system."
What is the first general method Bob can employ to authenticate Alice?,"The first general method Bob can employ to authenticate Alice is to ask her for some secret only she should know, such as her secret password.
