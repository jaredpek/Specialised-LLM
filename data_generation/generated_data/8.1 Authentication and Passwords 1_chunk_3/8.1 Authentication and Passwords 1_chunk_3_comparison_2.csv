Compare the advantages of using passwords for authentication with their disadvantages.,"The advantages of using passwords for authentication include their simplicity to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics, and their ease of understanding for users. However, there are significant disadvantages. Most users do not choose strong passwords, making them vulnerable to attackers. Users commonly select passwords that are simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases, which attackers can exploit."
What are the differences between password schemes and biometrics in terms of implementation simplicity?,"Password schemes are considered simple to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics. Biometrics, which involve verifying identity based on unique biological characteristics, are mentioned as a more complex alternative to implement than password systems."
Compare strong passwords with weak passwords in terms of attacker guessability.,"Strong passwords are those that are hard for attackers to guess, making them more secure. In contrast, weak passwords are those that are easy for attackers to guess, typically because users choose simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. Password-cracking programs can easily determine a significant percentage of weak usernames and passwords in a system."
What are the differences between user-chosen passwords and the methods attackers use to guess them?,"Users often choose passwords that are simple concatenations of common names, common dictionary words, common street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases. Attackers, on the other hand, do not typically try various combinations directly on applications. Instead, they commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. They then use password cracking programs, often with dictionaries of common passwords and common login names, to crack these hashes offline. A ""password hash"" is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password, used for storage and verification."
Compare common names as passwords with common dictionary words as passwords.,"Both common names and common dictionary words are examples of weak password choices that users frequently make. These types of passwords are simple concatenations that are easy for attackers to guess, especially when using password-cracking programs equipped with dictionaries of such terms."
What are the differences between common street names as passwords and other easy-to-guess terms or phrases as passwords?,"Common street names and other easy-to-guess terms or phrases are both categories of weak passwords that users tend to choose. These are simple concatenations that make passwords vulnerable, as they can be easily determined by attackers using password-cracking programs that leverage dictionaries of common words and phrases."
Compare hackers' direct application attacks with hackers' password hash sniffing.,"Hackers typically do not go directly to applications to try various combinations of passwords. Instead, a common method is to sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. A ""password hash"" is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password, used for storage and verification. This method allows them to obtain the hash without directly interacting with the application's login interface."
What are the differences between password hash sniffing and using password cracking programs?,"Password hash sniffing is the process where hackers commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. A ""password hash"" is the output of a common standard hash function applied to a password. Once the hash is obtained, password cracking programs are then used offline. These programs employ dictionaries of common passwords to try and determine the original password from its hash, effectively cracking it."
Compare online password cracking with offline password cracking.,"The document implies that password cracking, specifically using password cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords, is performed ""Offline!"". This means that once a ""password hash"" (the output of a common standard hash function) is sniffed and extracted from the internet during login, the process of attempting to determine the original password from that hash occurs without direct, real-time interaction with the live application or network."
What are the differences between password hashes appearing in dictionaries and not appearing in dictionaries?,"If a user's ""password hash"" (the output of a common standard hash function) appears in a dictionary used by a password cracking program, it means the password has been compromised and is easily crackable. If the password hash does not appear in such a dictionary, it implies the password is not a common or easily guessable one, making it harder for attackers using dictionary attacks to crack."
Compare the effectiveness of password-cracking programs with the security provided by user-chosen strong passwords.,"Password-cracking programs are highly effective against weak passwords, capable of determining 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system, especially when users choose simple concatenations of common words or names. Conversely, user-chosen strong passwords, which are hard for such programs to guess, significantly reduce the effectiveness of these cracking programs, making accounts more secure."
What are the differences between an attacker's need for one valid credential and the overall security of a system's passwords?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password. This highlights a critical vulnerability: even if a system has many secure passwords, the compromise of just one set of credentials can grant access. The overall security of a system's passwords is therefore dependent on every user choosing strong passwords, as the weakness of a single password can undermine the entire system's defense against an attacker."
Compare the ease of cracking passwords with the difficulty of cracking passwords based on user choice.,"Passwords are relatively easy to crack when users choose weak passwords, such as common names, dictionary words, or easy-to-guess phrases. Password-cracking programs can exploit these choices. Conversely, passwords become difficult to crack if users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess, implying a need for strong, complex, and unique passwords."
"What are the differences between authentication using ""something you know"" and ""something you have""?","Authentication using ""something you know"" relies on a secret piece of information that only the legitimate user should know, such as a password. If the user provides the correct secret, their identity is verified. Authentication using ""something you have"" refers to verifying identity based on a physical item or token that the user possesses, though the document does not elaborate on specific examples for this method."
"Compare authentication using ""something you know"" with ""something you are"".","Authentication using ""something you know"" involves verifying identity based on a secret piece of information that only the legitimate user should know, like a password. If the correct password is provided, the identity is assumed to be valid. Authentication using ""something you are"" refers to verifying identity based on an inherent characteristic of the user, such as a biometric trait, though the document does not elaborate on specific examples for this method."
"What are the differences between authentication using ""something you have"" and ""something you are""?","Authentication using ""something you have"" relies on verifying identity based on a physical item or token that the user possesses. Authentication using ""something you are"" relies on verifying identity based on an inherent characteristic of the user, such as a biometric trait. The document lists these as two distinct types of methods Bob may use to authenticate and verify Alice's identity, alongside ""something you know,"" but does not provide further details on specific examples or mechanisms for ""something you have"" or ""something you are."""
Compare authentication using one method with using multiple methods.,"Bob may be able to authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of three types of methods: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" and ""something you are."" Using one method means relying solely on a single factor, such as a password (""something you know""). Using multiple methods would involve combining two or all three of these types, enhancing the security by requiring more than one form of verification."
What are the differences between the goal of authentication and the risk of impersonation?,"The goal of authentication is to ensure that when one party, like Bob, wants to communicate with another, like Alice, he can be sure that he is indeed communicating with Alice. The risk of impersonation is the threat that someone might try to pretend to be Alice, thereby deceiving Bob into communicating with an unauthorized party. Authentication mechanisms are designed to mitigate this risk by verifying the true identity of the communicating party."
Compare the simplicity of password implementation with the simplicity for users to understand passwords.,"Password schemes offer two distinct advantages related to simplicity. One advantage is that they are simple to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms. Another advantage is that password security systems are simple for users to understand. Both aspects contribute to the widespread use of passwords, making them accessible for both developers and end-users."
What are the differences between password security systems and other authentication mechanisms in terms of user understanding?,"Password security systems are noted for being simple for users to understand. This is presented as an advantage. Other authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics, are implied to be potentially less simple for users to understand, though the document does not explicitly detail their complexity from a user's perspective."
Compare password security systems with biometrics in terms of implementation simplicity.,"Password security systems are described as simple to implement. In contrast, biometrics are mentioned as another type of authentication mechanism that is comparatively less simple to implement than password schemes. This suggests that biometrics involve more complex processes or infrastructure for their deployment."
What are the differences between users choosing strong passwords and users choosing weak passwords?,"Users choosing strong passwords would select complex, hard-to-guess combinations that are not easily found in dictionaries or common lists, making them resistant to password-cracking programs. Conversely, users choosing weak passwords select simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, street names, or other easy-to-guess terms or phrases, which makes them highly vulnerable to attackers and password-cracking programs."
Compare password-cracking programs using common login names with using concatenations of common words.,"Attackers interested in hacking an account can use password-cracking programs that leverage both common login names and concatenations of common words as part of their strategy to guess passwords. Both methods are employed by these programs to try a wide range of easily predictable credentials, aiming to determine 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system."
What are the differences between the percentage of passwords cracked by programs and the remaining uncracked passwords?,"Password cracking programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system. This means that a significant portion of passwords are vulnerable. The remaining 80 to 90 percent of passwords are, by implication, not easily determined by these common cracking programs, suggesting they might be stronger or less predictable, unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for such programs to guess."
Compare an attacker's need for a single valid credential with the total number of credentials in a system.,"An attacker typically needs only one valid username and password to gain access to a system, regardless of the total number of credentials present. This highlights that the security of the entire system can be compromised by the weakest link, even if many other credentials are secure. The total number of credentials does not inherently protect against an attacker who successfully obtains just one valid pair."
What are the differences between password management systems and ad-hoc password usage?,"The document states that passwords are so prevalently used that there is a need to further study how to properly build a password management system. This implies that ad-hoc password usage, where users manage their passwords without a structured system, is insufficient or problematic. A ""password management system"" would involve structured methods and tools to help users create, store, and retrieve strong passwords securely, contrasting with the unmanaged, often insecure, practices of ad-hoc usage."
"Compare the concept of a ""secret only she should know"" with a publicly known piece of information.","The concept of a ""secret only she should know"" is fundamental to authentication using ""something you know,"" such as a password. This secret is exclusive to the legitimate user, and its correct provision verifies identity. In contrast, a publicly known piece of information is accessible to anyone and therefore cannot be used to authenticate an individual, as it does not prove unique knowledge or identity."
What are the differences between verifying identity through a password and verifying identity through other means?,"Verifying identity through a password, a method of ""something you know,"" involves the user providing a secret only they should know. If the correct password is given, the identity is assumed to be valid. Verifying identity through other means could involve ""something you have"" (e.g., a physical token) or ""something you are"" (e.g., biometrics), which are different categories of authentication methods that rely on possession or inherent characteristics rather than secret knowledge."
Compare the process of Bob authenticating Alice with Alice authenticating Bob.,"The document specifically frames authentication from Bob's perspective: ""if Bob wants to communicate with Alice, how can he be sure that he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her?"" This focuses on Bob verifying Alice's identity. While the principles of authentication would apply symmetrically, the document does not explicitly describe Alice authenticating Bob, only Bob's need to verify Alice's identity."
"What are the differences between the question of ""how can he be sure"" and the methods used to achieve that certainty?","The question of ""how can he be sure"" refers to the fundamental problem of authentication: how Bob can verify he is communicating with Alice and not an impersonator. The methods used to achieve that certainty are the practical approaches to solve this problem. These methods include relying on ""something you know"" (like a password), ""something you have,"" or ""something you are,"" which are the mechanisms designed to provide the assurance Bob seeks."
"Compare the general method of ""something you know"" with the specific example of ""passwords.""","The general method of ""something you know"" is one of the three types of authentication methods Bob can use to verify Alice's identity. It refers broadly to any secret information known only to the legitimate user. ""Passwords"" are presented as the first general and most prevalent example of this ""something you know"" method. A ""password"" is a secret string of characters that only the user should know, which, if produced correctly, allows for authentication."
What are the differences between the advantages of password schemes and the advantages of biometrics in terms of implementation simplicity?,"One advantage of password schemes is that they are simple to implement. Biometrics, while also an authentication mechanism, are mentioned as a comparison point, implying that they are generally less simple to implement than password schemes. Therefore, password schemes offer an advantage in terms of straightforward implementation compared to biometrics."
Compare the disadvantages of password security systems with their advantages.,"The disadvantages of password security systems include the fact that most users do not choose strong passwords, making them easy for attackers to guess. Users often select simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, street names, or easy-to-guess terms. In contrast, the advantages are that password schemes are simple to implement compared to other authentication mechanisms like biometrics, and they are simple for users to understand."
What are the differences between passwords chosen by users and passwords forced to be strong?,"Passwords chosen by users are often weak, consisting of simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, street names, or easy-to-guess terms, making them vulnerable to cracking programs. Passwords forced to be strong, on the other hand, imply a system or policy that compels users to select complex, hard-to-guess passwords, thereby making them significantly more resistant to password-cracking programs and enhancing overall security."
Compare password hashes with plain-text passwords.,"The document mentions that hackers commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in, and that systems normally use a common standard hash function. A ""password hash"" is the output of this hash function. This implies that systems do not store or transmit plain-text passwords directly, but rather their hashed representations. Plain-text passwords are the original, unencrypted passwords that users input, which are then converted into hashes for security purposes."
"What are the differences between a common standard hash function and a custom, non-standard hash function?","The document states that systems normally use a common standard hash function when dealing with password hashes. A ""common standard hash function"" is a widely recognized and typically well-vetted cryptographic algorithm used to transform data into a fixed-size string of characters, ensuring consistency and often security through community review. A custom, non-standard hash function, while not explicitly mentioned, would be one developed uniquely for a specific system, potentially lacking the rigorous testing and security analysis of a common standard, and thus might introduce unknown vulnerabilities."
Compare an attacker's goal of hacking an account with a user's goal of securing an account.,"An attacker's goal of hacking an account is to gain unauthorized access to a system, typically by using password-cracking programs to determine a valid username and password. A user's goal of securing an account is to protect their credentials and prevent unauthorized access. This is achieved by choosing strong passwords that are hard for attackers to guess and by utilizing proper password management practices."
What are the differences between the ease of cracking passwords and the difficulty of cracking passwords?,"The ease of cracking passwords arises when users choose weak passwords, such as common names or dictionary words, which password-cracking programs can easily exploit. The difficulty of cracking passwords occurs when users are forced to choose strong passwords that are complex and not easily guessable by these programs, making the attacker's task significantly harder."
Compare password-cracking programs' effectiveness on weak passwords with their effectiveness on strong passwords.,"Password-cracking programs are highly effective on weak passwords, as they can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system, especially those that are simple concatenations of common words or names. Their effectiveness on strong passwords is significantly lower; passwords that are hard for these programs to guess are much more resistant to cracking, implying that strong passwords are a key defense against such attacks."
What are the differences between the security of a password if its hash is in a dictionary versus if it's not?,"If a password's ""hash"" (the output of a common standard hash function) appears in a dictionary used by password cracking programs, the password is considered compromised and highly insecure, as it can be easily cracked offline. If the password's hash does not appear in such a dictionary, it indicates a higher level of security, as the password is not a common or easily guessable one, making it much harder for attackers to crack using dictionary attacks."
Compare the process of logging in with the process of password cracking.,"The process of logging in involves a user providing their credentials, during which hackers may sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet. A ""password hash"" is the output of a common standard hash function. The process of password cracking, on the other hand, occurs after the hash has been obtained. It involves attackers using password cracking programs, often offline, with dictionaries of common passwords to try and determine the original password from its hash."
What are the differences between the user's perspective on password simplicity and the attacker's perspective on password vulnerability?,"From the user's perspective, password security systems are simple to understand, which is an advantage. This simplicity often leads users to choose easy-to-guess passwords like common names or dictionary words. From the attacker's perspective, this user-chosen simplicity translates directly into password vulnerability, as these weak passwords are easy to crack using password-cracking programs and dictionary attacks, allowing them to gain unauthorized access."
"Compare authentication as a general concept with ""something you know"" as a specific method.","Authentication, as a general concept, is the process of verifying a party's identity, ensuring, for example, that Bob is communicating with Alice and not an impersonator. ""Something you know"" is a specific method of authentication, relying on a secret piece of information (like a password) that only the legitimate user should know. It is one of three broad categories of methods used to achieve the general goal of authentication."
What are the differences between the need for authentication in communication and the risk of not authenticating?,"The need for authentication in communication arises from the desire to be sure of the identity of the communicating party, for instance, Bob wanting to be certain he is communicating with Alice. The risk of not authenticating is that the communication partner might be an impersonator, leading to potential security breaches or misdirection. Authentication mechanisms are designed to mitigate this risk by providing identity verification."
Compare the role of a secret password in authentication with the role of other factors.,"A secret password plays a central role in authentication as a form of ""something you know."" If Alice produces the right password, Bob can assume he is communicating with her, as it's a secret only she should know. Other factors, such as ""something you have"" (e.g., a physical token) or ""something you are"" (e.g., biometrics), are alternative or supplementary roles in authentication, relying on possession or inherent characteristics rather than secret knowledge to verify identity."
What are the differences between the assumption of communication with Alice based on a password and the uncertainty without it?,"If Alice produces the right password, Bob can assume he is communicating with Alice, as the password is a secret only she should know, serving as a verification of her identity. Without this authentication mechanism, or if the password is incorrect, there would be uncertainty, and Bob could not be sure he is communicating with Alice and not someone trying to impersonate her."
Compare the prevalence of passwords with the need for better password management.,"Passwords are so prevalently used as an authentication method that they are the first general method discussed. Despite their widespread use, there is an explicit need to further study how to properly build a password management system. This indicates that while passwords are common, their current usage often lacks proper management, leading to vulnerabilities that necessitate improved systems for their handling and security."
What are the differences between the simplicity of password schemes and the complexity of building a secure password management system?,"Password schemes are noted for being simple to implement and simple for users to understand. However, despite this inherent simplicity, the document also states that passwords are so prevalently used that there is a need to further study how to properly build a password management system. This implies that while the basic concept of a password is simple, creating a *secure* and *proper* password management system involves a level of complexity that requires dedicated study and development beyond simple implementation."
"Compare the security implications of common names as passwords with random, complex strings.","Common names used as passwords have severe security implications because they are simple concatenations that are easy for attackers to guess, especially with password-cracking programs using dictionaries. This makes accounts highly vulnerable. In contrast, random, complex strings, while not explicitly mentioned as a user choice, would represent the ideal for strong passwords. Such strings are hard for attackers to guess and for password-cracking programs to determine, significantly enhancing security by making the password difficult to crack."
What are the differences between the method of sniffing password hashes and the method of using password cracking programs with dictionaries?,"The method of sniffing password hashes involves hackers commonly extracting the ""password hash"" (the output of a common standard hash function) over the internet as a user logs in. This is the acquisition phase. The method of using password cracking programs with dictionaries is the subsequent phase, where these programs take the acquired password hashes and attempt to determine the original passwords offline by comparing the hashes against a dictionary of common passwords. Sniffing is about obtaining the hash, while cracking programs with dictionaries are about reversing the hash to find the password."
