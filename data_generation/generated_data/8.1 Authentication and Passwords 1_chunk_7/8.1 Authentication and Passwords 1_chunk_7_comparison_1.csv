Compare iris scan with retina scan.,"An iris scan involves a camera taking a picture of a person's iris and storing certain features of it in the system. In contrast, a retinal scan involves infrared light being shot into a user's eyes to read the pattern of retinal blood vessels, which is then used to create a signature stored by a computer system. For a retinal scan, the user places their head in front of a device, and the device then blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye. An iris scan is considered less intrusive as the user only needs to look in a particular direction, and a camera takes a quick picture of the iris."
What are the differences between iris scan and retina scan?,"The primary differences between an iris scan and a retina scan lie in the method of capturing the biometric data and the part of the eye used. An iris scan captures an image of the iris, the colored part of the eye, and stores its unique features. This process is relatively quick and requires the user to simply look in a specific direction. A retinal scan, on the other hand, uses infrared light to map the pattern of blood vessels in the retina, the back of the eye. This process is more involved, requiring the user to place their head in front of a device that may emit a puff of air and a laser."
Explain how an iris scan works.,"An iris scan is a biometric technique where a camera captures an image of a person's iris. This image is then processed to extract and store unique features of the iris within a system. The process is considered less intrusive because it only requires the user to look in a particular direction, and the camera takes a quick picture of the iris."
Describe the process of a retinal scan.,"A retinal scan is a biometric technique that uses infrared light shot into a user's eyes. The pattern of the retinal blood vessels is then read to create a signature that is stored by a computer system. During the scan, the user places their head in front of a device, which then blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
What is the difference between iris scan and palm scan in terms of social acceptance?,Studies indicate that iris scans are more socially acceptable than palm scans.
How does an iris scan compare to a palm scan in terms of user interaction?,"For a palm scan, a user is required to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds. In contrast, an iris scan is less intrusive, as a camera simply takes a quick picture of the user's iris while they look in a particular direction, without requiring physical contact or prolonged interaction."
What is fingerprinting and how does it work?,Fingerprinting is a biometric technique where a user places their finger onto a reader. This reader then scans the set of curves that make up the user's fingerprint.
What are the social implications of fingerprinting as a biometric technique?,Fingerprinting is not as socially accepted as other biometric identification techniques because people often associate taking fingerprints with criminal activity.
Compare fingerprinting with palm scan regarding the amount of information provided.,Fingerprinting provides less information than a palm scan.
Describe the mechanism of voice identification.,"Voice identification is a mechanism where a computer asks a user to say a particular phrase. The computer system then takes the electrically coded signals of the user's voice, compares them to a databank of previous signals, and determines if there is a close enough match."
What does a computer system do during voice identification?,"During voice identification, the computer system takes the electrically coded signals of the user's voice. It then compares these signals to a databank of previous signals to determine if there is a close enough match."
Explain facial recognition.,Facial recognition involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face. A computer system then attempts to recognize the features within that picture.
What is signature dynamics?,Signature dynamics is a biometric technique that records not only a user's signature but also the pressure and timing with which the user makes various curves and motions while writing.
What is the advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching?,The advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate.
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"Key disadvantages to biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define a false negative in the context of biometric authentication.,"A false negative occurs when a user is indeed an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device rejects them."
Define a false positive in the context of biometric authentication.,A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a user.
What is social acceptance in relation to biometric authentication techniques?,Social acceptance is an issue to take into account when considering biometric authentication techniques. All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than entering a password.
How does the social acceptance of biometric techniques compare to passwords?,All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than entering a password.
Compare iris scan and facial recognition.,"An iris scan captures unique features from the iris of the eye using a camera, requiring the user to look in a specific direction. Facial recognition involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face, and a computer system then analyzes its features. Both use cameras to capture biometric data, but they focus on different parts of the body and have different interaction requirements."
What is the primary function of a camera in an iris scan?,"In an iris scan, a camera takes a picture of a person's iris. This image is then used to store certain features about the iris in the system."
Describe the interaction required for a retinal scan.,"For a retinal scan, the user puts their head in front of a device. The device then blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
What makes an iris scan less intrusive compared to other methods?,"An iris scan is less intrusive because the user does not have to do anything except look in a particular direction, and a camera takes a quick picture of their iris."
How does fingerprinting capture biometric data?,Fingerprinting captures biometric data by having the user place their finger onto a reader that scans the set of curves that make up their fingerprint.
What is the main reason for the lower social acceptance of fingerprinting?,The lower social acceptance of fingerprinting stems from the general association people have between taking fingerprints and criminal activity.
What is the core process of voice identification?,The core process of voice identification involves a computer asking a user to say a specific phrase. The computer then analyzes the electrically coded signals of the user's voice by comparing them to a stored database of previous signals to determine a match.
What information is analyzed in facial recognition?,"Facial recognition analyzes the features of a person's face. This is done after a camera takes a picture of the face, and a computer system then works to recognize these features."
How does signature dynamics differ from simple signature matching?,Signature dynamics records not only the signature itself but also the pressure and timing of the user's movements while writing. Simple signature matching typically only compares the visual appearance of the signature.
What are the four key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques mentioned?,"The four key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques are: the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Explain the concept of a false negative in biometric systems.,"A false negative in biometric systems occurs when the system incorrectly rejects an individual who is a legitimate user. In essence, the system fails to recognize an authorized person."
Explain the concept of a false positive in biometric systems.,A false positive in biometric systems occurs when the system incorrectly accepts an individual who is not an authorized user. This means an impersonator is successfully identified as the legitimate user.
What is the trade-off consideration for biometric systems?,"A trade-off is needed for both false negatives and false positives in biometric systems, implying a balance must be struck between security and usability."
