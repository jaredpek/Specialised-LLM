What is an iris scan and how does it work?,"An iris scan is a biometric technique that involves scanning a person's iris. In this process, a camera captures an image of the iris and stores certain features of it within the system. This method is considered more socially acceptable than palm scans, and it is less intrusive as it only requires the user to look in a particular direction for a quick picture, without needing to place their hand on a reader for an extended period."
Explain the process of a retina scan.,"A retina scan is a biometric technique where infrared light is directed into a user's eyes. The pattern of the retinal blood vessels is then read to create a unique signature that is stored by a computer system. During a retinal scan, the user positions their head in front of a device, which then emits a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye to capture the retinal pattern."
How is fingerprinting performed as a biometric technique?,"Fingerprinting as a biometric technique involves a user placing their finger onto a reader. This reader scans the unique set of curves and patterns that constitute the user's fingerprint. It's important to note that fingerprinting is generally less socially accepted compared to other biometric identification methods, as it is often associated with criminal activity. Additionally, fingerprinting provides less information for identification than a palm scan."
Describe the mechanism of voice identification.,"Voice identification is a biometric mechanism where a computer prompts a user to speak a specific phrase. The computer system then processes the user's voice, converting it into electrically coded signals. These signals are compared against a database of previously recorded signals. The system determines if there is a sufficiently close match to authenticate the user."
What is facial recognition in the context of biometrics?,"Facial recognition, as a biometric technique, involves a camera capturing an image of a person's face. A computer system then analyzes this image to identify and recognize specific features of the face for authentication purposes."
What are signature dynamics in biometric authentication?,Signature dynamics is a biometric technique that goes beyond simply recording a user's signature. It also captures the pressure and timing applied by the user while they form the various curves and motions during the act of writing their signature. The primary advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is its significantly higher difficulty to replicate.
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"Key disadvantages associated with biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define a false negative in biometric authentication.,"A false negative occurs in biometric authentication when an individual is a genuine and authorized user of the system, but the biometric authentication device incorrectly rejects them."
Define a false positive in biometric authentication.,"A false positive occurs in biometric authentication when an unauthorized individual, an impersonator, successfully bypasses the system by impersonating a legitimate user."
What is the social acceptance of biometric authentication techniques compared to passwords?,All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are generally less socially accepted than the traditional method of entering a password. Social acceptance is a significant factor to consider when implementing biometric authentication methods.
How does an iris scan store user information?,An iris scan stores information by capturing an image of a person's iris and then extracting and storing certain unique features from that image within the system.
What is the primary difference in user interaction between an iris scan and a palm scan?,"The primary difference is that while a palm scan requires the user to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds, an iris scan is quicker and less demanding, with a camera simply taking a picture of the user's iris as they look in a specific direction."
What type of light is used in a retina scan?,Infrared light is used in a retina scan.
What specific feature of the eye is analyzed in a retina scan?,"In a retina scan, the pattern of retinal blood vessels is analyzed."
What actions does a device perform during a retinal scan?,"During a retinal scan, the device blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
What does a fingerprint reader scan?,A fingerprint reader scans the set of curves that make up a person's fingerprint.
Why is fingerprinting considered less socially acceptable than other biometrics?,Fingerprinting is considered less socially acceptable because people often associate the act of taking fingerprints with criminal activity.
How does voice identification work with a computer?,"Voice identification works by having a computer ask a user to say a particular phrase. The computer then converts the user's voice into electrically coded signals, compares these signals to a stored databank of previous signals, and determines if there is a close enough match."
What does a computer system analyze in facial recognition?,"In facial recognition, a computer system analyzes the features of a person's face captured in a picture."
What aspects of a signature are recorded in signature dynamics?,Signature dynamics records not only the visual representation of a user's signature but also the pressure and timing involved as the user creates the curves and motions while writing.
What is the main advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching?,The main advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate.
What are the four main disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques mentioned?,"The four main disadvantages mentioned are the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
When does a false negative occur in biometric authentication?,A false negative occurs when an authentic user is rejected by the biometric authentication device.
When does a false positive occur in biometric authentication?,A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a legitimate user.
What is the trade-off consideration for biometric authentication?,A trade-off is needed for both false positives and false negatives in biometric authentication.
What is the role of a camera in an iris scan?,"In an iris scan, a camera is used to take a picture of a person's iris."
What makes an iris scan less intrusive than some other biometric methods?,An iris scan is less intrusive because the user does not have to do anything other than look in a particular direction for the camera to capture the image.
What is the purpose of reading the pattern of retinal blood vessels?,The purpose of reading the pattern of retinal blood vessels is to create a signature that can be stored by a computer system for biometric identification.
What is the user required to do for a fingerprint scan?,"For a fingerprint scan, the user is required to place their finger onto a reader."
What is the computer system's action after receiving electrically coded signals of a user's voice?,"After receiving the electrically coded signals of a user's voice, the computer system compares them to a databank of previous signals to determine if there is a close enough match."
What does facial recognition involve?,Facial recognition involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face and a computer system attempting to recognize its features.
What is the key advantage of signature dynamics in terms of security?,The key advantage of signature dynamics is that it is far more difficult to replicate compared to simple signature matching.
What are the general categories of disadvantages for biometric authentication techniques?,"The general categories of disadvantages for biometric authentication techniques are false positives, false negatives, social acceptance, and key management issues."
How does a biometric authentication device reject an authentic user?,A biometric authentication device rejects an authentic user when a false negative occurs.
How can an impersonator successfully gain access using biometrics?,"An impersonator can successfully gain access using biometrics when a false positive occurs, meaning they are able to impersonate a legitimate user."
What is the comparison point for the social acceptance of biometric techniques?,"The social acceptance of biometric techniques is compared to entering a password, with biometrics generally being less accepted."
What is stored in the system after an iris scan?,Certain features of the person's iris are stored in the system after an iris scan.
