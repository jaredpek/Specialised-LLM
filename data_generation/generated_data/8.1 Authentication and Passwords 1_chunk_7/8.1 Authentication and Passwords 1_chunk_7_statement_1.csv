Define the concept of Iris Scan.,"An Iris Scan is a biometric technique where a camera captures an image of a person's iris. This image is then used to store certain features of the iris within a system for identification purposes. It is considered more socially acceptable than palm scans and is less intrusive, as it only requires the user to look in a specific direction for a quick picture, without needing to place their hand on a reader for an extended period."
Explain how an Iris Scan works.,"In an Iris Scan, a camera takes a picture of a person's iris. The system then extracts and stores specific features from this iris image. For authentication, a new image is captured, and its features are compared against the stored data to determine a match. This process is considered less intrusive than other methods as it only requires the user to look in a particular direction."
What are the advantages of Iris Scan over Palm Scan?,"Studies indicate that Iris Scans are more socially acceptable than Palm Scans. Additionally, an Iris Scan is less intrusive because it only requires the user to look in a particular direction for a quick picture, whereas a Palm Scan might require the user to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds."
Describe the process of a Retina Scan.,"A Retina Scan is a biometric technique that uses infrared light shot into a user's eyes. The pattern of the retinal blood vessels is then read to create a signature. This signature is subsequently stored by a computer system. The process involves the user placing their head in front of a device, which then blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye to capture the retinal pattern."
What information is captured during a Retina Scan?,"During a Retina Scan, infrared light is directed into the user's eyes to capture the pattern of their retinal blood vessels. This unique pattern is then used to create a signature that is stored in a computer system for identification."
How does a Retina Scan differ from an Iris Scan in terms of user interaction?,"A Retina Scan requires the user to place their head in front of a device, which then uses a puff of air and a laser to scan the retina. In contrast, an Iris Scan is less intrusive and only requires the user to look in a particular direction for a camera to take a quick picture of their iris."
Explain the mechanism of Fingerprinting for biometric identification.,Fingerprinting is a biometric technique where a user places their finger onto a reader. This reader scans the unique set of curves and patterns that make up the fingerprint. The scanned data is then used for identification purposes.
