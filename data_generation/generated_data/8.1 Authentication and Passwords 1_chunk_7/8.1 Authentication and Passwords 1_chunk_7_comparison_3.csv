What are the differences between an iris scan and a retina scan?,"An iris scan involves a camera taking a picture of a person's iris and storing certain features about it in the system. It is considered less intrusive as the user only needs to look in a particular direction. In contrast, a retina scan uses infrared light shot into a user's eyes to read the pattern of retinal blood vessels, creating a signature stored by a computer system. The process for a retina scan requires the user to place their head in front of a device, which then blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
Compare iris scan and palm scan in terms of social acceptability and intrusiveness.,"Studies indicate that iris scans are more socially acceptable than palm scans. Furthermore, iris scans are less intrusive because a camera simply takes a quick picture of the user's iris as they look in a particular direction, whereas a palm scan requires the user to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds."
Explain how fingerprinting works and its social perception.,"Fingerprinting is a biometric technique where a user places their finger onto a reader that scans the set of curves that make up their fingerprint. However, fingerprinting is not as socially accepted as other biometric identification techniques because people often associate taking fingerprints with criminal activity."
Describe the process of voice identification.,"Voice identification is a mechanism where a computer asks a user to say a particular phrase. The computer system then takes the electrically coded signals of the user's voice, compares them to a databank of previous signals, and determines if there is a close enough match."
What is facial recognition and how does it function?,Facial recognition involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face. A computer system then attempts to recognize the features of that face.
What is signature dynamics and how does it differ from simple signature matching?,Signature dynamics is a technique that records not only a user's signature but also the pressure and timing at which the user makes various curves and motions while writing. The advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate.
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"Key disadvantages to biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define 'false negative' in the context of biometric authentication.,"A false negative occurs when a user is indeed an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device rejects them."
Define 'false positive' in the context of biometric authentication.,A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a user.
How does social acceptance factor into biometric authentication techniques?,Social acceptance is an issue to take into account when considering biometric authentication techniques. All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than entering a password.
Compare iris scan and fingerprinting regarding their process.,"An iris scan involves a camera taking a picture of a person's iris and storing certain features about it. In contrast, fingerprinting requires the user to place their finger onto a reader that scans the set of curves that make up their fingerprint."
What information is captured during an iris scan?,"During an iris scan, a camera takes a picture of a person's iris and stores certain features about it in the system."
What is the mechanism of a retina scan?,"A retina scan is a biometric technique where infrared light is shot into a user's eyes, and the pattern of retinal blood vessels is read to create a signature that is stored by a computer system."
What is the user interaction required for a retina scan?,"In a retinal scan, the user puts their head in front of a device, and then the device blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
What is the primary action in fingerprinting for authentication?,"In fingerprinting, the user places their finger onto a reader that scans the set of curves that makes up their fingerprint."
Why is fingerprinting considered less socially accepted than other biometrics?,Fingerprinting is not as socially accepted as other biometric identification techniques because people generally associate taking fingerprints with criminal activity.
What is a potential limitation of fingerprinting compared to palm scans?,Fingerprinting provides less information than a palm scan.
How does voice identification verify a user?,"Voice identification verifies a user by having a computer ask the user to say a particular phrase. The computer system then takes the electrically coded signals of the user's voice, compares them to a databank of previous signals, and determines if there is a close enough match."
What is the role of a camera in facial recognition?,"In facial recognition, a camera is used to take a picture of a person's face."
What does signature dynamics capture beyond the signature itself?,Signature dynamics captures not only a user's signature but also the pressure and timing at which the user makes various curves and motions while writing.
What is the main advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching?,The advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate.
What are the two types of errors in biometric authentication?,The two types of errors in biometric authentication are false positives and false negatives.
Describe the scenario of a false negative in biometric authentication.,"A false negative occurs when a user is indeed an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device rejects the user."
Describe the scenario of a false positive in biometric authentication.,A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a user.
What is a trade-off that needs to be considered for biometric authentication?,A trade-off that needs to be considered for both false positives and false negatives in biometric authentication.
How does an iris scan compare to a retina scan in terms of user action?,"An iris scan requires the user to look in a particular direction for a camera to capture their iris. A retina scan requires the user to place their head in front of a device, which then uses a puff of air and a laser."
What makes an iris scan less intrusive than a palm scan?,"An iris scan is less intrusive because a camera takes a quick picture of the user's iris, whereas a palm scan requires the user to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds."
What is the core principle of fingerprinting for authentication?,The core principle of fingerprinting for authentication is scanning the unique set of curves that make up a person's fingerprint.
What is the primary input for voice identification?,The primary input for voice identification is the user saying a particular phrase.
What does a computer system analyze in facial recognition?,"In facial recognition, a computer system analyzes the features of a person's face from a picture taken by a camera."
What are the dynamic elements captured by signature dynamics?,Signature dynamics captures the pressure and timing of the curves and motions a user makes while writing their signature.
What is a key management issue related to biometric authentication?,"Key management issues are a disadvantage to biometric authentication techniques, referring to the challenges in managing the keys or data associated with the biometric system."
Compare the social acceptance of biometric techniques to password entry.,All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than entering a password.
What is the purpose of storing features in an iris scan system?,The purpose of storing features in an iris scan system is to create a unique identifier for the user that can be used for authentication.
What type of light is used in a retina scan?,Infrared light is used in a retina scan.
What specific pattern is read in a retina scan?,The pattern of retinal blood vessels is read in a retina scan.
What is the output of a fingerprint scan?,"The output of a fingerprint scan is the set of curves that make up the user's fingerprint, which is then used for authentication."
