What are the differences between an iris scan and a retina scan?,"An iris scan involves a camera taking a picture of a person's iris and storing certain features about it in the system. In contrast, a retinal scan involves infrared light being shot into a user's eyes, and the pattern of retinal blood vessels is read to create a signature that is stored by a computer system. For a retinal scan, the user places their head in front of a device, which then blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye. An iris scan is considered less intrusive as the user only needs to look in a particular direction, and the camera takes a quick picture."
Compare iris scan and palm scan.,"An iris scan is a biometric technique where a camera captures an image of the iris and stores its unique features. Studies indicate that iris scans are more socially acceptable than palm scans. Furthermore, palm scans require the user to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds, whereas an iris scan is quicker, with a camera taking a brief picture of the user's iris. The iris scan is also considered less intrusive because it only requires the user to look in a specific direction."
Explain how fingerprinting works and its social acceptance.,"Fingerprinting is a biometric technique where a user places their finger onto a reader that scans the set of curves that make up their fingerprint. However, fingerprinting is not as socially accepted as other biometric identification techniques because people tend to associate taking fingerprints with criminal activity. Additionally, fingerprinting provides less information compared to a palm scan."
Describe the process of voice identification.,"Voice identification is a mechanism where a computer prompts a user to say a specific phrase. The computer system then captures the electrically coded signals of the user's voice, compares these signals to a stored databank of previous signals, and determines if there is a sufficiently close match."
What is facial recognition?,Facial recognition is a biometric technique that involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face. A computer system then attempts to recognize the features within that image.
Explain signature dynamics.,Signature dynamics is a biometric technique that records not only a user's signature but also the pressure and timing involved as the user forms various curves and motions while writing. The advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is significantly more difficult to replicate.
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"Key disadvantages to biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define false negative in the context of biometrics.,"A false negative occurs when a user is genuinely an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device incorrectly rejects them."
Define false positive in the context of biometrics.,"A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a user, and the biometric authentication system incorrectly accepts them."
Discuss the social acceptance of biometric authentication techniques.,Social acceptance is a significant issue to consider with biometric authentication techniques. All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are generally less socially accepted than the act of entering a password.
Compare iris scan and facial recognition.,"An iris scan captures an image of a person's iris and stores its unique features for identification. Facial recognition, on the other hand, involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face, and a computer system then analyzes its features. While both use cameras, the specific biometric trait captured and analyzed differs."
What is the primary mechanism of a retinal scan?,The primary mechanism of a retinal scan involves shooting infrared light into a user's eyes to read the pattern of their retinal blood vessels. This pattern is then used to create a signature that is stored by a computer system.
How does fingerprinting differ from voice identification?,"Fingerprinting involves scanning the unique set of curves on a user's finger. Voice identification, however, requires a computer to ask a user to say a particular phrase, and then it analyzes the electrically coded signals of the user's voice. The methods of capturing and analyzing the biometric data are distinct."
What makes signature dynamics more advantageous than simple signature matching?,Signature dynamics is more advantageous than simple signature matching because it records not only the signature itself but also the pressure and timing of the user's movements while writing. This additional data makes it far more difficult to replicate compared to just matching the visual appearance of a signature.
What is the role of a camera in iris scans and facial recognition?,"In iris scans, a camera takes a picture of a person's iris to capture its unique features.

Compare the social acceptance of iris scans and fingerprinting.,"Iris scans are generally considered more socially acceptable than fingerprinting. Fingerprinting faces challenges in social acceptance due to its common association with criminal activity, whereas iris scans are often perceived as less intrusive and more neutral."
What is the purpose of a databank in voice identification?,"The databank in voice identification serves as a repository of previously recorded and analyzed voice signals. When a user provides their voice for identification, the system compares the new signals against those stored in the databank to find a match."
How does facial recognition identify a person?,Facial recognition identifies a person by taking a picture of their face and then using a computer system to analyze and recognize the unique features present in that image. These features are then compared against a database of known faces.
What is the main difference between signature dynamics and simple signature matching?,"The main difference lies in the data captured. Simple signature matching primarily focuses on the visual appearance of the signature. Signature dynamics, however, goes further by also recording the pressure and timing of the user's movements while signing, making it a more robust method."
What are the potential issues with biometric authentication techniques?,"Potential issues with biometric authentication techniques include the occurrence of false positives (incorrectly identifying an imposter as a legitimate user), false negatives (incorrectly rejecting a legitimate user), varying levels of social acceptance among different populations, and challenges related to key management."
Describe the process of an iris scan.,An iris scan is a biometric technique where a camera takes a picture of a person's iris. Certain unique features from this image are then extracted and stored within the system for future authentication purposes.
What is the function of the laser in a retinal scan?,"The laser in a retinal scan is used to illuminate the user's eye. This illumination allows the device to capture a detailed image of the pattern of retinal blood vessels, which is crucial for creating the biometric signature."
How does voice identification ensure a close enough match?,Voice identification ensures a close enough match by comparing the electrically coded signals of the user's current voice sample against a databank of previously recorded signals. The system determines a match if the new signals are sufficiently similar to the stored ones.
What is the primary input for facial recognition?,"The primary input for facial recognition is a picture of a person's face, captured by a camera. This image is then processed by a computer system to identify its features."
Why is signature dynamics considered more secure than simple signature matching?,"Signature dynamics is considered more secure because it captures dynamic elements like pressure and timing during the signing process, in addition to the visual form of the signature. These dynamic elements are much harder for an imposter to replicate accurately compared to just mimicking the visual appearance of a signature."
Compare the user experience of an iris scan versus a retinal scan.,"An iris scan is generally a quicker and less intrusive process, requiring the user to simply look in a particular direction while a camera captures their iris. A retinal scan is more involved, requiring the user to place their head in front of a device that then uses infrared light and a laser, potentially involving a puff of air, to scan the retina."
What are the implications of social acceptance for biometric techniques?,"The implications of social acceptance mean that some biometric techniques may face resistance or lower adoption rates if users find them uncomfortable, intrusive, or associated with negative connotations. For instance, fingerprinting's association with crime can hinder its widespread acceptance compared to less stigmatized methods."
What is the difference between a false negative and a false positive in biometric authentication?,"A false negative occurs when a legitimate user is incorrectly denied access. A false positive occurs when an unauthorized individual is incorrectly granted access. Essentially, a false negative is a rejection of a 'true' user, while a false positive is an acceptance of a 'false' user."
How does an iris scan store user information?,"An iris scan stores user information by capturing an image of the iris and then extracting and storing specific, unique features from that image within the system. These stored features serve as the user's biometric identifier."
What is the role of infrared light in capturing retinal patterns?,"Infrared light is used in retinal scans to illuminate the user's eyes. This illumination is necessary to clearly capture the intricate pattern of the retinal blood vessels, which forms the basis of the biometric signature."
What makes voice identification a 'something you are' biometric?,"Voice identification is considered a 'something you are' biometric because it relies on unique physiological and behavioral characteristics of a person's voice, such as pitch, tone, and speech patterns, which are distinct to each individual."
What is the purpose of analyzing facial features in facial recognition?,"The purpose of analyzing facial features in facial recognition is to identify and distinguish individuals based on the unique characteristics of their faces. The computer system recognizes patterns and measurements of features like the distance between eyes, nose shape, and jawline."
How does signature dynamics leverage the writing process for security?,"Signature dynamics leverages the writing process for security by capturing not just the final signature but also the dynamic elements of how it is written, such as the speed, pressure, and stroke order. These dynamic elements are difficult to replicate consistently, thus enhancing security."
