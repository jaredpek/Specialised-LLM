Define the concept of Iris Scan.,"An Iris Scan is a biometric technique where a camera captures an image of a person's iris. This image is then used to store certain features of the iris within a system for identification purposes. It is considered more socially acceptable than palm scans and is less intrusive, requiring the user only to look in a particular direction, rather than placing their hand on a reader for an extended period."
Explain how an Iris Scan works and its advantages.,"An Iris Scan works by using a camera to take a picture of a person's iris. Specific features from this iris image are then stored in a system. A key advantage is its social acceptability, which studies indicate is higher than that of palm scans. Furthermore, it is less intrusive as it only requires the user to look in a specific direction, unlike other methods that might require physical contact for several seconds."
What is a Retina Scan and how is it performed?,"A Retina Scan is a biometric technique that involves shooting infrared light into a user's eyes. The pattern of the retinal blood vessels is then read to create a unique signature that is stored by a computer system. The process requires the user to place their head in front of a device, which then emits a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
Describe the process of a Retina Scan and the data it captures.,"In a Retina Scan, infrared light is directed into the user's eyes. The device then reads the pattern of the retinal blood vessels. This pattern is used to generate a signature, which is subsequently stored in a computer system. The user positions their head in front of a device that then uses a puff of air and a laser to capture the retinal pattern."
Explain the concept of Fingerprinting as a biometric technique.,Fingerprinting is a biometric technique where a user places their finger on a reader. This reader scans the unique set of curves that form the fingerprint. The scanned fingerprint data can then be used for identification.
What are the characteristics and limitations of Fingerprinting?,"Fingerprinting involves a reader scanning the set of curves that make up a user's fingerprint.
