Define the concept of Iris Scan.,"An Iris Scan is a biometric technique where a camera captures an image of a person's iris. This image is then used to store certain features of the iris within a system for identification purposes. Compared to palm scans, iris scans are generally considered more socially acceptable. Unlike palm scanners that may require a user to place their hand on a reader for a few seconds, an iris scan is a quick process where a camera simply takes a picture of the user's iris. It is also considered less intrusive as it only requires the user to look in a specific direction."
Explain how an Iris Scan works and its advantages.,"An Iris Scan is a biometric authentication method that involves a camera taking a picture of a person's iris.
