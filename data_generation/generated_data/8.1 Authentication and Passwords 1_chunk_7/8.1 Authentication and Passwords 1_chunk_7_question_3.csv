What is an iris scan and how does it work?,"An iris scan is a biometric technique that involves scanning a person's iris. In this process, a camera captures an image of the iris and stores certain features of it within the system. This method is considered more socially acceptable than palm scans, and it is less intrusive as it only requires the user to look in a particular direction for a quick picture, without needing to place their hand on a reader for an extended period."
Explain the concept of a retina scan.,"A retina scan is a biometric technique where infrared light is directed into a user's eyes. The pattern of the retinal blood vessels is then read to create a unique signature that is stored by a computer system. During a retinal scan, the user positions their head in front of a device, which then emits a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
How is fingerprinting implemented as a biometric technique?,"Fingerprinting as a biometric technique involves a user placing their finger on a reader. This reader scans the unique set of curves that constitute the user's fingerprint. However, fingerprinting is noted to be less socially accepted compared to other biometric identification methods, as it is often associated with criminal activity. Additionally, it provides less information than a palm scan."
Describe the process of voice identification.,Voice identification is a biometric mechanism where a computer prompts a user to speak a specific phrase. The computer system then converts the user's voice into electrically coded signals. These signals are compared against a database of previously recorded signals to determine if there is a sufficiently close match.
What is facial recognition in the context of biometrics?,Facial recognition is a biometric technique that utilizes a camera to capture an image of a person's face. A computer system then analyzes this image to identify and recognize the distinct features of the face.
What are signature dynamics in biometric authentication?,Signature dynamics is a biometric technique that goes beyond simply recording a user's signature. It also captures the pressure and timing involved as the user forms various curves and motions while writing their signature. The primary advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is its significantly higher difficulty to replicate.
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"Key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define a false negative in biometric authentication.,A false negative occurs in biometric authentication when a user who is genuinely authorized to access the system is incorrectly rejected by the biometric authentication device.
Define a false positive in biometric authentication.,"A false positive occurs in biometric authentication when an unauthorized individual, an impersonator, successfully gains access to the system by being incorrectly identified as an authorized user."
How does social acceptance factor into biometric authentication techniques?,Social acceptance is a significant consideration when evaluating biometric authentication techniques. It refers to how readily individuals are willing to adopt and use these methods. The document notes that all the discussed biometric authentication techniques are generally less socially accepted than using a password.
What is the primary function of a camera in an iris scan?,"In an iris scan, the primary function of a camera is to capture an image of a person's iris. This image is then used to store certain features of the iris within the system for identification purposes."
What is the role of infrared light in a retina scan?,"In a retina scan, infrared light is used to illuminate the user's eyes. This allows for the detailed reading of the pattern of retinal blood vessels, which is then used to create a unique signature for authentication."
What specific elements of a fingerprint are scanned in fingerprinting?,"In fingerprinting, the reader scans the set of curves that make up a person's fingerprint. These unique patterns of ridges and valleys are used for identification."
How does a computer system process voice for identification?,"For voice identification, a computer system takes the user's spoken phrase and converts it into electrically coded signals. These signals are then compared against a stored database of previous signals to determine if there is a match."
What does a computer system analyze in facial recognition?,"In facial recognition, a computer system analyzes the features of a person's face captured by a camera. This analysis aims to recognize and identify the individual based on these facial characteristics."
What is the advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching?,"The advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate. This is because it captures not only the signature itself but also the dynamic aspects of its creation, such as pressure and timing."
What are the four main disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques mentioned?,"The four main disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques mentioned are: the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
When does a biometric authentication device reject an authentic user?,A biometric authentication device rejects an authentic user when a false negative occurs. This means the system incorrectly identifies a legitimate user as an imposter.
What happens during a false positive in biometric authentication?,"During a false positive in biometric authentication, an impersonator successfully impersonates a user, meaning an unauthorized individual is granted access to the system."
How does an iris scan compare to a palm scan in terms of social acceptance?,Studies indicate that iris scans are more socially acceptable than palm scans.
What is the user interaction required for an iris scan?,"For an iris scan, the user is required to look in a particular direction, allowing a camera to take a quick picture of their iris. This is less intrusive than methods requiring physical contact for extended periods."
What is the mechanism used in a retina scan to capture a signature?,"In a retina scan, infrared light is shot into the user's eyes, and the pattern of retinal blood vessels is read to create a signature that is stored by a computer system."
What is the user's physical action during a retinal scan?,"During a retinal scan, the user places their head in front of a device. The device then proceeds to blow a puff of air and shoot a laser into the user's eye."
Why is fingerprinting considered less socially accepted?,Fingerprinting is considered less socially accepted because people generally associate the act of taking fingerprints with criminal activity.
How does fingerprinting compare to palm scans in terms of information provided?,Fingerprinting provides less information than a palm scan.
What is the initial step in voice identification?,The initial step in voice identification is for a computer to ask a user to say a particular phrase.
What does the computer system compare the user's voice signals to in voice identification?,"In voice identification, the computer system compares the electrically coded signals of the user's voice to a databank of previous signals."
What is the purpose of facial recognition?,The purpose of facial recognition is for a computer system to recognize the features of a person's face after a camera has taken a picture of it.
What information is recorded in signature dynamics?,Signature dynamics records not only a user's signature but also the pressure and timing at which the user makes various curves and motions while writing.
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"The key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques are the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
What is the definition of a false negative in the context of biometric authentication?,A false negative occurs when a user who is indeed an authentic user of the system is rejected by the biometric authentication device.
What is the definition of a false positive in the context of biometric authentication?,"A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a user, meaning an unauthorized individual is granted access."
What is the general social acceptance of biometric authentication techniques compared to passwords?,All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than entering a password.
