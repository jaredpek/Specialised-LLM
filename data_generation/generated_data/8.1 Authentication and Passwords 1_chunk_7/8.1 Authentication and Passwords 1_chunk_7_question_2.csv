What is an iris scan and how does it work?,"An iris scan is a biometric technique that involves scanning a person's iris. In this process, a camera captures an image of the iris and stores certain features from it within a system. This method is considered more socially acceptable than palm scans, and it requires the user to simply look in a particular direction for a quick picture, making it less intrusive than other methods that might require physical contact or prolonged interaction."
Explain the process of a retina scan.,"A retina scan is a biometric technique where infrared light is directed into a user's eyes. The pattern of the retinal blood vessels is then read to create a unique signature that is stored by a computer system. During a retinal scan, the user positions their head in front of a device, which then emits a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye to capture the retinal pattern."
How does fingerprinting work as a biometric technique?,"Fingerprinting as a biometric technique involves a user placing their finger on a reader. This reader scans the unique set of curves that form the fingerprint. However, fingerprinting is not as widely socially accepted as other biometric identification methods because people often associate the taking of fingerprints with criminal activity. Additionally, fingerprinting provides less information compared to a palm scan."
Describe the mechanism of voice identification.,"Voice identification is a biometric mechanism where a computer prompts a user to speak a specific phrase. The computer system then processes the user's voice, converting it into electrically coded signals. These signals are compared against a database of previously recorded signals to determine if there is a sufficiently close match, thereby identifying the user."
What is facial recognition in the context of biometrics?,"Facial recognition, as a biometric technique, involves a camera capturing an image of a person's face. A computer system then analyzes this image to identify and recognize specific features of the face."
What are signature dynamics in biometric authentication?,"Signature dynamics is a biometric technique that goes beyond simply matching a written signature. It records not only the signature itself but also the pressure applied and the timing of the user's movements, including the curves and motions made while writing. The primary advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is its significantly higher difficulty to replicate."
What are the key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques?,"Key disadvantages of biometric authentication techniques include the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
Define a false negative in biometric authentication.,A false negative occurs in biometric authentication when a user who is genuinely authorized to access the system is incorrectly rejected by the biometric authentication device.
Define a false positive in biometric authentication.,"A false positive occurs in biometric authentication when an unauthorized individual, an impersonator, successfully bypasses the system by impersonating a legitimate user."
What is the social acceptance of biometric authentication compared to passwords?,Social acceptance is a significant consideration for biometric authentication techniques. All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are generally less socially accepted than the simple act of entering a password.
How does an iris scan store information?,An iris scan works by a camera taking a picture of a person's iris. This image is then used to store certain unique features of the iris within the system for later comparison and identification.
What technology is used in a retina scan?,"A retina scan utilizes infrared light, which is shot into a user's eyes. This light allows for the reading of the pattern of retinal blood vessels, which is then used to create a signature."
What is the social perception of fingerprinting?,Fingerprinting is not as socially accepted as other biometric identification techniques because people often associate the process of taking fingerprints with criminal activity.
How does voice identification verify a user?,"Voice identification verifies a user by having a computer system compare the electrically coded signals of the user's voice, spoken in response to a prompt, against a databank of previous voice signals. A match is determined if the signals are close enough."
What does facial recognition analyze?,"Facial recognition analyzes the features of a person's face. This is done after a camera takes a picture of the face, and a computer system attempts to recognize these distinct features."
What makes signature dynamics more secure than simple signature matching?,Signature dynamics is more secure than simple signature matching because it records not only the signature itself but also the pressure and timing of the user's writing movements. This detailed information makes it far more difficult for an impersonator to replicate accurately.
What are the main categories of disadvantages for biometric authentication?,"The main categories of disadvantages for biometric authentication are the number of false positives, the number of false negatives, varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
When does a biometric system reject a legitimate user?,"A biometric system rejects a legitimate user when a false negative occurs. This happens when the user is indeed an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device incorrectly denies them access."
What is the consequence of a false positive in biometric authentication?,"The consequence of a false positive in biometric authentication is that an impersonator is successfully able to impersonate a legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to the system."
How does the social acceptance of iris scans compare to palm scans?,Studies indicate that iris scans are more socially acceptable than palm scans.
What is the user interaction required for an iris scan?,"For an iris scan, the user is required to look in a particular direction. A camera then takes a quick picture of the user's iris. This is less intrusive than methods that might require the user to place their hand on a reader for several seconds."
What part of the eye is analyzed in a retina scan?,"In a retina scan, the pattern of retinal blood vessels is analyzed."
What is the process for a retinal scan after the user positions their head?,"After the user positions their head in front of the device for a retinal scan, the device blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye."
What does a fingerprint reader scan?,A fingerprint reader scans the set of curves that make up a user's fingerprint.
What information does fingerprinting provide compared to a palm scan?,Fingerprinting provides less information than a palm scan.
What does a computer ask a user to do in voice identification?,"In voice identification, a computer asks a user to say a particular phrase."
What does the computer system compare in voice identification?,"In voice identification, the computer system compares the electrically coded signals of the user's voice to a databank of previous signals."
What is the primary action in facial recognition?,The primary action in facial recognition involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face.
What does a computer system try to do with facial images?,A computer system tries to recognize the features of a person's face after a picture has been taken.
What does signature dynamics record besides the signature itself?,"Signature dynamics records the pressure and timing at which the user makes various curves and motions while writing, in addition to the signature itself."
What is the main advantage of signature dynamics?,The main advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate.
List the key disadvantages of biometric authentication.,"The key disadvantages of biometric authentication are the number of false positives, the number of false negatives generated, their varying social acceptance, and key management issues."
What is the definition of a false negative in the context of biometric authentication?,A false negative occurs when a biometric authentication device incorrectly rejects a user who is actually an authentic user of the system.
What is the definition of a false positive in the context of biometric authentication?,"A false positive occurs when an impersonator successfully impersonates a user, gaining unauthorized access."
What is the social acceptance of biometric techniques compared to passwords?,All the biometric authentication techniques discussed are less socially accepted than entering a password.
