What is a password?,A password is the most common method used to prove one's identity. It is adopted by various networking websites and applications as a fundamental component of authentication.
How is the security of a password-based authentication mechanism determined?,"The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password. This strength is directly related to the chance an attacker has of guessing the password, with stronger passwords being more difficult to guess."
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize, which makes it convenient for users, but it is also easy for attackers to guess. Conversely, a complex password is strong and difficult to guess, enhancing security, but it often results in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and use."
What defines a weak password?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These passwords lack the complexity and unpredictability needed for robust security."
What are some characteristics of short passwords that make them weak?,"Short passwords are considered weak if they are a single common word (e.g., ""password"") or a simple numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345""). Their brevity and commonality make them highly susceptible to guessing attacks."
How do recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns, such as ""QWERTY"" (which can be found by looking at a standard keyboard layout), contribute to weak passwords because they are predictable and easy for attackers to guess or include in dictionary attacks."
Why is using personal information in a password considered a weakness?,"Using personal information, such as a date of birth, address, or name, in a password is a weakness because this information is often publicly available or easily discoverable through social engineering, making the password highly susceptible to guessing."
What makes repeated letters or numbers a characteristic of a weak password?,"Repeated letters or numbers, such as ""55555"" or ""aaaa"", make a password weak because these simple, repetitive patterns are highly predictable and easy for attackers to include in brute-force or dictionary attacks."
What is the most popular weak password according to the provided data?,"According to the ""Password Popularity â€“ Top 20"" data, the most popular weak password is ""123456"", which was used by 290,731 users."
Which password ranks second in popularity among weak passwords?,"The password ""12345"" ranks second in popularity among weak passwords, with 79,078 users, as indicated by the provided data."
What is the definition of a strong password?,A strong password is defined as a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or for technology to crack. It typically incorporates a variety of character types and avoids predictable patterns.
"What are ""lengthy combinations"" in the context of strong passwords?","""Lengthy combinations"" refer to long passwords that incorporate various character types, such as numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols. An example provided is ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99"", demonstrating a mix of these character types to enhance strength."
How can a mnemonic be used to create a strong password?,"A mnemonic can be used to create a strong password by forming a string of the first letters of a meaningful sentence or phrase that is only notable and memorable to the user. This makes the password unique and difficult for others to guess, as the underlying sentence is personal."
"What are ""non-dictionary words"" in the context of strong passwords?","""Non-dictionary words"" are combinations of characters that are not formal or slang words publicly known and stored in databases. These databases are often accessed by cybercriminals using software to input thousands of passwords per second, so using non-dictionary words makes a password significantly harder to crack."
What is a key requirement for a strong authentication system regarding passwords?,"A key requirement for a strong authentication system is that it mandates users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Additionally, the new passwords must be distinct from any previously used ones to prevent reuse of compromised credentials."
"What are ""tokens"" in the context of authentication?","Tokens are a type of physical possession used for authentication, falling under the category of ""Something You Have."" They are physical devices that generate codes or provide a physical key for access."
Define a smartcard in the context of authentication.,"A smartcard, in the context of authentication, is a physical card that is used in conjunction with a smart card reader to prove identity. It is categorized as a ""Something You Have"" authentication method, leveraging a physical item for security."
What is one significant limitation of using physical belongings for authentication?,One significant limitation of using physical belongings for authentication is that they are easy to get lost. This vulnerability can compromise security if the lost item falls into the wrong hands.
What is two-factor authentication and why is it safer?,"Two-factor authentication is a method that combines a user's knowledge (e.g., a password) with physical belongings (e.g., a token or smartcard) for authentication. It is considered safer because it requires an attacker to compromise two different types of authentication factors, significantly increasing the difficulty of unauthorized access."
"What is the cost implication of using physical belongings for authentication, particularly for large organizations?","The cost implication of using physical belongings for authentication can be high. For example, individual items might cost $15-$25. For large organizations like banks with millions of customers, this can amount to a substantial total expense."
"Besides being lost, what other physical risks are associated with authentication belongings?","Besides being lost, physical authentication belongings are susceptible to damage. Examples include a card being ruined in a washing machine or a device experiencing battery death, rendering it unusable for authentication."
What is a technical limitation of physical belongings as an authentication method?,"A technical limitation of physical belongings as an authentication method is the use of non-standard algorithms. This can lead to issues with interoperability, compatibility, and potentially security vulnerabilities if the algorithms are not robust or widely vetted."
What do biometrics measure?,Biometrics measure some physical characteristic of an individual. These unique biological or behavioral traits are used for identification and authentication purposes.
List examples of biometric authentication methods.,"Examples of biometric authentication methods include fingerprint recognition, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice recognition. These methods utilize distinct physical attributes of an individual."
What are the main advantages of using biometrics for authentication?,The main advantages of using biometrics for authentication are that they can be extremely accurate and fast. This allows for quick and reliable verification of identity.
"Explain the limitation that biometrics are ""private, but not secret.""","The limitation that biometrics are ""private, but not secret"" means that while the physical characteristics are unique to an individual, they can potentially be captured or encoded from everyday interactions. For instance, a fingerprint can be left on a glass or a door handle, making the biometric data accessible and less secret than a password that is intentionally kept confidential."
Why is revocation difficult for biometric authentication?,"Revocation is difficult for biometric authentication because if a biometric characteristic, such as an iris, is compromised, it is not possible to simply ""create a new one"" in the same way a password can be changed. An individual's physical characteristics are generally permanent, making replacement impossible."
What is access control in the context of authorization?,"Access control, in the context of authorization, is the implementation of a security policy. This policy specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and defines the type of access (e.g., read, write, execute) that is permitted in each instance."
What role does access control play between users and system resources?,"Access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources. These system resources include applications, network sockets, and firewalls, with access control ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with them in permitted ways."
What are the three basic elements in a security policy?,"The three basic elements in a security policy are: Subject, Object, and Operations. These elements define who is acting, what they are acting upon, and what actions they can perform."
"Define ""Subject"" in the context of a security policy.","In the context of a security policy, a Subject refers to a process or users who are typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. Subjects are the active entities requesting access to resources."
"Define ""Object"" in the context of a security policy.","In the context of a security policy, an Object is a resource that is security-sensitive. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information, and its access needs to be controlled."
"Define ""Operations"" in the context of a security policy.","In the context of a security policy, Operations refer to the specific actions taken using a particular resource (Object). These actions define what a Subject is permitted to do with an Object, such as reading, writing, or executing."
What is a security policy?,"A security policy is a set of rules that specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource within a computer system, and details the type of access that is permitted in each particular instance. It forms the foundation for access control mechanisms."
Who is typically held accountable for actions initiated by a subject?,A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. This accountability is a core principle in security policies to track and manage resource access.
What are the three types of subjects identified in the document?,"The three types of subjects identified in the document are Owner, Group, and Other. These categories help classify users and processes based on their relationship to resources and assigned privileges."
"Who is an ""Owner"" subject?","An ""Owner"" subject may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. Owners typically have the highest level of control and permissions over their resources."
"How do ""Groups"" function as subjects in terms of privileges?","""Groups"" function as subjects by allowing privileges to be assigned to a collection of users. A user joining a group automatically gains the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting a group loses those permissions. This concept simplifies the management and updating of permissions, and a user can belong to multiple groups."
"What level of access is granted to ""Other"" subjects?","""Other"" subjects are granted the least amount of access. These are users who are able to access the system but are not categorized as an owner or part of a specific group for a particular resource."
What is an object in the context of access control?,"An object in the context of access control is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information, and its access must be managed according to security policies."
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects in a computer system include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs. These are all resources that can be subject to access control."
What are some common system resources that can be considered objects?,"Common system resources that can be considered objects include applications (Apps), memory, databases, hard disks, printers, and network sockets. These are fundamental components of a computer system that require controlled access."
What is the primary function of a password?,"The primary function of a password is to serve as the most common method for a user to prove their identity, acting as a secret piece of information that authenticates them to a system or application."
Why are complex passwords sometimes frustrating for users?,"Complex passwords are sometimes frustrating for users because, while strong and difficult to guess, their intricate nature makes them harder to memorize and accurately input. This difficulty can lead to user inconvenience and frustration."
What is the risk associated with a weak password?,"The risk associated with a weak password is that it is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. This ease of guessing compromises the security of the authentication mechanism, potentially leading to unauthorized access."
"What is the number of users who use ""password"" as their password, according to the popularity list?","According to the ""Password Popularity â€“ Top 20"" list, 61,958 users use ""password"" as their password, making it one of the most common weak passwords."
How often should users change their passwords in a strong authentication system?,"In a strong authentication system, users are typically required to change their passwords periodically, for example, every six months. This regular change helps mitigate the risk of compromised passwords being used over extended periods."
What is the relationship between a physical card and a smart card reader in smartcard authentication?,"In smartcard authentication, a physical card is used in conjunction with a smart card reader. The reader is an essential component that interacts with and processes the information stored on the smartcard, enabling it to function as an authentication factor."
Why is combining users' knowledge with physical belongings considered safer for authentication?,"Combining users' knowledge with physical belongings, known as two-factor authentication, is considered safer because it requires an attacker to compromise two different types of authentication factors: something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a token or smartcard). This significantly increases the difficulty of unauthorized access compared to single-factor methods."
What is the significance of non-dictionary words in creating strong passwords?,"Non-dictionary words are significant in creating strong passwords because they are not publicly known combinations of characters stored in databases that cybercriminals frequently access. Attackers use software to rapidly input thousands of common or dictionary-based passwords, so using non-dictionary words makes a password much harder for these automated attacks to crack."
