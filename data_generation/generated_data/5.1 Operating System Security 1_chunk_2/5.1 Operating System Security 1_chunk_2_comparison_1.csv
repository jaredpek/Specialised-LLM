Compare a weak password with a complex password.,"A **weak password** is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Examples include short passwords (like a single word or numerical phrase, e.g., ""password"" or ""12345""), recognizable keystroke patterns (e.g., ""QWERTY""), personal information (e.g., date of birth, address, name), or repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"").\n\nConversely, a **complex password** (also referred to as a strong password) is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. These often involve lengthy combinations of various character types, such as numbers, letters, and symbols (e.g., ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99""). Strong passwords can also be mnemonic, created from the first letters of a meaningful sentence notable only to the user, or non-dictionary words, which are not publicly known combinations of characters stored in databases accessed by cybercriminals."
What are the differences between password security and convenience?,"**Password security** refers to the strength of a selected password, which dictates the likelihood of an attacker being able to guess it. A strong password is difficult to guess or crack, enhancing security. **Convenience**, in the context of passwords, relates to how easy a password is for a user to remember and use. There is a trade-off between these two aspects: a weak password is easy to memorize but also easy to be guessed, compromising security. A complex password, while strong and secure, can be difficult to remember, potentially leading to frustrated users."
Compare short passwords with lengthy combinations.,"**Short passwords** are a characteristic of weak passwords, typically consisting of a single word (e.g., ""password"") or a numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345""). They are easy to guess by friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software. In contrast, **lengthy combinations** are a characteristic of strong passwords. These are long passwords that incorporate various character types, such as numbers, letters, and symbols (e.g., ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99""), making them difficult for others to guess or for technology to crack."
What are the differences between using recognizable keystroke patterns and non-dictionary words in passwords?,"Using **recognizable keystroke patterns** in passwords, such as ""QWERTY"" (found by looking at a keyboard), is a characteristic of a weak password. Such patterns are easy for others to guess or for password-hacking software to crack. Conversely, **non-dictionary words** are a characteristic of strong passwords. These are combinations of characters that are not formal or slang words publicly known and stored in databases that cybercriminals use. This makes them much harder to guess or crack compared to dictionary words or common patterns."
Compare personal information in passwords with mnemonic passwords.,"Including **personal information** in passwords, such as a date of birth, address, or name, is a characteristic of a weak password. This type of information is often publicly available or easily discoverable, making the password easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. In contrast, **mnemonic passwords** are a method for creating strong passwords. These are passwords inspired by events or information notable only to the user, such as a string of first letters from a meaningful sentence. This makes them unique and difficult for others to guess while potentially being easier for the user to remember than a completely random string."
What are the differences between repeated letters or numbers and unique characters in passwords?,"**Repeated letters or numbers** (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"") are a characteristic of weak passwords. Such patterns are simple and predictable, making them easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. In contrast, **unique characters** are a key component of strong passwords. A strong password is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. The use of varied and unique characters, including numbers, letters, and symbols, significantly increases the password's strength and resistance to guessing or cracking."
Compare the definition of a weak password with that of a strong password.,"A **weak password** is defined as a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Characteristics include short length, recognizable keystroke patterns, personal information, or repeated letters/numbers. Conversely, a **strong password** is defined as a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. Key characteristics include lengthy combinations of various character types (numbers, letters, symbols), mnemonic structures, and the use of non-dictionary words."
What are the differences between tokens and smartcards for authentication?,"**Tokens** are a type of physical possession used for authentication, falling under the category of ""Something You Have."" The document does not provide further specific details on tokens beyond their classification. **Smartcards** are another type of physical possession for authentication, specifically described as a physical card that requires a smart card reader to function. Both are subject to limitations of physical belongings, such as being easy to get lost, high cost, and susceptibility to damage."
Compare password-based authentication with two-factor authentication.,"**Password-based authentication** is a mechanism where a user proves their identity using ""Something You Know,"" specifically a password. Its security depends on the strength of the chosen password, meaning the chance an attacker can guess it. **Two-factor authentication** (2FA) is a more secure method that combines a user's knowledge (like a password) with physical belongings (like a token or smartcard). This approach enhances security by requiring two distinct types of authentication factors, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if one factor is compromised."
What are the differences between password-based authentication and biometric authentication?,"**Password-based authentication** relies on ""Something You Know,"" specifically a password, to prove identity. Its security is directly tied to the password's strength and how difficult it is for an attacker to guess. **Biometric authentication** relies on ""Something You Are,"" measuring some physical characteristic of the user, such as a fingerprint, face, retina, or voice. Biometrics can be extremely accurate and fast. However, while passwords can be changed, biometric data is private but not secret and difficult to revoke if compromised."
Compare the limitations of physical belongings for authentication with the limitations of biometrics.,"The **limitations of physical belongings** for authentication include that they are easy to get lost, can be high cost (e.g., $15-$25 per item for banks with millions of customers), are possible to get damaged (e.g., a card in a washing machine or battery death), and may use non-standard algorithms. The **limitations of biometrics** include that while they are private, they are not secret (e.g., an encoded fingerprint on a glass or door handle), and revocation is difficult (e.g., if an iris is compromised, creating a new one is problematic)."
"What are the differences between biometrics as ""Something You Are"" and passwords as ""Something You Know""?","**Biometrics** represent ""Something You Are,"" meaning they measure a physical characteristic of an individual, such as a fingerprint, face, retina, or voice, to prove identity. This method can be extremely accurate and fast. **Passwords**, on the other hand, represent ""Something You Know,"" which is a piece of information that a user remembers and provides to prove identity. The security of passwords depends on their strength, while biometrics, though private, are not secret and pose challenges for revocation if compromised."
"Compare biometrics being ""private but not secret"" with the implied secrecy of passwords.","**Biometrics** are described as being ""private, but not secret."" This means that while a physical characteristic like a fingerprint or face is unique to an individual, it can potentially be encoded or left behind on surfaces (e.g., glass, door handles), making it accessible to others without the user's explicit intent to share it as a secret. In contrast, **passwords** are inherently secret; their effectiveness as an authentication method relies on them being known only by the legitimate user. The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the chance an attacker *cannot* guess the password, implying its secrecy is paramount."
What are the differences between the difficulty of biometric revocation and password revocation?,"**Biometric revocation** is described as difficult. If a biometric characteristic, such as an iris, is compromised, creating a ""new one"" is problematic due to the inherent and unchangeable nature of physical characteristics. In contrast, **password revocation** is implicitly easier. A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically (e.g., every six months), and the new passwords must be different from the used ones. This process of changing or replacing a password effectively revokes the old one, which is a straightforward action compared to altering a physical biometric trait."
Compare a Subject with an Object in a security policy.,"In a security policy, a **Subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. Subjects can be processes or users. An **Object** is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, applications, memory, databases, hard disks, and printers. The security policy specifies who (Subject) may have access to what (Object) and the type of access permitted."
What are the differences between a Subject and Operations in a security policy?,"In a security policy, a **Subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated and can be a process or a user. **Operations** are the actions taken using a resource (an object). The security policy specifies who (Subject) may have access to a specific resource (Object) and the type of access (Operations) that is permitted in each instance. Essentially, a Subject performs Operations on an Object."
Compare an Object with Operations in a security policy.,"In a security policy, an **Object** is a resource to which access is controlled, serving as an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples include files, databases, or memory. **Operations** are the actions taken using that resource. For instance, if a file is an object, operations might include reading, writing, or executing it. The security policy defines which subjects can perform which operations on which objects."
What are the differences between an Owner subject and a Group subject?,"An **Owner** subject is typically the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. An owner usually has the highest level of control over a resource. A **Group** subject refers to a collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned. When a user joins a group, they automatically gain the corresponding privileges, and when they quit, they lose those permissions. A user can belong to multiple groups, and the concept of groups simplifies managing and updating permissions for multiple users."
Compare an Owner subject with an Other subject.,"An **Owner** subject is typically the creator of a resource, or for system resources, a system administrator. Owners generally possess the most extensive control and permissions over the resource. An **Other** subject refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner or group for a specific resource. These 'Other' users are granted the least amount of access to the resource, reflecting a more restricted level of permission compared to an owner."
What are the differences between a Group subject and an Other subject?,"A **Group** subject refers to a collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned. Users joining a group automatically gain its corresponding privileges, and users quitting a group lose them. This mechanism facilitates easier management and updating of permissions for multiple users. An **Other** subject, in contrast, refers to users who can access the system but are not categorized as either the owner or part of a group for a particular resource. These 'Other' users are granted the least amount of access to the resource, indicating a more limited set of permissions compared to group members."
Compare Access Control with a Security Policy.,"**Access control** is the mechanism that implements a security policy. It mediates between a user (or a process on behalf of a user) and system resources (e.g., applications, network sockets, firewalls). Its function is to specify who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system and the type of access permitted in each instance. A **security policy** is the set of rules that defines these specifications, outlining who or what may have access to resources and the permitted access types. Thus, access control is the enforcement mechanism for the rules defined by a security policy."
What are the differences between password strength based on guessability and password strength based on crackability?,"**Password strength based on guessability** refers to how easily a password can be predicted or inferred by a human, such as a friend or a bad actor. Weak passwords often contain personal information, common words, or simple patterns that are easy for humans to guess. **Password strength based on crackability** refers to how resistant a password is to automated attacks by password-hacking software or technology. Strong passwords, characterized by lengthy combinations of unique characters and non-dictionary words, are designed to be difficult for technology to crack, even when thousands of passwords per second are input."
"Compare password-based authentication with ""Something You Have"" authentication.","**Password-based authentication** falls under the category of ""Something You Know,"" where a user proves identity by providing a secret piece of information they remember. Its security relies on the password's strength against guessing. **""Something You Have"" authentication** relies on physical possessions for identity verification, such as tokens or smartcards. These physical items serve as proof of identity. While passwords are prone to being forgotten or guessed, physical belongings can be lost, damaged, or stolen, and may incur high costs or use non-standard algorithms."
"What are the differences between ""Something You Know"" authentication and ""Something You Have"" authentication?","**""Something You Know"" authentication** relies on a piece of information that only the legitimate user is supposed to know, such as a password. The security of this method depends on the strength of the chosen password, i.e., how difficult it is for an attacker to guess. **""Something You Have"" authentication** relies on physical possessions that only the legitimate user is supposed to possess, such as tokens or smartcards. While these methods provide a different layer of security, they come with limitations like the possibility of being lost, damaged, high cost, and potential use of non-standard algorithms."
"Compare ""Something You Know"" authentication with ""Something You Are"" authentication.","**""Something You Know"" authentication** involves proving identity through knowledge, typically a password. The security of this method is contingent on the password's strength and its resistance to guessing. **""Something You Are"" authentication** involves proving identity through inherent physical characteristics, known as biometrics, such as fingerprints, face recognition, retina scans, or voice. Biometrics offer high accuracy and speed. However, while passwords can be changed, biometric data, though private, is not secret and presents significant challenges for revocation if compromised."
"What are the differences between ""Something You Have"" authentication and ""Something You Are"" authentication?","**""Something You Have"" authentication** relies on physical possessions like tokens or smartcards to verify identity. These methods are subject to limitations such as being easily lost, high cost, susceptibility to damage, and potentially using non-standard algorithms. **""Something You Are"" authentication** relies on biometrics, which measure physical characteristics like fingerprints, face, retina, or voice. Biometrics are highly accurate and fast but have limitations: they are private but not secret, and their revocation is difficult if compromised."
Compare the cost of physical belongings for authentication with the implied cost of passwords.,"The **cost of physical belongings for authentication** can be high, for example, $15-$25 per item for banks serving millions of customers, as mentioned for tokens or smartcards. This represents a tangible financial outlay for the authentication method itself. In contrast, the **implied cost of passwords** is generally minimal or non-existent in terms of direct monetary expense for the user or system to generate or use them. The primary 'cost' associated with passwords is the trade-off between security and convenience, where complex passwords can lead to frustrated users, but not a direct financial cost for the authentication factor itself."
What are the differences between the damageability of physical belongings and the implied damageability of biometrics?,"**Physical belongings** used for authentication, such as smartcards, are susceptible to physical damage. Examples include a card being damaged in a washing machine or a device experiencing battery death. This means the authentication factor itself can be rendered unusable due to physical harm. **Biometrics**, being inherent physical characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, iris), are not 'damaged' in the same way a physical object can be. Instead, the concern with biometrics is their compromise, where they become known or accessible to unauthorized parties (e.g., an iris being compromised), making revocation difficult rather than the characteristic itself being physically damaged."
Compare standard algorithms for passwords with non-standard algorithms for physical belongings.,"The document implies that **password-based authentication** mechanisms, being the most common way to prove identity, rely on widely understood principles of password strength (e.g., resistance to guessing). While not explicitly stated as 'standard algorithms,' the concept of password strength is universally applied. In contrast, **physical belongings** used for authentication, such as tokens or smartcards, are listed as having a limitation of potentially using **non-standard algorithms**. This suggests that the underlying cryptographic or verification processes for some physical authentication devices might not adhere to universally accepted or publicly scrutinized standards, potentially introducing unique vulnerabilities or compatibility issues."
What are the differences between fingerprint recognition and face recognition as biometric methods?,"**Fingerprint recognition** is a biometric method that measures the unique patterns of a person's fingerprint to verify identity. **Face recognition** is another biometric method that identifies individuals by analyzing their unique facial characteristics. Both are types of biometrics, which measure physical characteristics and can be extremely accurate and fast. They share the general limitations of biometrics, such as being private but not secret and difficult to revoke if compromised."
Compare retina scanners with voice recognition as biometric methods.,"**Retina scanners** are a biometric method that identifies individuals by analyzing the unique patterns of blood vessels in the retina of the eye. **Voice recognition** is another biometric method that identifies individuals by analyzing the unique characteristics of their voice. Both fall under the category of biometrics, which measure physical characteristics to prove identity and are noted for being extremely accurate and fast. They are both subject to the limitations of biometrics, including being private but not secret and having difficult revocation processes if compromised."
What are the differences between records as objects and files as objects in a computer system?,"**Records** are identified as a type of object in a computer system, which is a resource to which access is controlled and an entity used to contain and/or receive information. **Files** are also identified as a type of object, serving the same purpose of containing and/or receiving information and having controlled access. While both are fundamental data storage units, records often refer to structured data within a database or a specific entry, whereas files typically refer to a collection of data stored as a single unit on a storage device, which can contain various types of information including records."
Compare directories as objects with programs as objects in a computer system.,"**Directories** (or directory trees) are identified as a type of object in a computer system, which is a resource to which access is controlled and an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Directories primarily serve to organize and store other files and directories. **Programs** are also identified as a type of object, functioning as resources with controlled access that contain and/or receive information. Programs are executable sets of instructions designed to perform specific tasks. Both are critical components of a computer system, but directories manage the structure of stored data, while programs represent the active functionality."
What are the differences between network sockets as objects and memory as objects in a computer system?,"**Network sockets** are identified as a type of object in a computer system, which is a resource to which access is controlled and an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Network sockets are typically used for inter-process communication across a network. **Memory** is also identified as a type of object, serving as a resource with controlled access that contains and/or receives information. Memory refers to the computer's volatile storage where programs and data are actively held for processing. Both are essential resources, but network sockets facilitate communication, while memory provides temporary storage for active operations."
Compare a hard disk as an object with a database as an object in a computer system.,"A **hard disk** is identified as a type of object in a computer system, which is a resource to which access is controlled and an entity used to contain and/or receive information. A hard disk is a physical storage device that stores data persistently. A **database** is also identified as a type of object, serving as a resource with controlled access that contains and/or receives information. A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored electronically in a computer system, often residing on a hard disk. The hard disk is the physical medium, while the database is the structured collection of data managed within that medium."
What are the differences between apps as objects and a printer as an object in a computer system?,"**Apps** (applications) are identified as a type of object in a computer system, which is a resource to which access is controlled and an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Apps are software programs designed to perform specific tasks for users. A **printer** is also identified as a type of object, serving as a resource with controlled access that contains and/or receives information. A printer is a peripheral device that produces a hard copy of electronic data. Both are resources within a computer system, but apps are software components that execute tasks, while a printer is a hardware component that provides output."
Compare the definition of a Security Policy with the definition of Access Control.,"A **security policy** is a set of rules that specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and the type of access that is permitted in each instance. It defines the overarching security requirements. **Access control** is the implementation mechanism for this security policy. It mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources (e.g., applications, network sockets, firewalls) to enforce the rules laid out by the security policy, ensuring that only authorized subjects can perform permitted operations on objects."
What are the differences between a user as a subject and a process as a subject in a security policy?,"In a security policy, a **subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. A subject can be either a **user** or a **process** executing on behalf of a user. A user refers to a human individual interacting with the system. A process refers to an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Both users and processes can initiate actions and require access to system resources, and the security policy defines their permitted access and operations on objects."
Compare privileges for individual users with privileges for groups of users.,"**Privileges for individual users** are permissions assigned directly to a single user, allowing them specific access and operations on resources. **Privileges for groups of users** are permissions assigned to a collective entity (a group). When a user joins such a group, they automatically inherit all the corresponding privileges assigned to that group. Conversely, if a user quits the group, they lose those permissions. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions for multiple users simultaneously, rather than managing each individual's privileges separately."
What are the differences between password guessing by friends/bad actors and password cracking by technology?,"**Password guessing by friends/bad actors** refers to attempts by human adversaries to deduce a password, often by exploiting common patterns, personal information, or social engineering. Weak passwords are easy for humans to guess. **Password cracking by technology** refers to automated attempts by software, often used by cybercriminals, to discover passwords by inputting thousands of passwords per second from databases of known combinations (like dictionary words or previously compromised passwords). Strong passwords are designed to be difficult for both human guessing and technological cracking."
Compare password security with biometric security.,"**Password security** depends on the strength of the selected password, specifically the chance an attacker can guess it. Strong passwords are long combinations of unique characters, difficult to guess or crack. **Biometric security** relies on measuring physical characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, face, retina, voice) which can be extremely accurate and fast. However, biometrics are private but not secret, meaning they can be encoded or left behind, and their revocation is difficult if compromised, unlike passwords which can be periodically changed."
What are the differences between password memorization and biometric memorization?,"**Password memorization** refers to the user's ability to recall their password. There's a trade-off: weak passwords are easy to memorize but insecure, while complex passwords are strong but can result in frustrated users due to difficulty in memorization. **Biometric memorization** is not applicable in the same way. Biometrics are inherent physical characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, face, retina, voice) that are measured for authentication; users do not need to 'memorize' them. The challenge with biometrics is their 'secrecy' and 'revocation' rather than memorization."
Compare password periodicity requirements with biometric revocation difficulty.,"**Password periodicity requirements** refer to the need for users to change their password periodically (e.g., every six months), with new passwords needing to be different from old ones. This is a feature of a strong authentication system, allowing for regular updates and invalidation of potentially compromised passwords. **Biometric revocation difficulty** refers to the challenge of invalidating a compromised biometric characteristic. If an iris, for example, is compromised, creating a ""new one"" is problematic because physical characteristics are inherent and generally unchangeable, making it hard to replace a compromised biometric identifier."
What are the differences between dictionary words and non-dictionary words in passwords?,"**Dictionary words** are formal or slang words that are publicly known combinations of characters. These are often stored in databases that cybercriminals access using software to input thousands of passwords per second, making passwords containing dictionary words weak and easy to crack. **Non-dictionary words** are combinations of characters that are not publicly known words. Using non-dictionary words is a characteristic of a strong password, as it makes them significantly more difficult for technology to crack compared to passwords based on common vocabulary."
Compare a password-based authentication mechanism with a strong authentication system.,"A **password-based authentication mechanism** is the most common way to prove identity, where security depends on the strength of the selected password, i.e., the chance an attacker can guess it. This mechanism inherently involves a trade-off between security (strong password) and convenience (easy to memorize). A **strong authentication system** goes beyond just password strength. It requires users to change their password periodically (e.g., every six months) and mandates that new passwords must be different from the used ones. This implies a more comprehensive approach to maintaining security over time, not just at the point of password creation."
What are the differences between the role of a Subject and the role of an Object in a security policy?,"In a security policy, the **role of a Subject** is to initiate actions and be held accountable for them. Subjects are typically processes or users who request access to resources. The **role of an Object** is to be the resource to which access is controlled. Objects are entities that contain or receive information, such as files, databases, or memory. The security policy defines which Subjects are permitted to access which Objects and what types of operations they can perform."
Compare the role of an Owner with the role of a Group in managing resource permissions.,"The **role of an Owner** in managing resource permissions is typically that of the creator of a resource, or a system administrator for system resources. Owners usually have the highest level of control and permissions over that specific resource. The **role of a Group** in managing resource permissions is to provide a collective mechanism for assigning privileges. Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, privileges are assigned to a group. Users who join the group automatically gain these permissions, and those who quit lose them. This simplifies the management and updating of permissions for multiple users who require similar access."
What are the differences between the access level of a Group and the access level of Other users for a resource?,"The **access level of a Group** for a resource is determined by the privileges assigned to that group. Users who are members of the group automatically receive these corresponding privileges, which can be substantial depending on the group's role. The **access level of Other users** for a resource refers to users who can access the system but are not categorized as the owner or part of any group for that specific resource. These 'Other' users are granted the least amount of access, indicating a highly restricted set of permissions compared to group members."
Compare the characteristics of a weak password with the characteristics of a strong password.,"**Weak passwords** are characterized by being easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Their characteristics include being short (e.g., single words or numerical phrases like ""12345""), containing recognizable keystroke patterns (e.g., ""QWERTY""), incorporating personal information (e.g., date of birth, name), or using repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555""). In contrast, **strong passwords** are characterized by being long combinations of unique characters that are difficult for others to guess or technology to crack. Their characteristics include lengthy combinations of various character types (numbers, letters, symbols, e.g., ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99""), being mnemonic (inspired by personal events), and consisting of non-dictionary words."
What are the security implications of using personal information in passwords versus using non-dictionary words?,"The **security implications of using personal information in passwords** are that it makes the password weak and highly susceptible to guessing. Personal information, such as date of birth, address, or name, is often publicly available or easily discoverable, allowing friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to easily deduce the password. This significantly compromises security. In contrast, the **security implications of using non-dictionary words** are that it makes the password strong and difficult for technology to crack. Non-dictionary words are not publicly known combinations of characters stored in databases used by cybercriminals, thereby greatly enhancing the password's resistance to automated attacks and improving overall security."
Compare the security of a password that is easy to memorize with one that is difficult to memorize.,"A password that is **easy to memorize** is typically a weak password. These are often short, contain personal information, or use simple patterns, making them easy for the user to recall. However, this ease of memorization comes at the cost of security, as such passwords are also easy for attackers to guess. Conversely, a password that is **difficult to memorize** is typically a complex or strong password. These are long combinations of unique characters, often including various types like numbers, letters, and symbols. While they offer high security by being difficult for attackers to guess or crack, their complexity can result in frustrated users who struggle to remember them."
What are the differences between a password that is easy to be guessed and one that is difficult to be cracked?,"A password that is **easy to be guessed** is typically a weak password, characterized by simplicity, common patterns, or personal information. These are susceptible to human attempts at deduction by friends or bad actors. A password that is **difficult to be cracked** is a strong password, characterized by lengthy combinations of unique characters and non-dictionary words. These are resistant to automated attacks by password-hacking software that can input thousands of passwords per second. While an easy-to-guess password is also likely easy to crack, a password difficult to crack is inherently also difficult to guess by humans."
Compare the security implications of a password being a single word versus a long combination of unique characters.,"If a password is a **single word**, it is considered a short password and a characteristic of a weak password. Such passwords are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess, significantly compromising security. In contrast, if a password is a **long combination of unique characters**, it is considered a strong password. This type of password is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack, as it incorporates various character types like numbers, letters, and symbols, thereby providing a much higher level of security."
What are the differences between a password inspired by a meaningful sentence and one based on a recognizable keystroke pattern?,"A password inspired by a **meaningful sentence** is a mnemonic password, a characteristic of a strong password. It involves using a string of first letters from a sentence notable only to the user, making it unique and difficult for others to guess while being potentially easier for the user to remember. Conversely, a password based on a **recognizable keystroke pattern**, such as ""QWERTY,"" is a characteristic of a weak password. These patterns are easily identifiable on a keyboard and are simple for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess, significantly reducing security."
Compare the security of using a password from the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' list with using a randomly generated strong password.,"Using a password from the **'Password Popularity – Top 20' list** (e.g., ""123456"", ""password"", ""iloveyou"") carries extremely low security. These passwords are publicly known to be popular and are therefore among the first an attacker would try, making them very easy to guess or crack. In contrast, using a **randomly generated strong password** would involve a long combination of unique characters, including numbers, letters, and symbols, that is not based on dictionary words or personal information. Such a password is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack, offering significantly higher security."
What are the differences between the security provided by a password and the security provided by a physical card with a smart card reader?,"The **security provided by a password** relies on ""Something You Know."" Its effectiveness depends on the password's strength, meaning how difficult it is for an attacker to guess. Passwords can be weak if they are simple or contain personal information, or strong if they are complex and unique. The **security provided by a physical card with a smart card reader** relies on ""Something You Have."" This method offers a different layer of security, as it requires physical possession of the card. However, it has its own limitations, such as the card being easy to get lost, high cost, susceptibility to damage, and potential use of non-standard algorithms. Combining both (password and smartcard) would constitute two-factor authentication, enhancing overall security."
Compare the ease of getting lost for physical belongings with the 'private but not secret' nature of biometrics.,"The **ease of getting lost for physical belongings** (like tokens or smartcards) means that the authentication factor itself can be misplaced, stolen, or simply forgotten, rendering it unavailable for authentication. This is a direct physical vulnerability. The **'private but not secret' nature of biometrics** means that while a physical characteristic (e.g., fingerprint, face) is unique to an individual, it can inadvertently be left behind or encoded on surfaces (e.g., glass, door handles). This makes the biometric data potentially accessible to others without the user's knowledge or consent, even though it's not a 'secret' in the way a password is meant to be kept."
What are the differences between a security policy that specifies 'who' and one that specifies 'what' in access control?,"A security policy that specifies **'who'** refers to identifying the subjects that may have access to a resource. This typically involves processes or users, and can further differentiate between owners, groups, and other users, each with varying levels of accountability and permissions. A security policy that specifies **'what'** refers to identifying the objects to which access is controlled. These are the resources themselves, such as files, databases, memory, or applications, which contain or receive information. Both 'who' and 'what' are fundamental elements of a security policy, defining the subjects and the resources involved in access control."
Compare the security implications of a password being easy to memorize versus being easy to be guessed.,"A password being **easy to memorize** is a characteristic that directly impacts user convenience. While it makes the password simple for the legitimate user to recall, it often correlates with the password being weak. A password being **easy to be guessed** is a direct security vulnerability. This means the password can be easily predicted by friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software, regardless of how easy it is for the user to remember. While an easy-to-memorize password is often easy to guess, the core difference lies in the perspective: one is about user experience, the other is about attacker success."
What are the differences between the security of a password that is a single word and one that is a numerical phrase?,"Both a password that is a **single word** (e.g., ""password"") and one that is a **numerical phrase** (e.g., ""12345"") are characteristics of weak passwords. They are both considered short passwords and are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. The security implications are similar: both types of passwords offer very low security due to their simplicity and predictability, making them highly vulnerable to attacks. The distinction is merely in the character type (alphabetic vs. numeric) rather than a significant difference in security strength."
Compare the security of using a date of birth in a password with using a string of first letters of a meaningful sentence.,"Using a **date of birth in a password** is a characteristic of a weak password because it falls under personal information. Such information is often publicly available or easily discoverable, making the password easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess, thus compromising security. In contrast, using a **string of first letters of a meaningful sentence** is a mnemonic technique for creating a strong password. This method generates a unique combination of characters inspired by an event or sentence known only to the user, making it difficult for others to guess while potentially aiding the user's memorization, thereby enhancing security."
What are the differences between the security of using '55555' in a password and using 'N0r+Hc^R0|in^99'?,"Using **'55555' in a password** is an example of repeated numbers, which is a characteristic of a weak password. Such patterns are simple and highly predictable, making the password extremely easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess, offering very low security. In stark contrast, using **'N0r+Hc^R0|in^99'** is an example of a lengthy combination of various character types (numbers, letters, and symbols), which is a characteristic of a strong password. This complex mix makes the password difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack, providing a high level of security."
Compare the security of a password that is easy to be guessed by friends versus one that is easy to be guessed by password-hacking software.,"A password that is **easy to be guessed by friends** implies that it contains easily discernible information, such as personal details or common patterns that a human might deduce. This indicates a fundamental weakness in the password's construction. A password that is **easy to be guessed by password-hacking software** means it is vulnerable to automated attacks that can rapidly test thousands of combinations, often using dictionaries or common password lists. While a password easy for friends to guess is almost certainly easy for software to guess, the latter emphasizes the technological threat, where the volume and speed of attempts are far greater than human efforts, making even slightly less obvious weak passwords vulnerable."
"What are the differences between a password that is easy to memorize but easy to be guessed, and a complex password that is strong but results in frustrated users?","A password that is **easy to memorize but easy to be guessed** represents the convenience side of the password security trade-off. Such a password is simple for the user to recall, but its simplicity makes it a weak password, highly vulnerable to being compromised by attackers. A **complex password that is strong but results in frustrated users** represents the security side of the trade-off. This password is difficult for attackers to guess or crack due to its unique and lengthy character combinations, providing high security. However, its complexity makes it hard for users to memorize, leading to a poor user experience."
Compare the security implications of a password being '123456' versus 'Qwerty'.,"Both **'123456'** and **'Qwerty'** are examples of weak passwords listed in the 'Password Popularity – Top 20'. '123456' is a short numerical phrase and an example of repeated numbers/sequential patterns, while 'Qwerty' is a recognizable keystroke pattern. The security implications for both are very poor: they are extremely easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess or crack due to their commonality and predictability. Neither offers meaningful security, and both are highly vulnerable to compromise."
