What is a password and its primary function?,A password is the most common way to prove who you are. It is adopted by various networking websites and applications to authenticate users.
How is the security of a password-based authentication mechanism determined?,"The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password, which refers to the chance an attacker can guess the password."
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"The trade-off between password security and convenience is that a weak password is easy to memorize but also easy to be guessed, while a complex password is strong but often results in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and input."
What are the characteristics of a weak password in terms of memorability and guessability?,A weak password is easy to memorize but also easy to be guessed by others or password-hacking software.
What are the characteristics of a complex password in terms of strength and user experience?,"A complex password is strong, meaning it is difficult for others or technology to crack, but it can result in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and use."
What defines a weak password?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess."
Provide examples of characteristics that make a password weak.,"Characteristics that make a password weak include short passwords (e.g., a single word like ""password"" or a numerical phrase like ""12345""), recognizable keystroke patterns (e.g., ""QWERTY""), personal information (e.g., date of birth, address, name), and repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"")."
"What are ""short passwords"" in the context of weak passwords?","Short passwords are a type of weak password characterized by being a single word (e.g., ""password"") or a numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345"")."
How do recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns, such as ""QWERTY"" found on a keyboard, contribute to weak passwords because they are easy for others or software to guess."
Why is using personal information in passwords considered a weakness?,"Using personal information in passwords, such as date of birth, address, or name, is considered a weakness because this information can often be easily discovered by attackers, making the password simple to guess."
List the top 5 most popular passwords according to the provided data.,"The top 5 most popular passwords are: ""123456"", ""12345"", ""123456789"", ""Password"", and ""iloveyou""."

"What is the 20th most popular password listed in the ""Password Popularity â€“ Top 20"" table?","The 20th most popular password listed is ""Qwerty""."
What is a strong password?,A strong password is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack.
"Describe ""lengthy combinations"" as a characteristic of strong passwords.","Lengthy combinations refer to long passwords that incorporate various character types, such as numbers, letters, and symbols. An example provided is ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99""."
"Explain the ""mnemonic"" approach to creating strong passwords.","The mnemonic approach to creating strong passwords involves creating passwords inspired by events only notable to the user, typically by taking a string of the first letters of a meaningful sentence."
"What are ""non-dictionary words"" in the context of strong passwords?","Non-dictionary words are combinations of characters that are not formal words or slang. Dictionary words, which are publicly known combinations, are stored in databases that cybercriminals access using software to input thousands of passwords per second. Therefore, using non-dictionary words makes passwords harder to crack."
What are the requirements for a strong authentication system regarding password management?,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Additionally, the new passwords must be different from any previously used ones."
How often should users change their password in a strong authentication system?,"In a strong authentication system, users are required to change their password periodically, such as every six months."
What is the rule for new passwords in a strong authentication system?,"In a strong authentication system, new passwords must be different from the used ones."
What are the different types of physical possessions used for authentication?,The different types of physical possessions used for authentication are Tokens and Smartcards.
"Define ""Tokens"" in the context of authentication.",Tokens are a type of physical possession used for authentication. The document does not provide a further specific definition beyond classifying them as a type of possession.
"Define ""Smartcards"" in the context of authentication.","Smartcards are a type of physical possession used for authentication, consisting of a physical card combined with a smart card reader."
What are the limitations of using physical belongings for authentication?,"The limitations of using physical belongings for authentication include that they are easy to get lost, can be high cost (e.g., $15-$25 for banks with millions of customers), are possible to get damaged (e.g., a card in the washing machine or battery death), and may use non-standard algorithms."
What is two-factor authentication and why is it considered safer?,"Two-factor authentication is a security method that combines a user's knowledge with physical belongings. This approach is considered safer because it adds an additional layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access even if one factor is compromised."
"What is the approximate cost associated with physical belongings for authentication, particularly for large organizations?","The approximate cost associated with physical belongings for authentication can be high, for example, $15-$25, especially for large organizations like banks with millions of customers."
How can physical belongings used for authentication become damaged?,"Physical belongings used for authentication can become damaged in various ways, such as a smartcard being put in a washing machine or a device experiencing battery death."
What is a limitation related to the algorithms used with physical belongings for authentication?,A limitation related to the algorithms used with physical belongings for authentication is that they may employ non-standard algorithms.
What do biometrics measure?,Biometrics measure some physical characteristic of an individual.
Provide examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication.,"Examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication include fingerprint, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice."
What are the advantages of using biometrics for authentication?,The advantages of using biometrics for authentication are that they can be extremely accurate and fast.
What are the limitations of biometrics?,"The limitations of biometrics include that they are private but not secret (meaning they can be encoded on objects like glass or door handles), and revocation is difficult (e.g., if an iris is compromised, creating a new one is not possible)."
"Why are biometrics considered ""private, but not secret""?","Biometrics are considered ""private, but not secret"" because while they are personal characteristics, they can potentially be captured or encoded on everyday objects like glass or door handles, making them accessible to others."
Explain why revocation is difficult for biometrics.,"Revocation is difficult for biometrics because if a biometric characteristic, such as an iris, is compromised, it is not possible to simply ""create a new one"" like a password. The physical characteristic is unique and permanent."
What is access control in the context of authorization?,"Access control is the implementation of a security policy that specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and the type of access that is permitted in each instance."
What is the purpose of a security policy in access control?,"The purpose of a security policy in access control is to specify who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and to define the type of access that is permitted in each instance."
How does access control mediate between a user and system resources?,"Access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources, which include applications, network sockets, and firewalls."
What are the three basic elements in a security policy?,"The three basic elements in a security policy are Subject, Object, and Operations."
"Define ""Subject"" as an element in a security policy.","In a security policy, a Subject refers to a process or users."
"Define ""Object"" as an element in a security policy.","In a security policy, an Object refers to a resource that is security-sensitive."
"Define ""Operations"" as an element in a security policy.","In a security policy, Operations refer to the actions taken using a particular resource."
What is a subject in the context of authorization?,A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated.
What are the three types of subjects?,"The three types of subjects are Owner, Group, and Other."
"Define ""Owner"" as a type of subject.","An Owner is a type of subject who may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator."
"Define ""Group"" as a type of subject and explain its benefits.","A Group is a type of subject where privileges can be assigned to a collection of users in addition to individual users. A user joining the group automatically gains the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group loses those permissions. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions."
"Define ""Other"" as a type of subject.",Other is a type of subject referring to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. They are granted the least amount of access.
How do privileges change for users when joining or quitting a group?,"When a user joins a group, they automatically receive the corresponding privileges assigned to that group. Conversely, when a user quits a group, they lose the corresponding permissions."
"What level of access is typically granted to ""Other"" subjects?","The least amount of access is typically granted to ""Other"" subjects, who are users able to access the system but are not categorized as an owner or part of a group for a specific resource."
What is an object in the context of access control?,An object is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects in a computer system include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, applications (Apps), network sockets, memory, hard disks, printers, and databases."
