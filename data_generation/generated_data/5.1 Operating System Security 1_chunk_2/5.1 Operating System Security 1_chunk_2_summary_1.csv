What is the most common way to prove identity according to the document?,The most common way to prove identity is through a password. A **password** is a secret word or phrase that must be used to gain admission to something.
Summarize the security of password-based authentication.,The security of a password-based authentication mechanism is directly dependent on the strength of the selected password. This refers to the likelihood that an attacker can successfully guess the password. A stronger password reduces the chance of unauthorized access.
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a significant trade-off between password security and convenience. A **weak password** is easy to memorize but is also easy for others to guess, compromising security. Conversely, a **complex password** is strong and difficult to guess, offering better security, but it often results in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and input."
Describe the characteristics of a weak password in terms of memorability and guessability.,"A weak password is characterized by being easy to memorize, which unfortunately also makes it easy to be guessed by others, including bad actors or password-hacking software. This ease of memorization and guessability compromises its security effectiveness."
Describe the characteristics of a complex password in terms of strength and user experience.,"A complex password is characterized by its strength, meaning it is difficult for others to guess or for technology to crack. However, this strength often comes at the cost of user convenience, as complex passwords can be hard to memorize and manage, leading to frustrated users."
Provide a definition of a weak password.,"A **weak password** is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These passwords lack sufficient complexity or uniqueness to withstand common guessing attempts."
List and describe the characteristics that make a password weak.,"Passwords are considered weak if they exhibit certain characteristics:
1.  **Short passwords**: These are single words (e.g., ""password"") or simple numerical phrases (e.g., ""12345"").
2.  **Recognizable keystroke patterns**: These are sequences found easily on a keyboard (e.g., ""QWERTY"").
3.  **Personal information**: Passwords that include personal details like date of birth, address, or name.
4.  **Repeated letters or numbers**: Passwords consisting of repetitive characters (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"")."
Explain how recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords.,"Recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords because they are easy to identify and guess, often by simply looking at a keyboard. An example is ""QWERTY,"" which is the sequence of the first six keys on the top row of a standard English keyboard. Such patterns are predictable and can be easily exploited by attackers."
Discuss the use of personal information in passwords and why it makes them weak.,"The use of personal information in passwords, such as a date of birth, address, or name, makes them weak because this information is often publicly available or easily discoverable by attackers. This predictability allows bad actors to guess such passwords more readily, compromising account security."
Describe how repeated letters or numbers make a password weak.,"Repeated letters or numbers make a password weak because they are highly predictable and simple patterns. Examples like ""55555"" or ""aaaa"" are easy for humans to guess and for password-hacking software to crack quickly, as they lack the complexity and randomness needed for strong security."
List the top 5 most popular weak passwords according to the provided data.,"According to the provided data, the top 5 most popular weak passwords are:
1.  ""123456""
2.  ""12345""
3.  ""123456789""
4.  ""Password""
5.  ""iloveyou"""
Identify the password with the highest number of users.,"The password with the highest number of users is ""123456"", with 290,731 users."
"Identify the password ""Qwerty"" and its popularity rank.","The password ""Qwerty"" is ranked 20th in popularity, with 13,856 users."
"How many users use ""Password"" as their password?","61,958 users use ""Password"" as their password."
"What is the number of users for ""123456789""?","The number of users for ""123456789"" is 76,790."
Provide a definition of a strong password.,A **strong password** is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or for technology to crack. It incorporates various character types to enhance its security.
Describe the characteristics of lengthy combination passwords.,"Lengthy combination passwords are a characteristic of strong passwords. They are long passwords that incorporate various character types, such as numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols. An example provided is ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99"", which demonstrates a mix of these character types to increase complexity and difficulty in guessing."
Explain the mnemonic approach to creating strong passwords.,"The mnemonic approach to creating strong passwords involves generating passwords inspired by events or information only notable to the user. This often takes the form of a string of the first letters of a meaningful sentence, making it easier for the user to remember while remaining complex and unique to outsiders."
Define non-dictionary words in the context of strong passwords.,"In the context of strong passwords, **non-dictionary words** refer to combinations of characters that are not formal or slang words found in publicly known databases. **Dictionary words**, whether formal or slang, are stored in databases that cybercriminals access using software to input thousands of passwords per second. By avoiding these, a password becomes significantly harder to crack."
Summarize the requirements for a strong authentication system.,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Additionally, a critical requirement is that the new passwords must be different from any previously used ones, preventing users from cycling through a small set of old passwords."
What is the recommended frequency for changing passwords in a strong authentication system?,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, with an example frequency given as every six months."
What is a key requirement for new passwords in a strong authentication system?,"A key requirement for new passwords in a strong authentication system is that they must be different from any previously used passwords. This prevents users from reusing old, potentially compromised, passwords."
What are the different types of physical possessions used for authentication?,The different types of physical possessions used for authentication include **Tokens** and **Smartcards**. A **Token** is a physical device used to prove identity. A **Smartcard** is a physical card that requires a smart card reader to function for authentication purposes.
"Define ""Tokens"" as a type of physical possession for authentication.","**Tokens** are a type of physical possession used for authentication. They are physical devices that users possess to prove their identity, often generating one-time passwords or codes."
"Define ""Smartcards"" as a type of physical possession for authentication.","**Smartcards** are a type of physical possession used for authentication, consisting of a physical card that requires a dedicated smart card reader to interact with and verify identity."
Explain the concept of two-factor authentication.,"**Two-factor authentication** is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. It is considered safer to combine a user's knowledge (like a password) with physical belongings (like a token or smartcard) to enhance security, as losing one factor is not enough for unauthorized access."
Summarize the limitations of using physical belongings for authentication.,"The limitations of using physical belongings for authentication include:
1.  **Easy to get lost**: Physical items can be misplaced, making authentication impossible.
2.  **High cost**: Implementing and distributing physical belongings can be expensive, especially for large organizations (e.g., $15-$25 per item for banks with millions of customers).
3.  **Possible to get damaged**: Physical items can be damaged (e.g., a card in a washing machine, battery death in a token), rendering them unusable.
4.  **Non-standard algorithms**: Some physical belongings might rely on proprietary or less common algorithms, which could pose interoperability or security review challenges."
Discuss the cost implications of using physical belongings for authentication.,"The cost implications of using physical belongings for authentication can be significant. For instance, the cost per item can range from $15 to $25. For organizations like banks with millions of customers, this can accumulate into a very high overall expense for deployment and maintenance."
"Describe how physical belongings can be damaged, affecting authentication.","Physical belongings used for authentication can be damaged in various ways, rendering them ineffective. Examples include a smartcard being damaged if put through a washing machine, or an electronic token becoming unusable due to battery death. Such damage directly impacts the user's ability to authenticate."
"What are ""Non-standard algorithms"" in the context of physical belongings for authentication?","In the context of physical belongings for authentication, ""non-standard algorithms"" refer to authentication algorithms that are not widely adopted or publicly vetted. This can lead to potential security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues compared to using established, standardized cryptographic methods."
What do biometrics measure for authentication?,**Biometrics** measure some physical characteristic of an individual for authentication. These characteristics are unique to each person and can be used to verify their identity.
List examples of biometrics used for authentication.,"Examples of biometrics used for authentication include fingerprint, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice recognition. These are all unique physical characteristics that can be measured to verify identity."
Discuss the advantages of biometrics in terms of accuracy and speed.,"Biometrics offer significant advantages in terms of accuracy and speed for authentication. They can be extremely accurate in identifying individuals based on unique physical characteristics and can process this information very quickly, leading to fast authentication processes."
Summarize the limitations of biometrics.,"The limitations of biometrics include:
1.  **Private, but not secret**: While biometric data is personal, it is not inherently secret. It can potentially be encoded on everyday objects like a glass or a door handle, making it accessible.
2.  **Revocation is difficult**: If a biometric characteristic is compromised (e.g., an iris scan), it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to revoke or ""create a new one"" unlike a password. This poses a significant challenge for long-term security."
"Explain why biometrics are considered ""private, but not secret.""","Biometrics are considered ""private, but not secret"" because while they are unique to an individual's physical characteristics, they are not inherently confidential in the same way a password is. For example, a fingerprint or iris pattern could potentially be captured or encoded from everyday interactions or surfaces, such as a glass or a door handle, without the individual's direct knowledge or consent, making them accessible to others."
Describe the difficulty of revoking a compromised biometric.,"The difficulty of revoking a compromised biometric stems from the fact that physical characteristics are permanent and cannot be changed. If a biometric, such as an iris scan, is compromised, it is not possible to simply ""create a new one"" like a password. This means that once compromised, that particular biometric factor may be permanently insecure for authentication, posing a significant challenge for long-term security."
Provide a comprehensive summary of Authorization.,"**Authorization** is the process of implementing a **security policy** that specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and the type of access that is permitted in each instance. It mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources, such as applications, network sockets, and firewalls. A **security policy** is a set of rules that dictates how access to resources is controlled."
Define Access Control.,**Access control** is the mechanism used to implement a security policy. It specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system and defines the type of access permitted in each instance. It mediates between users (or processes acting for users) and system resources like applications and network components.
Explain the role of Access Control in mediating between users and system resources.,"Access control plays a crucial role in mediating between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources. It acts as a gatekeeper, enforcing the security policy by determining which users or processes are allowed to interact with specific resources, such as applications, network sockets, or firewalls, and what actions they are permitted to perform on those resources."
List the three basic elements in a security policy.,"The three basic elements in a security policy are:
1.  **Subject**: The process or users attempting to access a resource.
2.  **Object**: The resource that is security-sensitive.
3.  **Operations**: The actions taken using that resource."
"Define ""Subject"" in the context of a security policy.","In the context of a security policy, a **Subject** refers to the process or users who are attempting to access a resource. They are typically held accountable for the actions they initiate within the system."
"Define ""Object"" in the context of a security policy.","In the context of a security policy, an **Object** is defined as a resource that is security-sensitive. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information, and access to it is controlled by the security policy."
"Define ""Operations"" in the context of a security policy.","In the context of a security policy, **Operations** refer to the specific actions that can be taken using a particular resource (object). These actions are governed by the security policy, which dictates what a subject is permitted to do with an object."
"Explain who a ""Subject"" is and what they are accountable for.","A **Subject** is typically a process or a user within a system. They are held accountable for the actions they have initiated. This means that any activity performed by a subject is traceable back to them, and they bear responsibility for those actions according to the system's security policies."
List the three types of subjects.,"There can be three types of subjects:
1.  **Owner**
2.  **Group**
3.  **Other**"
"Define an ""Owner"" subject.","An **Owner** subject is typically the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. The owner usually has the highest level of control and privileges over the resource they own."
"Describe the ""Group"" subject type, including how privileges are assigned and managed.","A **Group** subject type allows privileges to be assigned to a collection of users, in addition to individual users. When a user joins a group, they automatically inherit the corresponding privileges associated with that group. Conversely, if a user quits the group, they lose those permissions. A user can belong to multiple groups. The concept of groups simplifies the management and updating of permissions, as changes made to a group's privileges apply to all its members."
"Explain the ""Other"" subject type and the level of access granted to them.","The **Other** subject type refers to users who are able to access the system but are not categorized as either an owner or part of a group for a specific resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access or privileges to that resource, ensuring a baseline level of security for those outside the primary access categories."
"Provide a comprehensive definition of an ""Object"" in access control.","In access control, an **Object** is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Access control mechanisms regulate which subjects can interact with these objects and what operations they can perform on them, based on a defined security policy."
List various examples of objects that are resources to which access is controlled.,"Various examples of objects that are resources to which access is controlled include:
*   Records
*   Blocks
*   Pages
*   Segments
*   Files
*   Portions of files
*   Directories
*   Directory trees
*   Mailboxes
*   Messages
*   Programs
*   Network sockets
*   Memory
*   Hard disks
*   Printers
*   Databases
*   Applications (Apps)"
