What is a password and what is its primary purpose?,"A password is the most common way to prove who you are. Its primary purpose is to serve as a password-based authentication mechanism, adopted by various networking websites and applications, to verify a user's identity."
How is the security of a password-based authentication mechanism determined?,The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password. This strength is inversely proportional to the chance an attacker can guess the password; a stronger password is more difficult for an attacker to guess.
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize, which makes it convenient for users, but it is also easy to be guessed by attackers, compromising security. Conversely, a complex password is strong, offering better security, but it can be difficult to remember, leading to frustrated users."
What are the characteristics of a weak password?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Characteristics include short passwords (a single word or numerical phrase like ""password"" or ""12345""), recognizable keystroke patterns (like ""QWERTY""), personal information (such as date of birth, address, or name), and repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"")."
Provide examples of short passwords that are considered weak.,"Examples of short passwords that are considered weak include a single word, such as ""password,"" or a numerical phrase, such as ""12345."" These are easy to guess due to their simplicity and common usage."
What are recognizable keystroke patterns in the context of weak passwords?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns in the context of weak passwords are character sequences that can be easily found on a keyboard, such as ""QWERTY."" These patterns are simple to identify and guess, making them insecure."
How does personal information contribute to a password being weak?,"Personal information contributes to a password being weak when it includes details such as a user's date of birth, address, or name. This information is often publicly available or easily discoverable, making such passwords vulnerable to guessing by attackers."
What is the most popular password listed in the document and how many users use it?,"The most popular password listed in the document is ""123456,"" which is used by 290,731 users according to the ""Password Popularity – Top 20"" table."
What constitutes a strong password?,"A strong password is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. It typically incorporates various character types, such as numbers, letters, and symbols, and avoids easily predictable patterns or personal information."
"Describe ""lengthy combinations"" as a characteristic of strong passwords.","""Lengthy combinations"" refer to long passwords that incorporate various character types, including numbers, letters, and symbols. An example provided is ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99,"" which demonstrates a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to increase complexity and difficulty in guessing."
"Explain the ""mnemonic"" approach to creating strong passwords.","The ""mnemonic"" approach to creating strong passwords involves generating passwords inspired by events only notable to the user. This often takes the form of a string of the first letters of a meaningful sentence that is easy for the user to remember but difficult for others to guess."
"What are ""non-dictionary words"" in the context of strong passwords, and how do they differ from dictionary words?","""Non-dictionary words"" are combinations of characters that are not formal or slang words found in dictionaries. They differ from ""dictionary words,"" which are publicly known combinations of characters. Dictionary words are stored in databases that cybercriminals access using software to input thousands of passwords per second, making them weak, whereas non-dictionary words are much harder to guess or crack."
What are the requirements for a strong authentication system regarding password changes?,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Additionally, the new passwords must be different from any previously used ones to prevent reuse of compromised or easily guessable passwords."
What are the different types of physical possessions used for authentication?,"The different types of physical possessions used for authentication include Tokens and Smartcards. Tokens are physical devices that generate codes, while Smartcards are physical cards that require a smart card reader for authentication."
What is a smartcard in the context of authentication?,"A smartcard in the context of authentication is a physical card that is used in conjunction with a smart card reader. It serves as a possession-based authentication factor, verifying a user's identity by something they have."
What are the limitations of using physical belongings for authentication?,"The limitations of using physical belongings for authentication include: they are easy to get lost; they can be high cost (e.g., $15-$25 for banks with millions of customers); they are possible to get damaged (e.g., a card in the washing machine or battery death); and they may rely on non-standard algorithms."
What is two-factor authentication?,"Two-factor authentication is a security measure that combines a user's knowledge (something they know, like a password) with physical belongings (something they have, like a token or smartcard). This combination makes it safer than relying on a single factor for authentication."
Why is it safer to combine users' knowledge with physical belongings for authentication?,"It is safer to combine users' knowledge with physical belongings for authentication because physical belongings are easy to get lost. By requiring both something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a token), the authentication process becomes more robust, as an attacker would need to compromise both factors."
What are biometrics?,Biometrics are physical characteristics that are measured for authentication purposes. They are used to verify a person's identity based on unique biological or behavioral traits.
Provide examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication.,"Examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication include fingerprints, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice recognition. These are physical traits that can be measured to identify an individual."
What are the advantages of using biometrics for authentication?,The advantages of using biometrics for authentication are that they can be extremely accurate and fast. This allows for quick and reliable verification of a user's identity based on their unique physical characteristics.
What are the limitations of biometrics?,"The limitations of biometrics are that they are private but not secret, meaning they can potentially be encoded on everyday objects like glass or a door handle. Additionally, revocation is difficult; if a biometric, such as an iris, is compromised, it is problematic to ""create a new one"" unlike changing a password."
Explain why biometrics are considered private but not secret.,"Biometrics are considered private but not secret because while they are unique to an individual, traces of them can be left behind or captured in the environment. For instance, a fingerprint might be encoded on a glass or a door handle, making it potentially accessible to others, even if the biometric itself is inherently personal."
What is authorization?,"Authorization is the process of implementing a security policy that specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and the type of access that is permitted in each instance. It mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources."
What is access control in the context of authorization?,"Access control is the mechanism that implements a security policy. This policy defines who or what is allowed to access specific resources within a computer system and determines the exact type of access permitted in each case. It acts as an intermediary between users (or processes acting for users) and system resources like applications, network sockets, and firewalls."
What are the three basic elements in a security policy?,The three basic elements in a security policy are: \n1.  **Subject**: This refers to the process or users attempting to access a resource.\n2.  **Object**: This is the resource that is security-sensitive and being accessed.\n3.  **Operations**: These are the specific actions taken using that resource.
"Define ""Subject"" in a security policy.","In a security policy, a **Subject** refers to the process or users that are attempting to access a resource. A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within the system."
"Define ""Object"" in a security policy.","In a security policy, an **Object** is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples include records, files, directories, memory, and databases."
"Define ""Operations"" in a security policy.","In a security policy, **Operations** refer to the specific actions taken using a particular resource. These actions are governed by the security policy, which dictates what a subject is permitted to do with an object."
"What is a subject in the context of authorization, and what is its accountability?","In the context of authorization, a subject is typically a process or a user. A subject is held accountable for the actions they have initiated within the computer system, meaning they are responsible for the operations performed on resources."
What are the three types of subjects in an authorization system?,"The three types of subjects in an authorization system are: \n1.  **Owner**: The creator of a resource, or a system administrator for system resources.\n2.  **Group**: A collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned.\n3.  **Other**: Users who can access the system but are not categorized as owner or group for a specific resource."
"Define ""Owner"" as a type of subject.","As a type of subject, an **Owner** may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. The owner typically has the highest level of control and privileges over the resource."
"Define ""Group"" as a type of subject and explain its implications for privileges.","As a type of subject, a **Group** is a collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned. A user joining the group will automatically receive the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose those permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups, and the concept of groups simplifies the management and updating of permissions for multiple users."
"Define ""Other"" as a type of subject.","As a type of subject, **Other** refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access to the resource."
How does belonging to a group affect a user's privileges?,"Belonging to a group affects a user's privileges by automatically granting them the corresponding privileges assigned to that group. Conversely, if a user quits the group, they will lose those permissions. This mechanism simplifies privilege management, especially when a user may belong to multiple groups."
"What is an object in the context of authorization, and what is its function?",An object in the context of authorization is a resource to which access is controlled. Its function is to be an entity used to contain and/or receive information within a computer system.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system that are subject to access control.,"Examples of objects in a computer system that are subject to access control include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, memory, hard disks, printers, databases, and applications."
"What are ""files"" in the context of objects in a computer system?","In the context of objects in a computer system, ""files"" are resources to which access is controlled. They are entities used to contain and/or receive information, and access control mechanisms determine who or what can interact with them and in what manner."
List the top 3 most popular weak passwords according to the provided table.,"According to the ""Password Popularity – Top 20"" table, the top 3 most popular weak passwords are: \n1.  ""123456"" (290,731 users)\n2.  ""12345"" (79,078 users)\n3.  ""123456789"" (76,790 users)"
"How many users use ""Password"" as their password, and what is its rank?","The password ""Password"" is used by 61,958 users and is ranked 4th in popularity according to the ""Password Popularity – Top 20"" table."
"What is the rank and number of users for the password ""Qwerty""?","The password ""Qwerty"" is ranked 20th in popularity and is used by 13,856 users, according to the ""Password Popularity – Top 20"" table."
What is the definition of a short password in the context of weak passwords?,"In the context of weak passwords, a short password is defined as a single word (e.g., ""password"") or a numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345""). These are considered weak because they are easy for others to guess or for password-hacking software to crack."
What is the difference in security between a weak password and a complex password?,"The difference in security between a weak password and a complex password lies in their susceptibility to being guessed. A weak password is easy to guess, making it insecure, while a complex password is strong and difficult to guess, providing higher security. This is part of the trade-off between security and convenience."
What are the cost implications of using physical belongings for authentication?,"The cost implications of using physical belongings for authentication can be high. For example, the document states costs of $15-$25, which can become substantial for organizations like banks with millions of customers, as each customer would require a physical token or smartcard."
How can physical belongings used for authentication get damaged?,"Physical belongings used for authentication can get damaged in various ways, such as a smartcard being put in a washing machine or a token experiencing battery death. Such damage can render the authentication device unusable, preventing access."
"What is a ""network socket"" in the context of system resources for authorization?","A ""network socket"" is an example of a system resource that is an object in the context of authorization. It is an endpoint of a communication flow across a computer network, and access control mediates who or what (e.g., a user or process) can interact with it."
What role do firewalls play in access control mediation?,"Firewalls are examples of system resources that access control mediates. Access control determines how a user or a process executing on behalf of a user can interact with these resources, ensuring that the security policy is enforced regarding network traffic."
"What is the significance of ""unique characters"" in a strong password?","The significance of ""unique characters"" in a strong password is that they contribute to making the password a long combination that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. Incorporating a variety of character types, such as numbers, letters, and symbols, increases its complexity and strength."
How do cybercriminals typically access dictionary words for password cracking?,"Cybercriminals typically access dictionary words for password cracking by utilizing software that inputs thousands of publicly known combinations of characters, which are stored in a database, per second. This method allows them to rapidly test common words against user accounts."
"What is the primary difference between ""Something You Know"" (password) and ""Something You Have"" (physical belongings) for authentication?","The primary difference is that ""Something You Know"" refers to knowledge-based authentication, like a password, which is a secret character combination. ""Something You Have"" refers to possession-based authentication, involving physical items like tokens or smartcards. Both are factors used to prove identity, but they rely on different types of credentials."
"What is the primary difference between ""Something You Know"" (password) and ""Something You Are"" (biometrics) for authentication?","The primary difference is that ""Something You Know"" (password) relies on a secret character combination that a user remembers. ""Something You Are"" (biometrics) relies on measuring a unique physical characteristic of the user, such as a fingerprint or face recognition. Passwords can be changed, while biometrics are generally fixed and difficult to revoke if compromised."
