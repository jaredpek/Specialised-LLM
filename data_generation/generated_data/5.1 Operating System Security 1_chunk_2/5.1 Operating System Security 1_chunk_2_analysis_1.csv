"Analyze the concept of password-based authentication, including its security implications and trade-offs.","Password is the most common way to prove who you are, adopted by various networking websites and applications. The security of the password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password, which refers to the chance an attacker can guess the password. There is a fundamental trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password, while easy to memorize, is also easy to be guessed, compromising security. Conversely, a complex password, which offers strong security, often results in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and input."
What insights can be derived from the analysis of weak passwords?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Insights into weak passwords reveal several common characteristics: they are often short passwords, such as a single word (e.g., ""password"") or a numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345""). They frequently include recognizable keystroke patterns, like ""QWERTY"" found on a keyboard. Many weak passwords also incorporate personal information, such as a date of birth, address, or name. Additionally, repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"") are common traits of weak passwords. The ""Password Popularity – Top 20"" list further illustrates this by showing passwords like ""123456"", ""password"", ""iloveyou"", and ""qwerty"" are used by a significant number of users, making them highly vulnerable."
Describe the attributes that define a strong password and the requirements for a robust authentication system.,"A strong password is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. Its attributes include: Lengthy combinations, which are long passwords incorporating various character types such as numbers, letters, and symbols (ee.g., N0r+Hc^R0|in^99). Mnemonic passwords, which are created by inspiring events only notable to the user, often formed as a string of first letters of a meaningful sentence. Non-dictionary words, which are not formal or slang words publicly known and stored in databases that cybercriminals access using software to input thousands of passwords per second. A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months, and mandates that the new passwords must be different from the previously used ones."
"Explain the concept of 'Something You Have' as an authentication factor, including its types and limitations.","'Something You Have' refers to different types of physical possessions used for authentication. The primary types include Tokens and Smartcards. Tokens are typically small hardware devices that generate codes or respond to challenges for authentication. Smartcards are physical cards that require a smart card reader to function, often containing a microchip for secure data storage and processing. \n\nDespite their utility, physical belongings have several limitations: they are easy to get lost, which can compromise security if not combined with other factors. They can incur high costs, for example, $15-$25 per token for banks with millions of customers. They are susceptible to damage, such as a card being ruined in a washing machine or experiencing battery death. Lastly, they may rely on non-standard algorithms, which can complicate integration and interoperability."
"Analyze biometrics as an authentication method, detailing its characteristics and inherent limitations.","Biometrics measure some physical characteristic of an individual to prove identity. Examples of biometric characteristics include fingerprints, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice patterns. Biometric authentication can be extremely accurate and fast, offering a convenient and precise method of verification. \n\nHowever, biometrics also come with significant limitations. They are private but not secret; for instance, a fingerprint might be inadvertently encoded on a glass surface or a door handle, making it potentially accessible to others. Another major limitation is the difficulty of revocation. Unlike a password that can be easily changed if compromised, if a biometric identifier like an iris is compromised, it is difficult to 'create a new one' for the user."
Define access control and its role within a computer system's security framework.,"Access control is a security mechanism that implements a security policy. A security policy specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system, and the type of access that is permitted in each instance. Access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources. System resources include various components like applications, network sockets, and firewalls, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with them in defined ways."
What are the three basic elements that constitute a security policy?,"The three basic elements in a security policy are: \n\n1.  **Subject**: This refers to the process or users attempting to access a resource. A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. \n2.  **Object**: This is the resource that is security-sensitive and to which access is controlled. An object is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. \n3.  **Operations**: These are the specific actions that can be taken using that resource. Examples of operations might include reading, writing, or executing a file."
"Elaborate on the concept of a 'Subject' in the context of a security policy, including its types.","A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a computer system. In the context of a security policy, there can be three types of subjects: \n\n1.  **Owner**: This may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. The owner typically has the highest level of control over the resource. \n2.  **Group**: In addition to individual users, privileges can also be assigned to a group of users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions for multiple users simultaneously. \n3.  **Other**: This category refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. They are typically granted the least amount of access."
Define an 'Object' within a security policy and provide examples of what it encompasses.,"An object is a resource to which access is controlled within a security policy. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples of objects include: records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs. Other examples of objects in computer systems include network sockets, hard disks, printers, applications (Apps), memory, and databases."
How does the strength of a password relate to the security of an authentication mechanism?,"The security of the password-based authentication mechanism directly depends on the strength of the selected password. A stronger password reduces the chance an attacker can guess the password, thereby increasing the overall security of the authentication process. Conversely, a weak password is easy to be guessed, making the authentication mechanism vulnerable."
Discuss the trade-off between password security and user convenience.,"There is a significant trade-off between password security and user convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize, which enhances user convenience, but it is also easy to be guessed by attackers, compromising security. On the other hand, a complex password is strong and difficult for attackers to guess, providing high security, but it often results in frustrated users because it is hard to remember and type correctly."
Identify and describe the characteristics of short passwords that make them weak.,"Short passwords are a characteristic of weak passwords because they are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These typically include a single word (e.g., ""password"") or a simple numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345""). Their brevity and simplicity make them highly susceptible to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks, where common words and number sequences are quickly tested."
Explain how recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords.,"Recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords because they are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These patterns are sequences of characters that are physically close on a keyboard, such as ""QWERTY"", which is the first row of letters on a standard English keyboard. Attackers can easily predict and test such common patterns, making passwords based on them highly vulnerable."
How does the use of personal information in passwords compromise their strength?,"The use of personal information in passwords compromises their strength because such passwords are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Personal information includes details like date of birth, address, or name. This information is often publicly available or easily discoverable through social engineering, allowing attackers to quickly deduce potential passwords and gain unauthorized access."
What role do repeated letters or numbers play in making a password weak?,"Repeated letters or numbers play a significant role in making a password weak because they are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Examples include sequences like ""55555"" or ""aaaa"". The predictability and lack of complexity in such repetitions make them highly vulnerable to simple guessing attempts and automated attacks, as they offer very little entropy."
"Based on the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table, identify the top 3 most common weak passwords and their user counts.","Based on the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table, the top 3 most common weak passwords and their absolute user counts are: \n\n1.  **123456**: Used by 290,731 users. \n2.  **12345**: Used by 79,078 users. \n3.  **123456789**: Used by 76,790 users."
Discuss the characteristics of lengthy combination passwords that make them strong.,"Lengthy combination passwords are a characteristic of strong passwords because they are difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. These passwords are long and incorporate various character types, such as numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols. An example provided is ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99"". The combination of length and diverse character types significantly increases the number of possible permutations, making them highly resistant to brute-force attacks."
Explain the concept of mnemonic passwords and how they contribute to password strength.,"Mnemonic passwords are a type of strong password created by inspiring events only notable to the user. They are typically formed as a string of first letters of a meaningful sentence or phrase that is easy for the user to remember but difficult for others to guess. For example, the first letters of ""My dog has fleas and I love him very much!"" could form a mnemonic password. This method contributes to password strength by allowing users to create long and complex passwords that are unique to their personal experience, making them resistant to dictionary attacks and general guessing."
"How do non-dictionary words enhance password strength, and what is the risk associated with dictionary words?","Non-dictionary words enhance password strength because they are difficult for other people to guess or technology to crack. Dictionary words, whether formal or slang, are publicly known combinations of characters stored in databases that cybercriminals access. Cybercriminals use software to input thousands of these dictionary passwords per second in automated attacks. By using non-dictionary words, passwords avoid these readily available lists, significantly increasing the effort and time required for an attacker to guess them."
What are the requirements for a strong authentication system concerning password management?,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Furthermore, it mandates that the new passwords must be different from the used ones. These requirements ensure that even if a password is compromised, its utility to an attacker is limited in time, and users are prevented from simply recycling old, potentially compromised passwords."
Differentiate between Tokens and Smartcards as types of physical possessions for authentication.,"Tokens and Smartcards are both types of physical possessions used for authentication, falling under the 'Something You Have' category. \n\n**Tokens** are typically small hardware devices that generate one-time passcodes or respond to challenges to verify a user's identity. \n\n**Smartcards** are physical cards that contain an embedded microchip and require a smart card reader to function. The smart card reader interacts with the card to perform authentication, often involving cryptographic operations. While both provide a physical factor, smartcards typically offer more advanced processing and storage capabilities compared to simpler tokens."
Define two-factor authentication and explain why it is considered safer.,"Two-factor authentication is a security measure that combines a user's knowledge (something they know, like a password) with physical belongings (something they have) to prove identity. It is considered safer because physical belongings, such as tokens or smartcards, can be easy to get lost. By requiring both factors, even if one factor (like a password) is compromised or one's physical belonging is lost, the authentication remains secure because an attacker would need both to gain access."
"Discuss the financial implications of using physical belongings for authentication, particularly for large organizations.","The financial implications of using physical belongings for authentication can be significant, especially for large organizations. These physical items, such as tokens or smartcards, can incur a high cost. For example, the document states a cost of $15-$25 per item. For banks with millions of customers, deploying and maintaining such a system would result in substantial expenses, making it a costly authentication method."
How can physical damage impact the effectiveness of physical belongings as an authentication method?,"Physical damage can significantly impact the effectiveness of physical belongings as an authentication method. These items are susceptible to various forms of damage, such as a smartcard being ruined in a washing machine or a token experiencing battery death. When a physical belonging is damaged, it becomes unusable for authentication, rendering the user unable to access systems and potentially requiring costly replacement and re-provisioning."
What is the concern regarding non-standard algorithms in the context of physical belongings for authentication?,"The concern regarding non-standard algorithms in the context of physical belongings for authentication is that they can introduce complexities and potential vulnerabilities. Non-standard algorithms may lack the rigorous public scrutiny and widespread testing that standard algorithms receive, potentially leading to undiscovered flaws or difficulties in interoperability and integration with diverse systems. This can make the authentication system less robust and harder to maintain."
What are the key advantages of using biometrics for authentication?,"The key advantages of using biometrics for authentication are their extreme accuracy and speed. Biometrics measure unique physical characteristics such as fingerprints, face recognition, retina scanners, or voice patterns. This inherent uniqueness allows for a very precise identification of an individual, leading to high accuracy. The process of capturing and verifying these characteristics can also be very fast, offering a quick and efficient authentication experience for users."
Explain why biometrics are considered 'private but not secret' and its implications.,"Biometrics are considered 'private but not secret' because, while they are unique to an individual, they can be inadvertently left behind or captured without the individual's direct consent or knowledge. For example, a fingerprint might be encoded on a glass surface or a door handle. The implication is that unlike a password, which is secret and known only to the user, biometric data can be acquired from the environment, potentially allowing for unauthorized replication or use if not properly secured."
"Why is revocation difficult for biometric authentication, and what are the consequences?","Revocation is difficult for biometric authentication because biometric identifiers are inherent physical characteristics of an individual and cannot be easily changed or replaced. For example, if an iris scan is compromised, a user cannot simply 'create a new one' like they would a password. The consequence is that once a biometric identifier is compromised, it may be permanently unusable for secure authentication, potentially forcing the user to rely on alternative, less convenient, or less secure methods."
What is the primary function of access control in mediating interactions within a computer system?,"The primary function of access control in mediating interactions within a computer system is to act as an intermediary between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources. It ensures that only authorized subjects can perform permitted operations on specific objects, thereby enforcing the defined security policy. This mediation prevents unauthorized access to critical resources such as applications, network sockets, and firewalls."
Define a 'security policy' in the context of access control.,"A security policy, in the context of access control, is a set of rules or guidelines that specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system. It also dictates the type of access that is permitted in each instance. The access control mechanism is responsible for implementing this policy, ensuring that all interactions with system resources adhere to these defined rules."
Elaborate on the role of 'Operations' as a basic element in a security policy.,"'Operations' are one of the three basic elements in a security policy, alongside Subject and Object. Operations refer to the specific actions that can be taken using a particular resource (object). For example, if the object is a file, operations might include reading, writing, executing, or deleting it. The security policy defines which subjects are permitted to perform which operations on which objects, thereby controlling how resources are utilized."
Describe the 'Owner' type of subject and their typical role in resource management.,"The 'Owner' is one of the three types of subjects in a security policy. An owner may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. The owner typically has comprehensive control over the resource, including the ability to define permissions for other subjects, manage the resource's attributes, and often delegate ownership or modify access rights."
Explain the 'Group' type of subject and the advantages of using groups for managing permissions.,"The 'Group' is a type of subject where privileges are assigned to a collection of users rather than individual users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups. The concept of groups makes it significantly easier to manage and update permissions because changes applied to the group automatically propagate to all its members, streamlining administrative tasks and ensuring consistent access control."
"Who falls under the 'Other' category of subjects, and what level of access are they typically granted?","The 'Other' category of subjects refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access. This minimal access ensures that individuals without a direct relationship (as owner or group member) to a resource still have some interaction capability, but with the highest level of restriction to maintain security."
"Provide a comprehensive list of examples for 'Objects' in a computer system, as illustrated in the document.","Objects in a computer system are resources to which access is controlled, and they are entities used to contain and/or receive information. Examples include: records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs. Additionally, specific examples illustrated in the document include Network sockets, Hard disks, Printers, Applications (Apps), Memory, and Databases."
How does the Nanyang Technological University login page exemplify password-based authentication?,"The Nanyang Technological University login page exemplifies password-based authentication by requiring users to input a username (e.g., username@staff.main.ntu.edu.sg) and a password to sign in. This interface demonstrates the common practice of using 'something you know'—the password—as the primary credential to prove identity and gain access to organizational accounts or network services."
What is the significance of the 'Number of Users with Password (absolute)' column in the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table?,"The 'Number of Users with Password (absolute)' column in the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table signifies the sheer volume of users who employ these specific weak passwords. This metric highlights the widespread adoption of easily guessable passwords, underscoring the vulnerability of many accounts. A high number in this column indicates that these passwords are not only weak in their composition but also commonly used, making them prime targets for attackers."
Identify the least popular password from the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table and its user count.,"Based on the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table, the least popular password listed is ""Qwerty"", with 13,856 users. This indicates that while still a common weak password, it is used by fewer individuals compared to others in the top 20 list."
What specific character types are recommended for lengthy combination passwords to ensure strength?,"For lengthy combination passwords to ensure strength, specific character types recommended include numbers, letters (implying both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols. The combination of these diverse character types significantly increases the complexity and unpredictability of the password, making it much harder for attackers to guess or crack through automated means."
Why is it important for new passwords to be different from used ones in a strong authentication system?,"It is important for new passwords to be different from used ones in a strong authentication system to prevent attackers from reusing previously compromised or easily guessable passwords. If users could simply revert to old passwords, any past breach or successful guessing attempt would remain a persistent vulnerability, undermining the security benefits of periodic password changes."
How do tokens and smartcards represent the 'Something You Have' authentication factor?,"Tokens and smartcards represent the 'Something You Have' authentication factor because they are physical objects that a user possesses and must present to authenticate. Tokens are typically small devices that generate one-time codes, while smartcards are physical cards with embedded chips that interact with a reader. In both cases, the physical presence and control of these items are essential for proving identity, distinguishing them from 'something you know' (like a password) or 'something you are' (like a biometric."
What is the primary risk associated with physical belongings being easy to get lost in an authentication context?,"The primary risk associated with physical belongings being easy to get lost in an authentication context is that if the lost item is the sole factor for authentication, it could lead to unauthorized access. The document explicitly states that because physical belongings are easy to get lost, it is safer to combine users' knowledge with physical belongings, which is referred to as two-factor authentication, to mitigate this risk."
List the various physical characteristics measured by biometrics for authentication.,"Biometrics measure several physical characteristics for authentication. These include fingerprints, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice patterns. Each of these characteristics is unique to an individual and can be used to verify their identity."
How does access control mediate between users and system resources?,"Access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources by implementing a security policy. This mediation ensures that only authorized users or processes can interact with specific resources, such as applications, network sockets, or firewalls, and only in the ways permitted by the security policy. It acts as a gatekeeper, enforcing rules about who can do what to which resource."
What is the fundamental principle behind a 'Subject' being held accountable in a security policy?,"The fundamental principle behind a 'Subject' being held accountable in a security policy is that a subject, whether a process or a user, initiates actions within the system. By holding them accountable, the system can track and attribute all operations performed on resources to a specific entity. This accountability is crucial for maintaining security, auditing, and ensuring that unauthorized or malicious actions can be traced back to their source."
How does the concept of 'Group' simplify permission management for system administrators?,"The concept of 'Group' simplifies permission management for system administrators by allowing them to assign privileges to a collection of users rather than managing permissions for each individual user separately. When a user joins a group, they automatically inherit the corresponding privileges, and when they leave, they lose them. This streamlines the process of granting or revoking access, especially in environments with many users and resources, as administrators only need to modify group permissions rather than individual user permissions."
What types of information can an 'Object' contain or receive in a computer system?,"An 'Object' in a computer system is a resource to which access is controlled, and it is defined as an entity used to contain and/or receive information. This information can be diverse, including data within records, blocks, pages, segments, files, or portions of files. Objects can also contain or receive information in the form of directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs."
"Analyze the security implications of using '123456' as a password, given its popularity.","Using '123456' as a password carries severe security implications primarily because it is the most popular weak password listed, with 290,731 users. Its simplicity and sequential nature make it extremely easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Attackers can quickly crack such a password using brute-force or dictionary attacks, leading to a high risk of unauthorized access and compromise of user accounts."
How do 'N0r+Hc^R0|in^99' and similar lengthy combinations exemplify strong password characteristics?,"'N0r+Hc^R0|in^99' and similar lengthy combinations exemplify strong password characteristics by being long and incorporating a variety of character types: numbers (0, 99), letters (N, r, H, c, R, in), and symbols (+, ^, |). This diversity and length significantly increase the complexity of the password, making it extremely difficult for other people to guess or for technology to crack through automated attacks, thereby enhancing security."
What is the primary purpose of requiring periodic password changes in a strong authentication system?,"The primary purpose of requiring periodic password changes in a strong authentication system is to limit the window of vulnerability for any given password. Even if a password is strong, it could eventually be compromised through various means. By forcing regular changes (e.g., every six months), the system ensures that a potentially compromised password has a limited lifespan, reducing the time an attacker can exploit it and mitigating the risk of long-term unauthorized access."
Explain the role of a 'smart card reader' in the authentication process involving smartcards.,"A 'smart card reader' plays a crucial role in the authentication process involving smartcards. A smartcard is a physical card with an embedded microchip, and it requires a smart card reader to function. The reader provides the interface for the computer system to communicate with the smartcard, allowing it to access the card's secure data and perform cryptographic operations necessary for authentication. Without the reader, the smartcard cannot be utilized for verification."
How does the 'high cost' limitation of physical belongings impact their widespread adoption for authentication?,"The 'high cost' limitation of physical belongings, such as tokens or smartcards (e.g., $15-$25 per item), significantly impacts their widespread adoption for authentication, especially for large organizations. For entities like banks with millions of customers, these costs can quickly escalate into substantial investments. This financial burden can deter organizations from implementing or scaling physical belonging-based authentication solutions, favoring less expensive alternatives despite potential security trade-offs."
What are the implications of biometrics being 'extremely accurate and fast' for user experience and security?,"The implications of biometrics being 'extremely accurate and fast' are significant for both user experience and security. For user experience, it means quick and seamless authentication, reducing friction and wait times. For security, high accuracy minimizes false positives (incorrectly authenticating an unauthorized user) and false negatives (incorrectly denying an authorized user), leading to a more reliable and robust security system. The speed also makes it practical for frequent authentication needs."
How does a security policy define the type of access permitted to a specific resource?,"A security policy defines the type of access permitted to a specific resource by explicitly specifying which operations (actions) a subject (user or process) may perform on an object (resource) in each instance. For example, it might state that a particular user can only 'read' a specific file but not 'write' to it, or that a certain process can 'execute' an application but not 'modify' its core files. This granular control ensures that interactions with resources adhere to predefined security rules."
"In the context of a security policy, what is the relationship between a 'Subject' and 'Operations'?","In the context of a security policy, the relationship between a 'Subject' and 'Operations' is that the Subject (a process or user) is the entity that initiates or attempts to perform the Operations (actions) on a resource. The security policy dictates which specific operations a given subject is authorized to execute on a particular object. The subject is held accountable for the operations it initiates."
How do 'Network sockets' function as 'Objects' in a computer system?,"Network sockets function as 'Objects' in a computer system by serving as endpoints for communication across a network. As objects, they are resources to which access is controlled. A security policy would define which subjects (e.g., specific applications or users) are permitted to perform operations on these sockets, such as opening a connection, sending data, or receiving data, thereby regulating network communication and preventing unauthorized access or data exfiltration."
Explain how 'Hard disks' are considered 'Objects' in a computer system.,"'Hard disks' are considered 'Objects' in a computer system because they are resources that contain and receive information, and to which access is controlled. They store vast amounts of data, including files, programs, and operating system components. A security policy would specify which subjects (users or processes) are authorized to perform operations on the hard disk, such as reading from or writing to specific sectors, files, or directories, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality."
In what way do 'Printers' serve as 'Objects' within a computer system's security framework?,"'Printers' serve as 'Objects' within a computer system's security framework because they are resources that receive information (print jobs) and to which access must be controlled. A security policy would define which subjects (users or applications) are authorized to perform operations like sending documents to the printer, managing print queues, or configuring printer settings. This control prevents unauthorized printing, ensures resource availability, and can manage sensitive document handling."
How are 'Applications (Apps)' categorized as 'Objects' in a computer system?,"'Applications (Apps)' are categorized as 'Objects' in a computer system because they are resources that contain and process information, and their execution and access to their data must be controlled. A security policy specifies which subjects (users or other processes) are authorized to perform operations on these applications, such as launching them, accessing their configuration files, or interacting with their data. This ensures that only authorized entities can use or modify software, protecting system integrity and data."
Describe the role of 'Memory' as an 'Object' in a computer system.,"'Memory' plays a critical role as an 'Object' in a computer system because it is a resource that contains and receives information (data and instructions) that is actively being used by the CPU. Access to memory must be strictly controlled. A security policy defines which subjects (processes) are authorized to perform operations like reading from or writing to specific memory segments or pages. This control is essential for preventing unauthorized data access, buffer overflows, and other memory-based attacks that could compromise system stability and security."
In what capacity do 'Databases' function as 'Objects' in a computer system?,"'Databases' function as 'Objects' in a computer system as they are critical resources designed to contain and receive structured information, and access to this information must be rigorously controlled. A security policy specifies which subjects (users or applications) are authorized to perform operations on a database, such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing entries, or deleting information. This ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, preventing unauthorized manipulation or disclosure of sensitive information."
