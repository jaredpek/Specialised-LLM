Define the concept of a password as described in the document.,A password is the most common way to prove who you are. It is adopted by various networking websites and applications as a mechanism for authentication.
What determines the security of a password-based authentication mechanism?,The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password. This strength is directly related to the chance an attacker can guess the password.
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize, which makes it convenient, but it is also easy to be guessed, compromising security. Conversely, a complex password is strong, offering better security, but it often results in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and input."
What are the characteristics of a weak password?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Characteristics include short passwords (e.g., a single word like ""password"" or a numerical phrase like ""12345""), recognizable keystroke patterns (e.g., ""QWERTY""), personal information (e.g., date of birth, address, name), and repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"")."
Provide examples of short passwords that are considered weak.,"Examples of short passwords considered weak include a single word such as ""password"" or a numerical phrase like ""12345""."
How do recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns, such as ""QWERTY"" which can be found by looking at a keyboard, contribute to weak passwords because they are predictable and easy for attackers to guess or crack."
In what ways can personal information lead to a weak password?,"Personal information can lead to a weak password when details like a user's date of birth, address, or name are used. These pieces of information are often publicly available or easily discoverable, making the password vulnerable to guessing."
Give examples of repeated letters or numbers that make a password weak.,"Examples of repeated letters or numbers that make a password weak include sequences like ""55555"" or ""aaaa"". Such patterns are simple and highly susceptible to being guessed."
"According to the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table, what is the most popular weak password and how many users use it?","According to the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table, the most popular weak password is ""123456"", used by 290,731 users."
List the top 5 most popular weak passwords from the provided table.,"The top 5 most popular weak passwords from the provided table are:\n1. 123456 (290,731 users)\n2. 12345 (79,078 users)\n3. 123456789 (76,790 users)\n4. Password (61,958 users)\n5. iloveyou (51,622 users)"
What is the 20th most popular weak password listed in the document?,"The 20th most popular weak password listed in the document is ""Qwerty"", used by 13,856 users."
Define a strong password.,"A strong password is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or for technology to crack. It typically incorporates various character types such as numbers, letters, and symbols."
Explain what 'lengthy combinations' mean in the context of strong passwords and provide an example.,"'Lengthy combinations' in the context of strong passwords refer to long passwords that include various character types, such as numbers, letters, and symbols. An example provided is ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99""."
Describe the 'Mnemonic' method for creating strong passwords.,The 'Mnemonic' method for creating strong passwords involves creating passwords inspired by events only notable to the user. This often means using a string of the first letters of a meaningful sentence that only the user would know.
What are 'Non-dictionary words' and why are they important for strong passwords?,"'Non-dictionary words' are combinations of characters that are not formal or slang dictionary words. Dictionary words are publicly known combinations of characters stored in databases that cybercriminals access using software to input thousands of passwords per second. By using non-dictionary words, passwords become significantly harder for such software to guess or crack."
What are the requirements for a strong authentication system regarding password management?,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Additionally, the new passwords must be different from any previously used ones."
How often should passwords be changed in a strong authentication system?,"In a strong authentication system, users are required to change their password periodically, such as every six months."
What are the different types of possessions used for authentication?,"The different types of possessions used for authentication include Tokens and Smartcards. Tokens are general physical objects, while Smartcards are physical cards combined with a smart card reader."
Define 'Tokens' as a type of possession for authentication.,"Tokens, in the context of authentication, refer to physical objects that a user possesses and uses to prove their identity."
Define 'Smartcards' as a type of possession for authentication.,"Smartcards, as a type of possession for authentication, consist of a physical card that works in conjunction with a smart card reader to verify a user's identity."
What are the limitations of using physical belongings for authentication?,"The limitations of using physical belongings for authentication include that they are easy to get lost, can be high cost (e.g., $15-$25 for banks with millions of customers), are possible to get damaged (e.g., a card in a washing machine or battery death), and may rely on non-standard algorithms."
Explain why physical belongings are easy to get lost and what solution is suggested.,"Physical belongings are easy to get lost, which poses a security risk. To mitigate this, it is suggested that it is safer to combine users' knowledge (like a password) with physical belongings. This combination is referred to as two-factor authentication."
Define 'two-factor authentication'.,"Two-factor authentication is a security process that combines a user's knowledge (something they know, like a password) with physical belongings (something they have, like a token or smartcard) to verify their identity, making it more secure than using just one factor."
What are the cost implications of using physical belongings for authentication?,"The cost implications of using physical belongings for authentication can be high. For example, the cost can range from $15 to $25, which can become substantial for large organizations like banks with millions of customers."
How can physical belongings used for authentication get damaged?,"Physical belongings used for authentication can get damaged in various ways, such as a card being put through a washing machine or a device experiencing battery death, rendering it unusable."
What do biometrics measure?,Biometrics measure some physical characteristic of an individual.
List examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication.,"Examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication include fingerprints, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice."
What are the advantages of using biometrics for authentication?,The advantages of using biometrics for authentication are that they can be extremely accurate and fast.
What are the limitations of biometrics?,"The limitations of biometrics include that they are private but not secret, meaning they could potentially be encoded on objects like a glass or door handle. Additionally, revocation is difficult; if a biometric characteristic like an iris is compromised, it is problematic to create a new one."
"Explain the statement 'Biometrics are private, but not secret.'","The statement 'Biometrics are private, but not secret' means that while biometric characteristics are unique to an individual, they are not inherently hidden. For example, a fingerprint could be left on a glass or a door handle, making it potentially accessible or reproducible by others, unlike a secret password."
Why is revocation difficult for biometrics?,"Revocation is difficult for biometrics because if a biometric characteristic, such as an iris, is compromised, it is not possible to simply 'create a new one' in the same way a password can be changed. This makes recovery from a biometric compromise significantly more challenging."
Define 'Authorization' in the context of computer systems.,"Authorization, in the context of computer systems, involves implementing an access control mechanism based on a security policy. This policy specifies who or what may have access to each specific resource and the type of access permitted in each instance."
What is 'Access control' and what is its function?,Access control is a mechanism that implements a security policy. Its function is to specify who or what may have access to each specific resource in a computer system and the type of access that is permitted in each instance. It mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources.
How does access control mediate between users and system resources?,"Access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and system resources by regulating interactions. System resources include applications, network sockets, and firewalls, and access control ensures that only authorized subjects can perform permitted operations on these objects."
List the three basic elements in a security policy.,"The three basic elements in a security policy are: Subject, Object, and Operations."
Define 'Subject' in the context of a security policy.,"In the context of a security policy, a Subject refers to a process or users. A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within the system."
Define 'Object' in the context of a security policy.,"In the context of a security policy, an Object refers to a resource that is security-sensitive. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information, and access to it is controlled."
Define 'Operations' in the context of a security policy.,"In the context of a security policy, Operations refer to the actions taken using a specific resource (object). These actions are governed by the security policy to ensure authorized use."
Provide a detailed definition of a 'Subject' and its accountability.,"A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a computer system. Subjects can be processes or users. There are three types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other, each with different levels of access and responsibilities."
What are the three types of subjects in a security policy?,"The three types of subjects in a security policy are Owner, Group, and Other."
Define 'Owner' as a type of subject.,"An Owner, as a type of subject, may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. The owner typically has the highest level of control and privileges over the resource."
Define 'Group' as a type of subject and explain its implications for privileges.,"A Group, as a type of subject, allows privileges to be assigned to a collection of users in addition to individual users. When a user joins a group, they automatically gain the corresponding privileges. Conversely, a user quitting the group will lose those permissions. Users may belong to multiple groups, and the concept of groups simplifies the management and updating of permissions."
Define 'Other' as a type of subject.,"Other, as a type of subject, refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner or group for a specific resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access."
How does group membership affect user privileges?,"Group membership directly affects user privileges: a user joining a group will automatically have the corresponding privileges assigned to that group, while a user quitting the group will lose those permissions. This mechanism simplifies privilege management."
What is the benefit of using groups for managing permissions?,"The benefit of using groups for managing permissions is that it makes it easier to manage and update permissions. Instead of assigning privileges to individual users, they can be assigned to a group, and all members of that group automatically inherit those privileges."
Provide a detailed definition of an 'Object' in access control.,"An object, in the context of access control, is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, applications (Apps), memory, databases, hard disks, and printers."
What is an object used for in a computer system?,"In a computer system, an object is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Access to these objects is controlled by a security policy."
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects in a computer system include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs. More broadly, they encompass resources like network sockets, applications (Apps), memory, databases, hard disks, and printers."
List the different types of computer system resources that can be considered objects.,"The different types of computer system resources that can be considered objects include network sockets, applications (Apps), memory, databases, hard disks, and printers."
What is the primary characteristic of a resource that makes it an 'Object' in a security policy?,The primary characteristic of a resource that makes it an 'Object' in a security policy is that it is security-sensitive and its access is controlled. It is an entity that contains or receives information.
How does the document define 'password strength'?,The document defines 'password strength' as the measure of how difficult it is for an attacker to guess the password. The security of a password-based authentication mechanism directly depends on this strength.
