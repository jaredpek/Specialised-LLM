Define what a password is and its primary function in authentication.,A password is the most common way to prove who you are. It is widely adopted by various networking websites and applications to verify a user's identity during an authentication mechanism.
Explain how the security of a password-based authentication mechanism is determined.,"The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password. This strength is directly related to the chance an attacker can guess the password. A stronger password reduces the likelihood of it being guessed, thereby enhancing security."
Describe the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a significant trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize, which offers convenience, but it is also easy for attackers to guess, compromising security. Conversely, a complex password is strong and difficult to guess, providing high security, but it often results in frustrated users due to its difficulty in memorization and input."
What is considered a 'weak password'?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These passwords lack complexity and predictability, making them vulnerable to various guessing techniques."
List the common characteristics that make a password weak.,"Common characteristics that make a password weak include: \n1. **Short passwords**: These are typically a single word (e.g., ""password"") or a simple numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345""). \n2. **Recognizable keystroke patterns**: Passwords formed by easily identifiable patterns on a keyboard, such as ""QWERTY"". \n3. **Personal information**: Using personal details like date of birth, address, or name within the password. \n4. **Repeated letters or numbers**: Passwords consisting of sequences of the same character, such as ""55555"" or ""aaaa""."
Provide examples of weak passwords from the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' list.,"Examples of weak passwords from the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' list include ""123456"", ""12345"", ""password"", ""iloveyou"", ""princess"", ""rockyou"", ""abc123"", ""nicole"", ""daniel"", ""babygirl"", ""monkey"", ""jessica"", ""lovely"", ""michael"", ""ashley"", and ""qwerty""."
Define what constitutes a 'strong password'.,A strong password is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or for technology to crack. It incorporates various character types and is not easily predictable.
What are the key characteristics of a strong password?,"The key characteristics of a strong password are: \n1. **Lengthy combinations**: These are long passwords that incorporate various character types, such as numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols (e.g., ""N0r+Hc^R0|in^99""). \n2. **Mnemonic**: Passwords created using a mnemonic technique, inspired by events only notable to the user, such as a string of first letters from a meaningful sentence. \n3. **Non-dictionary words**: Passwords that do not consist of dictionary words, which include formal or slang terms that are publicly known combinations of characters stored in databases accessed by cybercriminals using software to input thousands of passwords per second."
What is a mnemonic password and how is it created?,"A mnemonic password is a type of strong password created by drawing inspiration from events or information only notable to the user. Typically, it involves taking a string of the first letters from a meaningful sentence or phrase that the user can easily recall, but which would be obscure to others."
Explain the concept of 'non-dictionary words' in the context of strong passwords.,"In the context of strong passwords, 'non-dictionary words' refers to character combinations that are not formal or slang words. These words are publicly known combinations of characters that are often stored in databases. Cybercriminals frequently access these databases and use software to input thousands of such passwords per second in attempts to crack accounts. By avoiding dictionary words, a password becomes significantly harder to guess or crack."
What are the requirements for a strong authentication system regarding password management?,"A strong authentication system requires users to change their password periodically, for example, every six months. Additionally, the new passwords must be different from any previously used ones to prevent reuse of compromised or easily guessable passwords."
What are 'tokens' in the context of authentication?,"Tokens, in the context of authentication, are a type of physical possession used to prove identity. They are one of the different types of physical belongings that can be utilized for authentication purposes."
Describe smartcards as a method of authentication.,Smartcards are a method of authentication that involves a physical card combined with a smart card reader. This combination serves as a possession-based factor to verify a user's identity.
What are the main limitations associated with using physical belongings for authentication?,"The main limitations associated with using physical belongings for authentication include: \n1. **Easy to get lost**: Physical items can be misplaced, making authentication impossible. \n2. **High cost**: Implementing and distributing physical belongings can be expensive, especially for large organizations (e.g., $15-$25 per item for banks with millions of customers). \n3. **Possible to get damaged**: Physical items can be damaged (e.g., a card in a washing machine, battery death for electronic tokens), rendering them unusable. \n4. **Non-standard algorithms**: Some physical belongings may rely on non-standard algorithms, which could pose interoperability or security concerns."
What is two-factor authentication in relation to physical belongings?,"Two-factor authentication, in relation to physical belongings, is a security measure where it is considered safer to combine a user's knowledge (something they know, like a password) with their physical belongings (something they have, like a token or smartcard). This approach enhances security by requiring two distinct types of evidence for identity verification."
Define biometrics in the context of authentication.,"Biometrics, in the context of authentication, refers to the measurement of some physical characteristic of an individual. These unique physical traits are used to verify identity."
Provide examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication.,"Examples of biometric characteristics used for authentication include fingerprints, face recognition, retina scanners, and voice recognition. These are unique physical attributes measured to verify an individual's identity."
What are the advantages of using biometrics for authentication?,The advantages of using biometrics for authentication are that they can be extremely accurate and fast. This allows for quick and reliable identity verification based on unique physical characteristics.
Discuss the limitations of biometric authentication.,"The limitations of biometric authentication include: \n1. **Private, but not secret**: While biometrics are private to an individual, they are not inherently secret. For example, a fingerprint or face scan could potentially be encoded from a glass or door handle. \n2. **Revocation is difficult**: If a biometric characteristic is compromised (e.g., an iris scan is stolen), it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to 'create a new one' unlike changing a password. This poses a significant challenge for recovery and continued security."
What is the core concept of 'Authorization' in computer systems?,"The core concept of Authorization in computer systems is to implement an access control mechanism based on a security policy. This policy specifies precisely who or what may have access to each specific resource within the system, and it defines the type of access (e.g., read, write, execute) that is permitted in each instance."
How does access control mediate interactions in a computer system?,"Access control mediates interactions in a computer system by acting as an intermediary between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and the system resources. These system resources can include applications, network sockets, and firewalls, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform permitted operations on them."
Identify the three basic elements in a security policy.,"The three basic elements in a security policy are: \n1. **Subject**: This refers to the process or users attempting to access a resource. \n2. **Object**: This is the resource that is security-sensitive and to which access is being controlled. \n3. **Operations**: These are the specific actions that can be taken using that resource, such as reading, writing, or executing."
Define 'Subject' in the context of a security policy.,"In the context of a security policy, a Subject is typically a process or a user who is held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a computer system. Subjects are the entities that request access to objects and perform operations."
What are the three types of subjects identified in a security policy?,"The three types of subjects identified in a security policy are: \n1. **Owner**: The creator of a resource, or for system resources, typically a system administrator. \n2. **Group**: A collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned. Users joining a group automatically gain its privileges, and users quitting lose them. \n3. **Other**: Users who can access the system but are not categorized as an owner or part of a specific group for a given resource, and are granted the least amount of access."
Explain the role of an 'Owner' as a type of subject.,"The role of an 'Owner' as a type of subject is typically assigned to the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. The owner usually has the highest level of control and privileges over the resource they own."
How do 'Groups' function in managing privileges for subjects?,"Groups function in managing privileges for subjects by allowing privileges to be assigned to a collection of users rather than individually. When a user joins a group, they automatically inherit the corresponding privileges. Conversely, if a user quits a group, they lose those permissions. This concept simplifies the management and updating of permissions, especially for multiple users, and a user may belong to multiple groups."
Who are categorized as 'Other' subjects and what level of access do they typically have?,Users categorized as 'Other' subjects are those who are able to access the system but are not included in the specific categories of owner or group for a particular resource. They are typically granted the least amount of access or privileges compared to owners and group members.
Define 'Object' within the framework of a security policy.,"Within the framework of a security policy, an 'Object' is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information, and its access is governed by the security policy."

What is the primary purpose of a password?,"The primary purpose of a password is to serve as the most common way to prove who you are, acting as a key component in authentication mechanisms across various networking websites and applications."
Why is a complex password considered strong?,"A complex password is considered strong because it is a long combination of unique characters that is difficult for other people to guess or for technology to crack. Its varied character types (numbers, letters, symbols) and lack of predictability make it robust against common hacking methods."
What happens if a user quits a group in an authentication system?,"If a user quits a group in an authentication system, they will lose the corresponding permissions and privileges that were assigned to that group. This ensures that access rights are dynamically managed based on group membership."
How do cybercriminals typically access non-dictionary words for password cracking?,Cybercriminals typically access non-dictionary words for password cracking by utilizing publicly known combinations of characters that are stored in large databases. They then use specialized software to input thousands of these passwords per second in an attempt to guess user credentials.
What is the significance of changing passwords periodically?,"The significance of changing passwords periodically, such as every six months, is a requirement for a strong authentication system. This practice helps to mitigate the risk of compromised passwords being used over extended periods and ensures that even if a password is leaked, its utility to an attacker is limited by time."
Can a user belong to multiple groups in a security policy?,"Yes, a user may belong to multiple groups in a security policy. This allows for flexible assignment of privileges, as the user will automatically have the corresponding privileges from all groups they are a member of."
What are 'network sockets' in the context of system resources?,"Network sockets, in the context of system resources, are specific communication endpoints that access control mediates between a user (or process) and the system. They are considered objects within a security policy, meaning access to them is controlled."
Why is it important for new passwords to be different from used ones?,"It is important for new passwords to be different from used ones as a requirement for a strong authentication system. This prevents users from cycling through a small set of old passwords, which could be known to attackers, thereby maintaining a higher level of security."
"What is the primary concern with biometrics being 'private, but not secret'?","The primary concern with biometrics being 'private, but not secret' is that while they are unique to an individual, their physical manifestation might be captured or replicated from common interactions. For instance, a fingerprint could be lifted from a glass or a door handle, potentially compromising the biometric data without the user's direct knowledge or consent."
How does the cost of physical belongings impact their use for authentication?,"The cost of physical belongings can significantly impact their use for authentication, especially for large-scale deployments. For example, banks with millions of customers might face substantial expenses, with each token or smartcard costing between $15-$25, making it a high-cost solution."
What does 'QWERTY' refer to in the context of weak passwords?,"'QWERTY' refers to a recognizable keystroke pattern on a standard keyboard. Passwords that use this sequence, or similar easily identifiable patterns, are considered weak because they are simple to guess or crack by attackers."
What is the role of a system administrator concerning resource ownership?,"For system resources, the ownership may belong to a system administrator. In this role, the system administrator acts as the 'Owner' subject, typically having the highest level of control and privileges over those specific resources."
How does a security policy define access to resources?,"A security policy defines access to resources by specifying who or what (the subject) may have access to each specific resource (the object) in a computer system. It also dictates the precise type of access (the operations) that is permitted in each instance, ensuring controlled and authorized interactions."
What are 'firewalls' in the context of system resources and access control?,"Firewalls, in the context of system resources, are components that access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and the system. They are considered objects within a security policy, meaning their access and configuration are subject to defined security rules."
Why are personal information details considered a characteristic of weak passwords?,"Personal information details, such as date of birth, address, or name, are considered a characteristic of weak passwords because they are often publicly available or easily discoverable by attackers. Including such information makes a password highly predictable and vulnerable to social engineering or brute-force attacks based on personal data."
What is the consequence of a physical belonging being damaged for authentication?,"The consequence of a physical belonging being damaged for authentication is that it can render the item unusable. Examples include a smartcard being damaged in a washing machine or an electronic token experiencing battery death, both of which prevent the user from authenticating."
How does the 'Number of Users with Password (absolute)' column in the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table contribute to understanding weak passwords?,"The 'Number of Users with Password (absolute)' column in the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table contributes to understanding weak passwords by quantitatively demonstrating how many users employ these easily guessable combinations. A high number indicates widespread use of a particular weak password, highlighting its vulnerability and the risk it poses to user accounts."
What is the difference between a 'file' and a 'directory' as objects?,"Both 'files' and 'directories' are examples of 'Objects' in a computer system, meaning they are resources to which access is controlled. A 'file' is an entity used to contain information, while a 'directory' (or directory tree) is a structure used to organize and contain other files and directories."
Describe the concept of 'ridge ending' in a fingerprint biometric.,"The document mentions 'ridge ending' as a component of a fingerprint, which is a type of biometric characteristic. A ridge ending refers to the point where a friction ridge in a fingerprint pattern terminates, serving as a unique detail used for identification."
What are 'applications' in the context of system resources and access control?,"Applications, in the context of system resources, are programs or software that access control mediates between a user (or a process executing on behalf of a user) and the system. They are considered objects within a security policy, meaning access to and operations within them are controlled by defined rules."
How does the 'delta' feature contribute to fingerprint biometrics?,"The 'delta' feature is mentioned as a component of a fingerprint, which is a type of biometric characteristic. A delta in a fingerprint pattern is a triangular or tripod-like area where ridges diverge, serving as a significant point of reference for biometric identification."
What is the implication of 'non-standard algorithms' for physical belongings used in authentication?,"The implication of 'non-standard algorithms' for physical belongings used in authentication is that they can lead to issues with interoperability, security, and widespread adoption. If an algorithm is not standardized, it might be less scrutinized for vulnerabilities and could create compatibility problems with different systems or vendors."
Explain 'bifurcation' in the context of fingerprint biometrics.,"'Bifurcation' is a feature mentioned as part of a fingerprint, which is a biometric characteristic. In a fingerprint, a bifurcation is a point where a single friction ridge splits into two, forming a 'Y' shape. These unique points are crucial for accurate biometric identification."
What are 'mailboxes' as objects in a computer system?,"'Mailboxes' are examples of 'Objects' in a computer system, meaning they are resources to which access is controlled. They are entities used to contain and/or receive information, specifically messages, and their access is governed by the security policy."
How does 'memory' function as an object in a computer system?,"'Memory' functions as an 'Object' in a computer system, meaning it is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information, such as data and program instructions, and access to different segments or portions of memory is managed by the security policy."
What is the significance of 'segments' as objects in a computer system?,"'Segments' are examples of 'Objects' in a computer system, meaning they are resources to which access is controlled. They represent portions of memory or data structures that contain and/or receive information, and access to these specific segments is managed by the security policy."
How does 'face recognition' contribute to biometric authentication?,'Face recognition' contributes to biometric authentication by measuring unique physical characteristics of an individual's face. This method is used to verify identity and is noted for being extremely accurate and fast in identifying users.
What is the role of 'voice' in biometric authentication?,"'Voice' plays a role in biometric authentication as a physical characteristic that can be measured to verify identity.
