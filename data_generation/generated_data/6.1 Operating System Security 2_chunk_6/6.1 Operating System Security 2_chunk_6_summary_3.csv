Provide a comprehensive summary of Attestation with SGX.,"SGX (Software Guard Extensions) provides an attestation service that allows for verifying the integrity and trustworthiness of enclaves. The integrity measurement architecture involves measuring the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and page locations of an enclave. This measurement is then used in an attestation protocol, which involves an attestation key and a cryptographic protocol. SGX supports two types of attestation: Remote Attestation, where a remote client verifies the enclave's integrity, and Local Attestation, where multiple enclaves collaborate and must prove their trustworthiness to each other. In local attestation, enclaves exchange data at runtime and need to establish trust. The diagram shows two enclaves interacting with each other, mediated by the Operating System and underlying Hardware, with SGX providing the secure environment."
Summarise the benefits and challenges of implementing SGX attestation.,"SGX attestation offers benefits such as enabling remote clients to verify the integrity of code running within an enclave, and allowing collaborating enclaves to establish mutual trust. The integrity measurement architecture ensures that the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and page locations of an enclave are measured.
