Provide a comprehensive summary of Attestation with SGX.,"Attestation with SGX provides a service to verify the integrity of code and data within an enclave. This service includes an **Integrity measurement architecture**, which involves measuring the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and page locations of an enclave. It also utilizes an **Attestation protocol**, which relies on an attestation key and a cryptographic protocol.
