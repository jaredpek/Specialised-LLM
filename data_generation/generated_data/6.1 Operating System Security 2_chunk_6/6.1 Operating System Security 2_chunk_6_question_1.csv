What is attestation with SGX?,"Attestation with SGX refers to a service provided by SGX (Software Guard Extensions) that allows for the verification of the integrity and authenticity of code running within an enclave. This service includes an integrity measurement architecture, which measures the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and page locations of an enclave. It also involves an attestation protocol that utilizes an attestation key and a cryptographic protocol to establish trust."
What is the integrity measurement architecture in SGX attestation?,"The integrity measurement architecture in SGX attestation is a process that measures various components of an enclave to ensure its integrity. This measurement includes the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, and the location of each page within the enclave. This measured value serves as a unique fingerprint of the enclave's state."
What is the attestation protocol in SGX?,The attestation protocol in SGX is a mechanism that uses an attestation key and a cryptographic protocol to verify the integrity and authenticity of an enclave. This protocol allows a party to confirm that the code running in an enclave is as expected and has not been tampered with.
Explain remote attestation in SGX.,"Remote attestation in SGX is a process where a remote client verifies the integrity of the code running within an enclave. This allows a client to trust that the enclave is executing the intended, untampered code without needing to be physically present."
What is local attestation in SGX?,"Local attestation in SGX is a scenario where multiple enclaves collaborate on a shared task and exchange data at runtime. In such cases, these collaborating enclaves need to prove to each other that they are trusted. This ensures that the data exchanged between enclaves is handled by verified and secure entities."
Describe the mechanism of local attestation between enclaves.,"In local attestation, multiple enclaves that are collaborating on a task and exchanging data at runtime must prove their trustworthiness to each other. This process ensures that sensitive operations involving shared data are conducted by verified and secure enclaves."
What is AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)?,"AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a hardware extension designed to protect virtual machines (VMs) from an untrusted hypervisor. It provides basic memory encryption for protecting VMs, encrypts CPU registers, and adds integrity protection."
What are the different versions or features of AMD SEV?,"AMD SEV has evolved with several features: SEV, released in 2016, provides basic memory encryption for protecting VMs. SEV-ES (Encrypted State), released in 2018, encrypts CPU registers. SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging), released in 2020, adds integrity protection."
How does SEV protect VMs from the hypervisor?,"SEV protects VMs by encrypting their data, including memory pages, registers, and configurations. This encryption ensures that the hypervisor, which is considered untrusted, cannot access or tamper with the guest VM's sensitive data."
What role does the AMD Secure Processor play in SEV?,The AMD Secure Processor is utilized in SEV to manage the encryption keys. This dedicated secure hardware component ensures that the encryption keys used for protecting VM data are handled securely and are not accessible to the untrusted hypervisor.
What is the impact of SEV on virtual machines in terms of modification?,SEV offers transparent encryption with minimal modifications required to the virtual machine. This means that VMs can benefit from enhanced security without significant changes to their existing software or configurations.

What are the two environments created by ARM TrustZone?,"ARM TrustZone creates two environments: the 'Normal world' and the 'Secure world'. The Normal world runs normal, unprotected applications with a rich operating system, while the Secure world runs sensitive, protected applications with a smaller, secure operating system, isolating them from the Normal world."
Describe the Normal world in ARM TrustZone.,"The Normal world in ARM TrustZone is where normal, unprotected applications and a rich operating system run. Applications in the Normal world have restricted access to the hardware resources that are available in the Secure world."
Describe the Secure world in ARM TrustZone.,"The Secure world in ARM TrustZone is designed for sensitive, protected applications and a smaller, secure operating system. It isolates these applications and the OS from the untrusted Normal world. Applications in the Secure world have full access to the hardware resources that are in the Normal world."
How does ARM TrustZone manage the switching between Normal and Secure worlds?,"ARM TrustZone manages switching between the Normal and Secure worlds using a Non-secure bit in the Secure Configuration Register, which determines the current running world. A special instruction, Secure Monitor Call (SMC), is used to transition to a 'secure monitor' mode. In this mode, cleaning operations are performed before entering the other world."
What is the role of the Non-secure bit in ARM TrustZone?,"The Non-secure bit, located in the Secure Configuration Register, is used in ARM TrustZone to determine which world the processor is currently running in. A value of 1 typically indicates the Normal world, while a value of 0 indicates the Secure world."
What is the Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction in ARM TrustZone?,"The Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction in ARM TrustZone is a special instruction used by the processor to switch between the Normal and Secure worlds. When executed, it causes the processor to enter a 'secure monitor' mode, where it performs necessary cleaning tasks before entering the target world."
What is the 'secure monitor' mode in ARM TrustZone?,"The 'secure monitor' mode in ARM TrustZone is a third privilege mode, in addition to user and kernel modes. It is entered via the Secure Monitor Call (SMC) instruction and is used to facilitate context switching between the Normal and Secure worlds, performing necessary cleanup operations."
What are the positive usages of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)?,"Positive usages of TEEs include cloud computing, where users do not need to trust the cloud provider; digital rights management; and applications involving cryptocurrency and blockchain."
What are the negative usages of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)?,"A negative usage of TEEs is when adversaries leverage them to hide malicious activities, enabling stealthier attacks. This can conflict with malware analysis efforts, making it harder to detect and combat threats."
Provide examples of applications that can be protected by TEEs.,"Examples of applications that can be protected by TEEs include those related to Hadoop, gaming (represented by a game controller icon), blockchain technology, and potentially any application where sensitive operations need to be secured from the underlying system, including malware."
What is the primary function of SGX attestation?,"The primary function of SGX attestation is to provide a service that verifies the integrity and authenticity of code running within an enclave. This allows remote parties to trust that the enclave is executing the intended, untampered code."

What is the primary difference between the Normal world and the Secure world in ARM TrustZone?,"The primary difference lies in their purpose and access privileges. The Normal world runs standard applications and a rich OS with restricted hardware access, while the Secure world runs sensitive applications and a secure OS, isolated from the Normal world and with full hardware access."
What is the function of the Secure Monitor Mode in ARM TrustZone?,The Secure Monitor Mode in ARM TrustZone acts as an intermediary for context switching between the Normal and Secure worlds. It is entered via an SMC instruction and performs necessary cleanup before transitioning to the other world.
How does ARM TrustZone ensure isolation between worlds?,"ARM TrustZone ensures isolation by creating two distinct execution environments, the Normal world and the Secure world, each with its own OS and access controls. The Secure world is specifically designed to isolate sensitive operations from the less trusted Normal world."
