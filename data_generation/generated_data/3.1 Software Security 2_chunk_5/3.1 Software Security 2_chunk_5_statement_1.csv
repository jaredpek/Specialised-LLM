Define scripting languages and explain their primary function.,"Scripting languages are programming languages used to construct commands, also known as scripts, from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime. Their primary function is to then pass these scripts to another software component for execution. They are typically viewed as domain-specific languages tailored for a particular environment and are referred to as very high-level programming languages."
Provide examples of common scripting languages.,"Examples of common scripting languages include Bash, PowerShell, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, Safe-Tcl, and JavaScript."
What constitutes a scripting vulnerability?,"A scripting vulnerability arises when an attacker can hide additional malicious commands within the user input. When this compromised input is processed, the system will execute the malicious command without any awareness or explicit authorization, leading to unintended actions or data breaches."
"Explain the role of the `system` command in the context of command injection, as described in the document.","In the context of command injection, the `system` command is a function that takes a string as input. It then spawns a shell, which is a command-line interpreter, and executes the provided string as a command within that shell. This makes it a critical point of vulnerability if the input string can be manipulated by an attacker."
Describe the normal operation of the `display_file` function shown in Example 1.,"The `display_file` function takes a `char* filename` as input. Inside the function, it constructs a command string using `snprintf` to form ""cat %s"" where `%s` is replaced by the provided `filename`. For a normal case, if a client sets `filename=hello.txt`, the command constructed would be `cat hello.txt`. This command is then executed by the `system` function, which would display the contents of `hello.txt`."
"How does an attacker exploit the `display_file` function using command injection, as demonstrated in the document?","An attacker exploits the `display_file` function by providing a compromised input for the `filename`. Instead of a simple filename, the attacker sets `filename = hello.txt; rm -rf /`. When this input is used to construct the command, it becomes `cat hello.txt; rm -rf /`. The semicolon (`;`) acts as a command separator, causing the `system` function to first execute `cat hello.txt` and then, immediately after, execute the malicious command `rm -rf /`, which attempts to delete all files the script has permission to delete."
What is the impact of the command injection `hello.txt; rm -rf /`?,"The impact of the command injection `hello.txt; rm -rf /` is severe. After displaying the `hello.txt` file, the `rm -rf /` command is executed. This command recursively (`-r`) and forcefully (`-f`) deletes files starting from the root directory (`/`). Consequently, all files the script has permission to delete are removed from the system, potentially leading to data loss and system compromise."
List the primary defenses against Command Injection.,"The primary defenses against Command Injection include avoiding shell commands, using more secure APIs, implementing input inspection, and dropping privileges."
"Explain how using more secure APIs helps defend against command injection, providing examples.","Using more secure APIs helps defend against command injection by providing functions that execute commands without directly invoking a shell, or by handling arguments in a way that prevents them from being interpreted as commands. For example, in Python, `subprocess.run()` is a more secure API, and in C, `execve()` is a secure alternative. These APIs typically treat user input as data rather than executable commands, thereby mitigating the risk of injection."
Describe the concept of 'Input inspection' as a defense against command injection.,"Input inspection is a defense mechanism against command injection that involves carefully examining and processing user input before it is used in commands. It encompasses three main strategies: Sanitization, which involves escaping dangerous characters; Validation, which means validating and rejecting any malformed input; and Whitelisting, which restricts input to only choose from a predefined set of allowed values."
What is 'Sanitization' in the context of defending against command injection?,"Sanitization, in the context of defending against command injection, is a technique within input inspection where dangerous characters in user input are escaped. Escaping dangerous characters means modifying them so they are treated as literal data rather than command-executing elements, preventing them from being interpreted as part of a malicious command."
How does 'Whitelisting' contribute to defending against command injection?,"Whitelisting contributes to defending against command injection by enforcing a strict policy where only explicitly allowed values or patterns are accepted from user input. Any input that does not match the whitelist is rejected. This approach is highly effective because it prevents any unexpected or malicious commands from being introduced, as only known safe inputs are permitted."
Explain the 'Drop privileges' defense mechanism against command injection.,"The 'Drop privileges' defense mechanism against command injection involves running processes as non-root users. By reducing the privileges of the user account under which a script or application executes, the potential impact of a successful command injection attack is significantly minimized. Even if an attacker manages to inject and execute a malicious command, its ability to cause harm (e.g., delete critical system files, access sensitive data) is limited by the restricted permissions of the non-root user."
Define Structured Query Language (SQL).,"Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language specifically designed for managing data within a database. It is used for tasks such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing data, and deleting records or entire tables."
Provide the basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records.,"The basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records includes `SELECT name FROM Accounts` to retrieve specific columns, or `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'` to retrieve all columns for records matching a specific condition."
Illustrate the SQL syntax for adding or updating data in a table.,"To add data, the syntax is `INSERT INTO Accounts (name, age, password) VALUES ('Charlie', 32, 'efgh')`. To update existing data, the syntax is `UPDATE Accounts SET password='hello' WHERE name= 'Alice'`."
Show the SQL syntax for deleting records or an entire table.,"To delete a set of records, the syntax is `DELETE FROM Accounts WHERE age >= 30`. To delete an entire table, the syntax is `DROP TABLE Accounts`."
Explain the use of '--' and ';' in SQL syntax.,"In SQL syntax, `--` is used to denote single-line comments, meaning any text following `--` on the same line is ignored by the database. The semicolon (`;`) is used to separate different SQL statements, allowing multiple commands to be executed sequentially within a single query or script."
"Describe a normal case of an SQL query that takes user input, as shown in Example 2.","A normal case of an SQL query that takes user input involves a statement like `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'`, where `$name` is a placeholder for user-provided input. If a user sets `$name=Bob`, the query becomes `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Bob'`, which then retrieves all records from the `Accounts` table where the `name` column is 'Bob'."
How does an attacker use `OR 1=1 --` to perform an SQL injection?,"An attacker uses `OR 1=1 --` to perform an SQL injection by manipulating the user input `$name`. If the attacker sets `$name = ' OR 1=1 --'`, the original query `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'` transforms into `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= '' OR 1=1 --`. The `OR 1=1` condition is always true, and the `--` comments out the rest of the original query. This effectively bypasses any authentication or filtering, causing the database to select and display the entire client database."
What is the consequence of an SQL injection using `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --`?,"The consequence of an SQL injection using `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --` is the deletion of the entire `Accounts` table. When an attacker sets `$name = '; DROP TABLE Accounts --'`, the original query `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'` becomes `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= ''; DROP TABLE ACCOUNTS --`. The semicolon (`;`) separates the malicious `DROP TABLE Accounts` command from the initial query, and the `--` comments out any subsequent parts of the original query. This results in a new statement being injected and executed, which deletes the entire `Accounts` table."
List the main defenses against SQL Injection.,"The main defenses against SQL Injection include using parameterized queries, employing an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and implementing input inspection."
Explain how parameterized queries defend against SQL injection.,"Parameterized queries defend against SQL injection by ensuring that user input is treated strictly as data, not as part of the command itself. Instead of directly embedding user input into the SQL string, placeholders are used. The database then processes the query structure and the data separately. For example, `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))` treats `name` as a value for the placeholder `?`, preventing it from being interpreted as executable SQL code."
What is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and how does it help reduce SQL injection risk?,"An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a programming technique that abstracts SQL generation. It allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, mapping database tables to objects and rows to instances. By automatically generating SQL queries based on object interactions, ORMs inherently reduce the risk of SQL injection because they typically use parameterized queries internally, ensuring that user-provided data is correctly escaped and treated as data rather than executable commands."
Provide an example of an ORM class definition as shown in the document.,"An example of an ORM class definition is: `class user(DBObject) { name = Column(String(255)); age = Column(Integer); password = Column(String(255)); }`. This defines a `user` object with `name`, `age`, and `password` attributes, mapping them to database columns with specified data types and lengths."
Describe 'Input inspection' as a defense against SQL injection.,"Input inspection as a defense against SQL injection involves scrutinizing and processing user input to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed. This defense strategy includes Sanitization, which means escaping dangerous characters; Validation, which involves validating and rejecting any malformed input; and Whitelisting, which restricts input to only choose from a predefined set of allowed values, ensuring only safe data is processed."
What is 'Sanitization' in the context of defending against SQL injection?,"Sanitization, in the context of defending against SQL injection, is a technique within input inspection where dangerous characters in user input are escaped. This process modifies characters that could be interpreted as SQL commands (like single quotes, semicolons, or comment indicators) so they are treated as literal data, thereby preventing them from altering the intended structure or logic of the SQL query."
How does 'Validation and rejection of malformed input' protect against SQL injection?,'Validation and rejection of malformed input' protects against SQL injection by establishing rules for what constitutes acceptable input. Any user input that does not conform to these predefined rules or expected formats is considered malformed and is rejected. This prevents attackers from submitting unusual or syntactically incorrect strings that might exploit vulnerabilities in the SQL query construction process.
What is JavaScript and how is it used in web applications?,"JavaScript is a programming language specifically designed for web applications. The server sends JavaScript code to the client's web browser, and the browser then executes this code. Its primary use is to make websites more interactive, enabling dynamic content, animations, form validations, and other client-side functionalities."
How can JavaScript be directly embedded into HTML?,"JavaScript can be directly embedded into HTML by enclosing the JavaScript code within `<script>` and `</script>` tags. These script tags can be placed within the `<body>` or `<head>` sections of an HTML document. For example, `<body><script>alert(Date())</script></body>` demonstrates embedding a JavaScript alert function directly within the HTML body."
What does the JavaScript code `alert(Date())` do when embedded in HTML?,"When the JavaScript code `alert(Date())` is embedded in HTML and executed by a web browser, it displays a pop-up dialog box (an 'alert') to the user. The content of this alert box is the current date and time, as returned by the `Date()` object in JavaScript, formatted according to the user's locale and timezone."
Describe the CardSystems SQL injection attack.,"The CardSystems SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2007, targeted a major credit card processing company. This attack resulted in the theft of 263,000 accounts and 43 million credit card numbers, highlighting the severe financial and privacy implications of SQL injection vulnerabilities."
Summarize the 7-Eleven SQL injection attack.,"The 7-Eleven SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2013, involved the stealing of 130 million credit card numbers. This incident demonstrates how SQL injection can be used to compromise large volumes of sensitive financial data from retail systems."
What was the impact of the Turkish government SQL injection attack?,"The Turkish government SQL injection attack, which took place in 2014, resulted in the breach of a government website. Attackers were able to erase debt owed to government agencies, indicating a significant impact on public financial records and potentially government operations."
Explain the Tesla SQL injection attack.,"The Tesla SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2018, involved breaching the company's website. Attackers were able to gain administrative privileges and steal user data, demonstrating how SQL injection can lead to elevated access and data exfiltration in high-profile organizations."
What was compromised in the Cisco SQL injection attack?,"In the Cisco SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2014, attackers were able to gain shell access. Gaining shell access means the attackers could execute commands directly on the compromised server, potentially leading to full system control and further exploitation."
Describe the Fortnite SQL injection attack.,"The Fortnite SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2019, targeted an online game with over 350 million users. The attack allowed access to user data, demonstrating how SQL injection can impact large user bases in online gaming platforms, compromising personal information."

What are the characteristics of scripting languages?,Scripting languages are characterized by their ability to construct commands (scripts) from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime. The constructed script is then passed to another software component for execution. They are often viewed as domain-specific languages for particular environments and are generally referred to as very high-level programming languages.
Provide the C code snippet for the `display_file` function vulnerable to command injection.,"The C code snippet for the `display_file` function is:\n```c\nvoid display_file(char* filename) {\n  char cmd[512];\n  snprintf(cmd, sizeof(cmd), ""cat %s"", filename);\n  system(cmd);\n}\n```"
What is the purpose of `snprintf` in the `display_file` function?,"In the `display_file` function, `snprintf` is used to safely format and store a string into a buffer. Specifically, it constructs the command string `""cat %s""` by substituting `%s` with the `filename` provided by the user, ensuring that the buffer `cmd` does not overflow by limiting the output to `sizeof(cmd)`."
How does 'Validation and rejection of malformed input' apply to command injection defenses?,'Validation and rejection of malformed input' as a defense against command injection means that any user input that does not conform to expected formats or contains characters not allowed for a specific field is identified as malformed and subsequently rejected. This prevents attackers from injecting unexpected characters or command sequences that could be interpreted as executable commands by the system.
What is the general principle behind 'Avoid shell commands' as a defense against command injection?,"The general principle behind 'Avoid shell commands' as a defense against command injection is to prevent the application from directly invoking a system shell to execute commands. Shells are powerful interpreters that can parse and execute multiple commands separated by special characters. By avoiding direct shell execution, the risk of an attacker injecting malicious commands through user input is significantly reduced, as the input is less likely to be interpreted as executable code."
What is the primary goal of JavaScript in web applications?,"The primary goal of JavaScript in web applications is to make the website more interactive. It achieves this by enabling dynamic content, client-side scripting, and responsive user interfaces, all executed directly within the user's browser."
What is the significance of `name= 'Alice'` in the `UPDATE` SQL statement?,"In the `UPDATE Accounts SET password='hello' WHERE name= 'Alice'` SQL statement, `name= 'Alice'` is the `WHERE` clause condition. This condition specifies that only the record(s) in the `Accounts` table where the `name` column has the value 'Alice' should have their `password` updated to 'hello'. It ensures that the update operation is applied to a specific subset of data rather than the entire table."
Provide an example of an HTML structure that embeds JavaScript to display an alert.,An example of an HTML structure that embeds JavaScript to display an alert is:\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n<script>alert(Date())</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nThis structure includes a `<script>` tag within the `<body>` that contains JavaScript code to trigger an alert box showing the current date and time.
How does the `WHERE` clause function in SQL queries for obtaining records?,"The `WHERE` clause in SQL queries functions as a filter to specify conditions that must be met for records to be included in the result set. For example, in `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'`, only records from the `Accounts` table where the `name` column is exactly 'Alice' will be returned, effectively narrowing down the selection of records."
