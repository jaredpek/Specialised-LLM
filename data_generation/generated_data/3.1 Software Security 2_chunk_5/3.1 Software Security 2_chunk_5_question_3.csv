What are scripting languages?,"Scripting languages are very high-level programming languages used to construct commands, also known as scripts, from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime. These scripts are then passed to another software component for execution. They are typically viewed as domain-specific languages tailored for a particular environment."
How do scripting languages function?,"Scripting languages function by constructing commands, referred to as scripts, at runtime. These scripts are built using predefined code fragments combined with user input. Once constructed, the script is then passed to a separate software component, which is responsible for its execution."
Can you provide examples of scripting languages?,"Examples of scripting languages include Bash, PowerShell, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, Safe-Tcl, and JavaScript."
What is a scripting vulnerability?,"A scripting vulnerability occurs when an attacker can hide additional malicious commands within the user input provided to a system. The system, unaware of the malicious nature of these hidden commands, proceeds to execute them, leading to unauthorized or unintended actions."
How can an attacker exploit scripting vulnerabilities?,"An attacker can exploit scripting vulnerabilities by embedding additional, malicious commands within the user input that is processed by a scripting language. When the system receives this input, it constructs and executes a script that includes the attacker's hidden commands, without any awareness that these commands are malicious."
What is Command Injection?,"Command Injection is a type of scripting vulnerability where an attacker can hide additional commands in the user input, which are then executed by the system without its awareness. This typically occurs when an application constructs a system command using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system's shell."
How does the `system` command work in the context of command injection?,"The `system` command, in the context of command injection, takes a string as input. It then spawns a shell, which is a command-line interpreter, and executes the provided string as a command within that shell. This makes it a common target for command injection attacks if the input string is not properly sanitized."
Describe a normal case scenario for the `display_file` function.,"In a normal case scenario for the `display_file` function, a client sets the `filename` variable to a legitimate file, such as `hello.txt`. The function then constructs a command like `cat hello.txt` using `snprintf` and executes it via `system(cmd)`, resulting in the display of the contents of `hello.txt`."
How can an attacker compromise the `display_file` function using command injection?,"An attacker can compromise the `display_file` function by setting the `filename` variable to a string that includes additional commands, such as `hello.txt; rm -rf /`. When the `snprintf` function constructs the command, it becomes `cat hello.txt; rm -rf /`. The `system` command then executes both the `cat` command and the malicious `rm -rf /` command, leading to the deletion of files the script has permission to remove."
What is the impact of a successful command injection attack using `rm -rf /`?,"The impact of a successful command injection attack using `rm -rf /` is severe. After displaying the intended file, the malicious command `rm -rf /` will be executed. This command attempts to recursively delete all files and directories from the root directory (`/`) that the script has permission to delete, potentially leading to significant data loss and system compromise."
What are the general defenses against Command Injection?,"General defenses against Command Injection include avoiding shell commands, using more secure APIs, implementing input inspection, and dropping privileges."
How can using more secure APIs help prevent Command Injection?,Using more secure APIs helps prevent Command Injection by providing functions that execute commands without directly invoking a shell or by handling arguments in a way that prevents command concatenation. Examples include Python's `subprocess.run()` and C's `execve()`.
What is input inspection in the context of Command Injection defenses?,"Input inspection, as a defense against Command Injection, involves carefully examining and processing user input before it is used to construct commands. This includes sanitization, validation and rejection of malformed input, and whitelisting."
Explain sanitization as a defense against Command Injection.,"Sanitization, as a defense against Command Injection, involves escaping dangerous characters within user input. This process modifies or removes characters that could be interpreted as command separators or special shell characters, thereby preventing them from being executed as part of an injected command."
Explain validation and rejection of malformed input as a defense against Command Injection.,"Validation and rejection of malformed input, as a defense against Command Injection, involves checking user input against expected formats or patterns. If the input does not conform to these predefined rules, it is considered malformed and is rejected, preventing potentially malicious or unexpected data from being processed."
Explain whitelisting as a defense against Command Injection.,"Whitelisting, as a defense against Command Injection, is a security strategy where only explicitly allowed values or patterns are accepted from user input. Any input that does not match an entry on the whitelist is rejected, significantly reducing the attack surface by preventing the injection of unauthorized commands or data."
"What does ""Drop privileges"" mean as a defense against Command Injection?","Dropping privileges, as a defense against Command Injection, means running processes as non-root users. By reducing the permissions of the process that handles user input and executes commands, the potential damage an attacker can inflict through a successful injection is minimized, as the malicious commands will only be able to perform actions allowed by the lower-privileged user."
What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?,Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used for managing data in a database.
What is the basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records?,"The basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records involves using the `SELECT` statement. For example, `SELECT name FROM Accounts` retrieves the 'name' column from the 'Accounts' table, and `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'` retrieves all columns from the 'Accounts' table where the 'name' is 'Alice'."
How do you add or update data in an SQL table?,"To add data to an SQL table, you use the `INSERT INTO` statement, such as `INSERT INTO Accounts (name, age, password) VALUES ('Charlie', 32, 'efgh')`. To update existing data, you use the `UPDATE` statement, for example, `UPDATE Accounts SET password='hello' WHERE name= 'Alice'`."
How do you delete records or an entire table in SQL?,"To delete a set of records from an SQL table, you use the `DELETE FROM` statement with a `WHERE` clause, such as `DELETE FROM Accounts WHERE age >= 30`. To delete an entire table, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement, for example, `DROP TABLE Accounts`."
What are some other syntax characters in SQL?,Other syntax characters in SQL include `--` for single-line comments and `;` to separate different statements.
Provide an example of a single-line comment in SQL.,An example of a single-line comment in SQL is `-- This is a comment`. Any text following `--` on the same line is ignored by the SQL parser.
How are different statements separated in SQL?,Different statements in SQL are typically separated by a semicolon (`;`). This character indicates the end of one SQL command and the beginning of another.
Describe a normal case scenario for an SQL query involving a user-provided name.,"In a normal case scenario for an SQL query involving a user-provided name, a user sets a variable like `$name` to a value, for instance, `Bob`. The database then executes a query such as `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Bob'`, which correctly retrieves all records from the `Accounts` table where the name matches 'Bob'."
How can an attacker use `OR 1=1 --` to compromise an SQL query?,"An attacker can use `OR 1=1 --` to compromise an SQL query by setting the `$name` input to `' OR 1=1 --`. This transforms a query like `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'` into `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '' OR 1=1 --`. Since `1=1` is always true, the `WHERE` clause becomes true for all records, and the `--` comments out the rest of the original query, effectively selecting and displaying the entire client database."
What is the impact of an SQL injection attack using `OR 1=1 --`?,"The impact of an SQL injection attack using `OR 1=1 --` is that the entire client database is selected and displayed. This occurs because the injected condition `OR 1=1` evaluates to true for every record, bypassing any intended authentication or filtering, and the `--` comments out any subsequent parts of the original query."
How can an attacker use `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --` to compromise an SQL query?,"An attacker can use `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --` to compromise an SQL query by setting the `$name` input to this string. This transforms a query like `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'` into `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ''; DROP TABLE Accounts --`. The semicolon (`;`) terminates the original `SELECT` statement, and then a new, malicious statement `DROP TABLE Accounts` is injected and executed, which deletes the entire `Accounts` table. The `--` comments out any remaining part of the original query."
What is the impact of an SQL injection attack using `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --`?,"The impact of an SQL injection attack using `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --` is the deletion of the entire `Accounts` table. The injected statement `DROP TABLE Accounts` is executed as a new command after the original query is prematurely terminated by the semicolon, leading to significant data loss and potential service disruption."
Provide an example of a real-world SQL Injection attack involving CardSystems.,"In 2006, CardSystems, a major credit card processing company, suffered a real-world SQL Injection attack. This attack resulted in the stealing of 263,000 accounts and 43 million credit cards."
Describe the SQL Injection attack on the Turkish government.,"In 2007, the Turkish government experienced an SQL Injection attack. This breach allowed attackers to access and erase debt records belonging to government agencies by compromising their website."
What was the impact of the SQL Injection attack on Cisco?,"In 2014, Cisco was affected by an SQL Injection attack. The impact of this attack was that the attackers were able to gain shell access to their systems."
What happened in the 7-Eleven SQL Injection attack?,"In 2013, 7-Eleven was subjected to an SQL Injection attack. This attack led to the stealing of 130 million credit card numbers."
Describe the SQL Injection attack on Tesla.,"In 2018, Tesla experienced an SQL Injection attack. This attack allowed the perpetrators to breach the company's website, gain administrative privileges, and steal user data."
What was the consequence of the SQL Injection attack on Fortnite?,"In 2019, Fortnite, an online game with over 350 million users, was targeted by an SQL Injection attack. The consequence was that the attack could access user data."

When did the Tesla SQL Injection attack occur?,The Tesla SQL Injection attack occurred in 2018.
When did the Fortnite SQL Injection attack occur?,The Fortnite SQL Injection attack occurred in 2019.
What are the general defenses against SQL Injection?,"General defenses against SQL Injection include using parameterized queries, employing an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and implementing input inspection."
How do parameterized queries defend against SQL Injection?,"Parameterized queries defend against SQL Injection by ensuring that user input is treated strictly as data, not as part of a command. This prevents an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code because the input values are passed separately from the SQL statement, and the database engine handles them as literal values rather than executable commands. An example is `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`."
Provide an example of a parameterized query.,"An example of a parameterized query is `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`. In this example, `?` is a placeholder for the `name` variable, ensuring that the value of `name` is treated as data and not as executable SQL code."
What is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and how does it help defend against SQL Injection?,"An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a programming technique that abstracts SQL generation, thereby reducing the risk of SQL injection. ORMs allow developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, mapping database tables to objects. By automatically generating SQL queries based on these objects, ORMs handle the proper escaping and parameterization of input, making it less likely for developers to introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities manually. An example class definition for a user object might be `class user(DBObject) { name = Column(String(255)); age = Column(Integer); password = Column(String(255)); }`."
Explain input inspection as a defense against SQL Injection.,"Input inspection, as a defense against SQL Injection, involves scrutinizing and processing user input to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed. This defense mechanism encompasses sanitization, which escapes dangerous characters; validation and rejection of malformed input, which ensures input conforms to expected formats; and whitelisting, which only allows predefined, safe values."
How does sanitization help defend against SQL Injection?,"Sanitization helps defend against SQL Injection by escaping dangerous characters within user input. This process modifies or removes characters that could be interpreted as SQL command separators or special SQL operators, thereby preventing them from being executed as part of an injected SQL query."
How does validation and rejection of malformed input help defend against SQL Injection?,"Validation and rejection of malformed input help defend against SQL Injection by checking user input against expected data types, lengths, and patterns. If the input does not meet these predefined criteria, it is considered malformed and is rejected, preventing potentially malicious or unexpected SQL fragments from being processed by the database."
How does whitelisting help defend against SQL Injection?,"Whitelisting helps defend against SQL Injection by only allowing input values that are explicitly defined as safe or acceptable. Any input that does not match an entry on the whitelist is rejected, significantly reducing the attack surface by preventing the injection of unauthorized SQL commands or data."
What is JavaScript?,"JavaScript is a programming language specifically designed for web applications. It is executed by the client's browser after being sent from the server, and its primary role is to make websites more interactive."
How does JavaScript function in web applications?,"In web applications, JavaScript functions by being sent from the server to the client's browser. Once received, the browser executes the JavaScript code. This execution allows for dynamic content, client-side validation, and interactive elements, making the website more engaging for the user."
How does JavaScript make websites more interactive?,"JavaScript makes websites more interactive by enabling dynamic content updates, client-side scripting, and responsive user interfaces. It allows web pages to react to user actions, manipulate HTML and CSS, and communicate with servers asynchronously, all without requiring a full page reload."
How can JavaScript be embedded in HTML?,"JavaScript can be directly embedded in HTML using the `<script>` tag. This tag encloses JavaScript code within an HTML document, allowing the browser to execute it as part of rendering the web page."
Provide an example of JavaScript embedded in HTML.,"An example of JavaScript embedded in HTML is:\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n<script>alert(Date())</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nIn this example, the `<script>` tags contain JavaScript code `alert(Date())`, which, when executed by the browser, displays a pop-up alert box showing the current date and time."
What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?,"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that typically involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users. While the document provides an example of JavaScript embedding, XSS leverages this capability to execute attacker-controlled scripts in a victim's browser, often by embedding JavaScript directly into HTML."
What is the purpose of the `snprintf` function in the `display_file` example?,"In the `display_file` example, the `snprintf` function is used to safely format and store a string into a buffer. Specifically, it constructs the command string, such as `""cat %s""`, by substituting `%s` with the provided `filename`, ensuring that the resulting string does not exceed the `cmd` buffer's size (`sizeof(cmd)`)."
What is the role of `char cmd[512];` in the `display_file` function?,"In the `display_file` function, `char cmd[512];` declares a character array named `cmd` with a size of 512 bytes. This array serves as a buffer to store the command string that will be constructed by `snprintf` and subsequently executed by the `system` function."
What is the significance of `sizeof(cmd)` in the `snprintf` call?,"The significance of `sizeof(cmd)` in the `snprintf` call is to specify the maximum number of bytes that `snprintf` should write into the `cmd` buffer, including the null terminator. This helps prevent buffer overflows, although it doesn't prevent command injection if malicious characters are part of the input string itself."
What is the `DBObject` in the ORM example?,"In the ORM example, `DBObject` is a base class or interface that the `user` class inherits from. It likely provides the fundamental functionalities and structure for mapping objects to database entities, abstracting the underlying database operations."
