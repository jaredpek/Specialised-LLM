What are scripting languages?,"Scripting languages are programming languages used to construct commands, also known as scripts, from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime. These scripts are then passed to another software component for execution. They are considered domain-specific languages for particular environments and are referred to as very high-level programming languages."
How do scripting languages work?,"Scripting languages work by constructing commands, or scripts, dynamically at runtime using predefined code fragments and user input. Once constructed, the script is then passed to another software component, which is responsible for its execution."
Can you provide examples of scripting languages?,"Examples of scripting languages include Bash, PowerShell, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, Safe-Tcl, and JavaScript."
What is a scripting vulnerability?,"A scripting vulnerability occurs when an attacker can hide additional malicious commands within the user input. The system then executes these malicious commands without any awareness, leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches."
How do attackers exploit scripting vulnerabilities?,"Attackers exploit scripting vulnerabilities by embedding additional, often malicious, commands within the user input. When this input is processed by a scripting language, the system executes these hidden commands without recognizing their malicious intent, leading to a compromise."
What is Command Injection?,"Command Injection is a type of scripting vulnerability where an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. This is typically achieved by manipulating user input that is then incorporated into a command executed by a system utility, such as a shell."
Explain the function of the `system` command in the context of command injection.,"The `system` command takes a string as input, spawns a shell, and then executes that input string as a command within the spawned shell. In the context of command injection, if user input is directly concatenated into the string passed to `system`, an attacker can inject malicious commands that the shell will then execute."
Describe a normal case scenario for the `display_file` function.,"In a normal case for the `display_file` function, a client sets the `filename` variable, for example, to `hello.txt`. The function then constructs a command like `cat hello.txt` using `snprintf` and executes it via `system(cmd)`, resulting in the content of `hello.txt` being displayed."
How can an attacker compromise the `display_file` function using command injection?,"An attacker can compromise the `display_file` function by setting the `filename` input to a string like `hello.txt; rm -rf /`. When this input is processed, the command constructed becomes `cat hello.txt; rm -rf /`. The `system` command then executes both `cat hello.txt` and the malicious `rm -rf /` command, leading to the deletion of files the script has permission to remove."
What is the impact of a successful command injection attack in the `display_file` example?,"The impact of a successful command injection attack in the `display_file` example is that after displaying the intended file, `hello.txt`, all files that the script has permission to delete on the system are deleted due to the injected `rm -rf /` command."
What are the general defenses against Command Injection?,"General defenses against Command Injection include avoiding shell commands, using more secure APIs, implementing input inspection, and dropping privileges for processes."
How does avoiding shell commands help prevent Command Injection?,"Avoiding shell commands helps prevent Command Injection by removing the primary vector through which injected commands are executed. If an application does not directly invoke a shell to execute user-supplied strings, the opportunity for an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands is significantly reduced."
What secure APIs can be used to prevent Command Injection?,"To prevent Command Injection, more secure APIs can be used. For Python, `subprocess.run()` is recommended. For C, `execve()` is a more secure alternative. These APIs typically execute commands directly without involving a shell, or provide mechanisms to safely pass arguments, thus preventing command concatenation."
Explain input inspection as a defense against Command Injection.,"Input inspection is a defense against Command Injection that involves carefully examining and processing user input before it is used in commands. This includes sanitization, validation, and whitelisting to ensure that only safe and expected input is processed."
What is sanitization in the context of input inspection for Command Injection?,"Sanitization in the context of input inspection for Command Injection involves escaping dangerous characters within user input. This process modifies or removes characters that could be interpreted as command separators or special shell characters, thereby neutralizing their malicious intent."
What is validation in the context of input inspection for Command Injection?,Validation in the context of input inspection for Command Injection means checking user input against predefined rules or patterns and rejecting any input that is malformed or does not conform to the expected format. This prevents unexpected or potentially malicious input from being processed.
What is whitelisting as a defense against Command Injection?,"Whitelisting as a defense against Command Injection is an input inspection technique where only values from a predefined list of allowed values are accepted. Any input that does not match an entry on the whitelist is rejected, effectively preventing the injection of unauthorized commands or data."
How does dropping privileges help defend against Command Injection?,"Dropping privileges helps defend against Command Injection by limiting the potential damage an attacker can cause. By running processes as non-root users, even if an attacker successfully injects and executes a command, the command will only have the limited permissions of the non-root user, preventing system-wide compromise."
What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?,"Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used for managing data in a database. It provides commands for tasks such as obtaining, adding, updating, and deleting records."
What is the basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records?,"The basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records involves the `SELECT` statement. Examples include `SELECT name FROM Accounts` to retrieve names from the Accounts table, or `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'` to retrieve all columns for records where the name is 'Alice'."
How do you add or update data in a SQL table?,"To add data to a SQL table, you use the `INSERT INTO` statement, for example: `INSERT INTO Accounts (name, age, password) VALUES ('Charlie', 32, 'efgh')`. To update existing data, you use the `UPDATE` statement, for example: `UPDATE Accounts SET password='hello' WHERE name= 'Alice'`."
How do you delete records or an entire table in SQL?,"To delete a set of records from a SQL table, you use the `DELETE FROM` statement with a `WHERE` clause, such as `DELETE FROM Accounts WHERE age >= 30`. To delete the entire table, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement, for example: `DROP TABLE Accounts`."
What are some other syntax characters used in SQL?,"Other syntax characters used in SQL include `--` for single-line comments, and `;` to separate different statements."
What is a single-line comment in SQL?,A single-line comment in SQL is denoted by `--`. Any text following these characters on the same line is ignored by the SQL parser and is used for explanatory purposes within the code.
How are different statements separated in SQL?,"Different statements in SQL are typically separated by a semicolon (`;`). This character indicates the end of one SQL command and the beginning of another, allowing multiple commands to be executed sequentially."
What is SQL Injection?,"SQL Injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It typically involves injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, which then gets executed by the database, allowing the attacker to bypass security measures, retrieve sensitive data, or even modify/delete database content."
Describe a normal case for an SQL query involving a user-provided name.,"In a normal case for an SQL query involving a user-provided name, a user sets a variable, for example, `$name=Bob`. The application then constructs and executes a query like `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Bob'`, which retrieves all records from the Accounts table where the name column matches 'Bob'."
How can an attacker use `OR 1=1` to compromise an SQL query?,"An attacker can use `OR 1=1` to compromise an SQL query by setting the `$name` input to `' OR 1=1 --`. This transforms the original query, such as `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'`, into `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '' OR 1=1 --`. Since `1=1` is always true, the `WHERE` clause becomes true for all records, and the `--` comments out the rest of the original query, leading to the selection and display of the entire client database."
What is the effect of an `OR 1=1` SQL injection?,"The effect of an `OR 1=1` SQL injection is that the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query always evaluates to true. This causes the database to select and display the entire table or database that the query is targeting, effectively bypassing any intended filtering based on user input."
How can an attacker delete an entire table using SQL injection?,"An attacker can delete an entire table using SQL injection by setting the `$name` input to `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --`. This injects a new SQL statement, `DROP TABLE Accounts`, which is executed alongside the original query. The `--` then comments out any remaining part of the original query, leading to the deletion of the entire Accounts table."
What is the impact of an SQL injection that deletes an entire table?,"The impact of an SQL injection that deletes an entire table is catastrophic data loss. The entire table, including all its records and structure, is permanently removed from the database, leading to severe operational disruption and potential data recovery challenges."
Provide an example of a real-world SQL injection attack involving CardSystems.,"In 2007, CardSystems, a major credit card processing company, suffered a real-world SQL injection attack. This breach resulted in the stealing of 263,000 accounts and 43 million credit cards."
Describe the SQL injection attack against the Turkish government.,"In 2014, the Turkish government experienced an SQL injection attack. This attack led to the breach of a government website and the erasure of debt owed to government agencies."
What was the impact of the SQL injection attack on Cisco?,"In 2018, Cisco was affected by an SQL injection attack that allowed attackers to gain shell access to their systems."
What happened in the 7-Eleven SQL injection attack?,"In 2013, 7-Eleven was subjected to an SQL injection attack that resulted in the stealing of 130 million credit card numbers."
How was Tesla affected by an SQL injection attack?,"In 2014, Tesla was affected by an SQL injection attack that breached their website, allowed attackers to gain administrative privileges, and resulted in the theft of user data."
What kind of data was accessed in the Fortnite SQL injection attack?,"In 2019, an SQL injection attack on Fortnite, an online game with over 350 million users, allowed attackers to access user data."
What are the general defenses against SQL Injection?,"General defenses against SQL Injection include using parametrized queries, employing an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and implementing input inspection."
How do parametrized queries defend against SQL Injection?,"Parametrized queries defend against SQL Injection by ensuring that user input is treated strictly as data and not as part of the command itself. For example, `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))` separates the SQL command structure from the user-provided `name` value, preventing malicious code from being interpreted as part of the query logic."
What is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and how does it help prevent SQL Injection?,"An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a programming technique that abstracts SQL generation, allowing developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm rather than raw SQL. ORMs help prevent SQL Injection by automatically generating properly escaped and parametrized SQL queries, significantly reducing the risk of injection vulnerabilities by treating all user-supplied values as data rather than executable code."
Explain input inspection as a defense against SQL Injection.,"Input inspection as a defense against SQL Injection involves scrutinizing user input before it is incorporated into SQL queries. This includes sanitization to escape dangerous characters, validation to reject malformed input, and whitelisting to ensure only allowed values are processed, thereby preventing malicious SQL code from being executed."
What is sanitization in the context of SQL input inspection?,"Sanitization in the context of SQL input inspection involves escaping dangerous characters within user input. This process modifies or removes characters that could be interpreted as SQL syntax, such as single quotes or semicolons, thereby neutralizing their ability to alter the intended query."
What is validation in the context of SQL input inspection?,"Validation in the context of SQL input inspection means checking user input against predefined rules or expected data types and formats. Any input that is malformed or does not meet these criteria is rejected, preventing unexpected or potentially malicious SQL fragments from being processed by the database."
What is whitelisting as a defense against SQL Injection?,"Whitelisting as a defense against SQL Injection is an input inspection technique where only values from a predefined, explicitly allowed set are accepted for use in SQL queries. Any input not on this whitelist is rejected, ensuring that only safe and expected data interacts with the database."
What is JavaScript?,"JavaScript is a programming language specifically designed for web applications. It is executed by the client's browser after being sent from the server, and its primary role is to make websites more interactive."
How does JavaScript function in web applications?,"In web applications, JavaScript functions by being sent from the server to the client's browser. The browser then executes this JavaScript code, which allows for dynamic content, interactive elements, and an overall more engaging user experience on the website."
How can JavaScript be directly embedded in HTML?,JavaScript can be directly embedded in HTML using the `<script>` tag. Any JavaScript code placed between the opening `<script>` and closing `</script>` tags within an HTML document will be executed by the web browser when the page loads.
Provide an example of JavaScript embedded in HTML using the `<script>` tag.,An example of JavaScript embedded in HTML using the `<script>` tag is:\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n<script>alert(Date())</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nThis code would display an alert box in the browser showing the current date and time.
What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?,"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject client-side scripts, such as JavaScript, into web pages viewed by other users. The document provides an example of JavaScript being embedded in HTML, which is the mechanism XSS attacks leverage to execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser."
What are high-level programming languages?,"High-level programming languages are programming languages that are considered to be more abstract and user-friendly, often resembling human language, compared to low-level languages. Scripting languages are referred to as very high-level programming languages, indicating their high level of abstraction and ease of use."
What is a domain-specific language?,"A domain-specific language is a programming language tailored for a particular application domain or environment, rather than being a general-purpose language. Scripting languages, such as Bash or Python, are viewed as domain-specific languages for their respective environments, and SQL is a domain-specific language for managing data in a database."
What is the purpose of `snprintf` in the `display_file` function?,"In the `display_file` function, `snprintf` is used to safely format and store a string into a buffer. Specifically, it constructs the command string, such as `""cat %s""`, by substituting `%s` with the `filename` provided, ensuring that the buffer `cmd` does not overflow by respecting `sizeof(cmd)`."
How does `execve()` in C prevent command injection compared to `system()`?,"`execve()` in C is a more secure API compared to `system()` for preventing command injection because it executes a specified program with a list of arguments, without involving an intermediate shell. This direct execution prevents the interpretation of special shell characters within the arguments, thus eliminating the possibility of injecting additional commands."
What is the role of `subprocess.run()` in Python for security?,"`subprocess.run()` in Python is a more secure API for executing external commands. Its role in security is to prevent command injection by allowing arguments to be passed as a list of strings, which are then directly passed to the operating system without shell interpretation, unlike older methods that might concatenate strings into a shell command."
What does `DBObject` represent in the ORM example?,"In the Object Relational Mapper (ORM) example, `DBObject` represents a base class or interface that defines the fundamental characteristics and behaviors for objects that are mapped to database entities. It serves as the foundation for creating specific database models, such as the `user` class, which inherits its properties and methods for database interaction."
What is the purpose of `Column(String(255))` in an ORM definition?,"In an ORM definition, `Column(String(255))` is used to define a database column that will store string data with a maximum length of 255 characters. It specifies the data type and constraints for a particular attribute of an object, such as `name` or `password`, when mapping it to a database table column."
What is the significance of `alert(Date())` in the XSS example?,"The significance of `alert(Date())` in the XSS example is to demonstrate a simple client-side script that can be injected and executed. `alert()` is a JavaScript function that displays a pop-up box, and `Date()` creates a new Date object, showing the current date and time. This illustrates how an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser."
How does the `WHERE` clause function in SQL?,"The `WHERE` clause in SQL is used to filter records based on a specified condition. It extracts only those records that fulfill the given criteria, allowing for precise data retrieval, as seen in examples like `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'`."
What is the difference between `DELETE FROM` and `DROP TABLE` in SQL?,"`DELETE FROM` in SQL is used to remove specific rows or records from a table based on a `WHERE` clause, while keeping the table structure intact. In contrast, `DROP TABLE` is used to completely remove an entire table from the database, including all its data, indexes, and privileges."
What is the purpose of `sizeof(cmd)` in the `snprintf` function call?,"The purpose of `sizeof(cmd)` in the `snprintf` function call is to specify the maximum number of bytes (including the null terminator) that `snprintf` should write to the `cmd` buffer. This is a crucial security measure to prevent buffer overflows, ensuring that the function does not write beyond the allocated memory for `cmd`."
