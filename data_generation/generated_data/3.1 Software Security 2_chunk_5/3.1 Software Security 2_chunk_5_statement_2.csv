Define scripting languages and explain how they operate.,"Scripting languages are programming languages used to construct commands, also known as scripts, from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime. Once constructed, the script is then passed to another software component where it is executed. These languages are typically viewed as domain-specific languages for a particular environment and are referred to as very high-level programming languages."
Provide examples of common scripting languages.,"Examples of common scripting languages include Bash, PowerShell, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, Safe-Tcl, and JavaScript."
What constitutes a scripting vulnerability?,"A scripting vulnerability arises when an attacker can hide additional malicious commands within the user input. The system, unaware of the malicious nature of these commands, will then execute them, leading to potential compromise."
Explain the role of the 'system' command in the context of command injection.,"In the context of command injection, the `system` command is a function that takes a string as input. It then spawns a shell, which is a command-line interpreter, and executes the provided string as a command within that shell. This behavior is central to how command injection vulnerabilities are exploited."
Describe a normal case scenario for the `display_file` function as presented in the document.,"In a normal case scenario for the `display_file` function, a client sets the `filename` variable to a legitimate file, such as `hello.txt`. The `snprintf` function then constructs a command string like `cat hello.txt`, which is subsequently executed by the `system` command. This results in the content of `hello.txt` being displayed."
Illustrate how command injection can compromise the `display_file` function.,"Command injection can compromise the `display_file` function when an attacker sets the `filename` input to a malicious string, for example, `hello.txt; rm -rf /`. The `snprintf` function will then construct the command `cat hello.txt; rm -rf /`. When this command is passed to `system`, it first displays `hello.txt` and then executes `rm -rf /`, which deletes all files the script has permission to delete, without the system's awareness of the malicious intent."
List the general categories of defenses against command injection.,"The general categories of defenses against command injection include avoiding shell commands, using more secure APIs, implementing input inspection, and dropping privileges."
"How do secure APIs help in defending against command injection, and provide examples?","Secure APIs help defend against command injection by providing safer alternatives to directly executing shell commands. These APIs are designed to handle user input more securely, often by treating it as data rather than executable code. Examples include `subprocess.run()` in Python and `execve()` in C."
Explain the concept of 'Input inspection' as a defense mechanism against command injection.,"Input inspection is a defense mechanism against command injection that involves carefully examining and processing user input before it is used in commands. It includes three main techniques: sanitization, validation, and whitelisting."
Define 'Sanitization' in the context of input inspection for command injection defenses.,"Sanitization, in the context of input inspection for command injection defenses, involves escaping dangerous characters within user input. This process modifies or removes characters that could be interpreted as command separators or special shell commands, thereby neutralizing their malicious potential."
Define 'Validation' as a defense against command injection.,"Validation, as a defense against command injection, involves checking user input against predefined rules or patterns. If the input does not conform to the expected format or content, it is rejected as malformed, preventing potentially malicious commands from being processed."
What is 'Whitelisting' in the context of input inspection for command injection?,"Whitelisting, in the context of input inspection for command injection, is a security practice where only explicitly allowed values or characters are accepted from user input. Any input that is not on the 'whitelist' is rejected, providing a strong defense against unexpected or malicious commands."
How does 'Dropping privileges' contribute to defending against command injection?,"Dropping privileges contributes to defending against command injection by running processes as non-root users. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if a command injection vulnerability is successfully exploited, as the malicious command will execute with restricted permissions, preventing system-wide changes or access to sensitive resources."
Define Structured Query Language (SQL).,"Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used for managing data in a database. It provides commands for various operations such as obtaining, adding, updating, and deleting records."
Provide the basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records.,"The basic SQL syntax for obtaining a set of records includes `SELECT name FROM Accounts` to retrieve specific columns, or `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'` to retrieve all columns for records matching a specific condition."
How do you add or update data in an SQL table using basic syntax?,"To add data, you use `INSERT INTO Accounts (name, age, password) VALUES ('Charlie', 32, 'efgh')`. To update data, you use `UPDATE Accounts SET password='hello' WHERE name= 'Alice'`, which modifies existing records based on a condition."
What is the basic SQL syntax for deleting records or an entire table?,"To delete a set of records, the basic SQL syntax is `DELETE FROM Accounts WHERE age >= 30`. To delete an entire table, the syntax is `DROP TABLE Accounts`."
Explain the purpose of '--' and ';' characters in SQL syntax.,"In SQL syntax, `--` is used to denote single-line comments, meaning any text following `--` on the same line is ignored by the database. The semicolon (`;`) is used to separate different SQL statements, allowing multiple commands to be executed sequentially."
Describe a normal case for an SQL query that requires user input.,"In a normal case for an SQL query requiring user input, a database runs a command like `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= '$name'`. The user client provides the input for `$name`, for example, setting `$name=Bob`. The resulting executed command would be `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Bob'`, which retrieves records for 'Bob'."
Explain the first example of a compromised SQL injection input provided in the document.,"The first example of a compromised SQL injection input involves an attacker setting `$name = ' OR 1=1 --`. When this is injected into `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= '$name'`, the command becomes `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= '' OR 1=1 --`. Since `1=1` is always true, the `WHERE` clause effectively becomes true for all records, leading to the entire client database being selected and displayed."
What is the outcome of the first SQL injection attack shown in the document?,"The outcome of the first SQL injection attack, where the attacker sets `$name = ' OR 1=1 --`, is that the entire client database is selected and displayed. This occurs because the injected `OR 1=1` condition makes the `WHERE` clause always true, bypassing any intended authentication or filtering."
Explain the second example of a compromised SQL injection input provided in the document.,"The second example of a compromised SQL injection input involves an attacker setting `$name = '; DROP TABLE Accounts --`. When this is injected into `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= '$name'`, the command becomes `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= ''; DROP TABLE ACCOUNTS --`. This injects a new statement, `DROP TABLE Accounts`, which deletes the entire 'Accounts' table from the database."
What is the outcome of the second SQL injection attack shown in the document?,"The outcome of the second SQL injection attack, where the attacker sets `$name = '; DROP TABLE Accounts --`, is that a new statement is injected which deletes the entire 'Accounts' table. This demonstrates a severe data loss scenario caused by SQL injection."
Describe the CardSystems SQL injection attack.,"The CardSystems SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2007, targeted a major credit card processing company. This attack resulted in the stealing of 263,000 accounts and 43 million credit cards."
Describe the Turkish government SQL injection attack.,"The Turkish government SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2014, involved breaching a government website. The attackers were able to erase debt owed to government agencies."
Describe the Cisco SQL injection attack.,"The Cisco SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2018, allowed attackers to gain shell access to the affected systems. Shell access provides command-line control over a server."
Describe the 7-Eleven SQL injection attack.,"The 7-Eleven SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2006, resulted in the stealing of 130 million credit card numbers from the company's systems."
Describe the Tesla SQL injection attack.,"The Tesla SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2013, involved breaching the company's website. Attackers were able to gain administrative privileges and steal user data."
Describe the Fortnite SQL injection attack.,"The Fortnite SQL injection attack, which occurred in 2019, targeted an online game with over 350 million users. The attack allowed access to user data."
List the primary defenses against SQL injection.,"The primary defenses against SQL injection include using parameterized queries, employing an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), and implementing input inspection."
Explain 'Parameterized queries' as a defense against SQL injection.,"Parameterized queries are a defense against SQL injection that ensures user input is treated strictly as data, not as part of the command itself. Instead of concatenating user input directly into the SQL string, placeholders are used, and the input is passed separately. This prevents malicious input from altering the query's structure. An example is `cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= ?"", (name))`."
Define 'Object Relational Mapper (ORM)' and its role in preventing SQL injection.,"An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a programming technique that abstracts SQL generation and reduces the risk of injection. It allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, mapping database tables to objects. The ORM handles the underlying SQL generation, often using parameterized queries internally, thereby mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring proper escaping and separation of data from code."
Provide an example of an ORM class definition as shown in the document.,"An example of an ORM class definition is:\n```\nclass user(DBObject) {\n  name = Column(String(255));\n  age = Column(Integer);\n  passsword = Column(String(255));\n}\n```\nThis defines a `user` object with properties like `name`, `age`, and `password`, which would map to columns in a database table."
How does 'Input inspection' apply as a defense against SQL injection?,"Input inspection applies as a defense against SQL injection by scrutinizing user-provided data before it is incorporated into SQL queries. This involves sanitization to escape dangerous characters, validation to reject malformed input, and whitelisting to only accept allowed values, all of which prevent malicious SQL fragments from being executed."
Define JavaScript in the context of web applications.,"JavaScript is a programming language specifically designed for web applications. Its primary function is to make websites more interactive by allowing dynamic content and client-side scripting. The server sends JavaScript code to the client's browser, which then executes it."
How is JavaScript typically embedded within HTML documents?,JavaScript can be directly embedded within HTML documents using the `<script>` tag. Any JavaScript code placed between the opening `<script>` and closing `</script>` tags will be executed by the web browser when the HTML page is loaded.
Provide an example of embedding JavaScript in HTML to display an alert.,"An example of embedding JavaScript in HTML to display an alert is:\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n<script>alert(Date())</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\nThis code will cause a pop-up alert box to appear in the browser, displaying the current date and time when the page is loaded."
What is the purpose of the `alert(Date())` JavaScript function in the provided example?,"In the provided example, the `alert(Date())` JavaScript function is used to display a pop-up dialog box (an 'alert') in the web browser. The `Date()` object in JavaScript returns the current date and time, so the alert box will show the current timestamp to the user."
What are the characteristics of scripting languages?,Scripting languages are characterized by their ability to construct commands (scripts) from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime. The constructed script is then passed to another software component for execution. They are considered domain-specific languages for particular environments and are referred to as very high-level programming languages.
How do scripting vulnerabilities allow attackers to compromise a system?,"Scripting vulnerabilities allow attackers to compromise a system by hiding additional, malicious commands within legitimate user input. The system, unaware of the malicious nature of these hidden commands, proceeds to execute them, leading to unintended and potentially harmful actions."
What is the C code snippet provided for the `display_file` function?,"The C code snippet for the `display_file` function is:\n```c\nvoid display_file(char* filename) {\n  char cmd[512];\n  snprintf(cmd, sizeof(cmd), ""cat %s"", filename);\n  system(cmd);\n}\n```\nThis function takes a filename, constructs a `cat` command using `snprintf`, and then executes it via the `system` call."
What is the purpose of `snprintf` in the `display_file` function?,"In the `display_file` function, `snprintf` is used to safely format and store a string into a buffer. Specifically, it constructs the command string `""cat %s""` by substituting `%s` with the provided `filename`, ensuring that the buffer `cmd` does not overflow by limiting the output to `sizeof(cmd)`."
Provide the SQL command for obtaining all records from the 'Accounts' table where the name is 'Alice'.,The SQL command for obtaining all records from the 'Accounts' table where the name is 'Alice' is `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Alice'`.
Provide the SQL command for inserting a new account for 'Charlie' with age 32 and password 'efgh'.,"The SQL command for inserting a new account for 'Charlie' with age 32 and password 'efgh' is `INSERT INTO Accounts (name, age, password) VALUES ('Charlie', 32, 'efgh')`."
Provide the SQL command for updating the password to 'hello' for the account named 'Alice'.,The SQL command for updating the password to 'hello' for the account named 'Alice' is `UPDATE Accounts SET password='hello' WHERE name= 'Alice'`.
Provide the SQL command for deleting records from the 'Accounts' table where the age is 30 or greater.,The SQL command for deleting records from the 'Accounts' table where the age is 30 or greater is `DELETE FROM Accounts WHERE age >= 30`.
Provide the SQL command for dropping the entire 'Accounts' table.,The SQL command for dropping the entire 'Accounts' table is `DROP TABLE Accounts`.
Provide the SQL command for a normal case where the user input `$name` is 'Bob'.,"For a normal case where the user input `$name` is 'Bob', the SQL command executed would be `SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE name= 'Bob'`."
"Provide the SQL command for the first compromised input example in SQL injection, where `$name` is `' OR 1=1 --`.","For the first compromised input example in SQL injection, where `$name` is `' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting SQL command would be `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= '' OR 1=1 --`."
"Provide the SQL command for the second compromised input example in SQL injection, where `$name` is `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --`.","For the second compromised input example in SQL injection, where `$name` is `'; DROP TABLE Accounts --`, the resulting SQL command would be `SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= ''; DROP TABLE ACCOUNTS --`."
What is the primary function of JavaScript in web applications?,"The primary function of JavaScript in web applications is to make the website more interactive. It achieves this by allowing dynamic content and client-side scripting, where the server sends JavaScript code to the client's browser for execution."
"What is the significance of the `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<script>` tags in the JavaScript embedding example?","In the JavaScript embedding example, `<html>` is the root element of an HTML page. `<body>` contains all the visible content of an HTML document. The `<script>` tag is specifically used to embed or reference executable code, in this case, JavaScript, which is then run by the browser."
