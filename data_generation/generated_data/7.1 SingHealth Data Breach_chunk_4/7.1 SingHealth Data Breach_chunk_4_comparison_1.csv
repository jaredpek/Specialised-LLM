What is the function of the Command & Control (C2) stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,The Command & Control (C2) stage establishes a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim.
"What is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, and what does it entail?","The final stage is Actions on Objectives. With 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals."
When was the first evidence of breach and control establishment over Workstation A observed?,The first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A was observed between August and December 2017.
What did forensic investigations uncover regarding callbacks to a command and control server?,"Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (referred to as a ""C2 server"") starting from 23 August 2017."
Define 'callbacks' in the context of malware and C2 servers.,Callbacks refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used to either fetch updates and instructions for the malware or to send back stolen information to the server.
What malicious artefacts were discovered on Workstation A by the CSA?,"The CSA discovered many malicious artefacts on Workstation A, including a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1""."
What capability did the log file found on Workstation A possess?,The log file found on Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware that had password dumping capability.
What capabilities did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,A publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after an email account has been breached and its password subsequently changed.
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool allows an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on user email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
Compare 'footholds' and 'backdoors' in the context of an attacker's actions.,"Footholds and backdoors are mechanisms established by an attacker to maintain access to a system. Footholds represent initial points of entry, while backdoors provide covert or persistent access, often allowing the attacker to regain entry even if initial access methods are discovered and removed."
What is the significance of an 'extensive command and control network' for an attacker?,"An extensive command and control network is significant for an attacker as it facilitates the management and manipulation of compromised systems. It allows for the issuance of commands, reception of data, and coordination of activities across multiple compromised assets, supporting persistent operations and complex attacks."
Explain the concept of 'impregnable' cyber defenses.,"'Impregnable' cyber defenses refer to security systems that are completely impenetrable and cannot be breached by any attacker, regardless of their resources or sophistication. The document suggests that such defenses are unattainable."
What does it mean for an attacker's success to be 'not inevitable'?,"When an attacker's success is described as 'not inevitable,' it implies that despite the attacker's efforts and capabilities, there are still opportunities for defense mechanisms and actions to thwart their objectives. It suggests that successful defense is possible and depends on the effectiveness of security measures and responses."
What is the purpose of 'phishing' detection training?,"The purpose of phishing detection training is to equip staff with the knowledge and skills to identify and avoid phishing attempts, which are malicious attempts to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication."
Why is regulating 'remote access' important for priced assets?,Regulating remote access is important for priced assets to prevent unauthorized access when users are outside the company's network. This helps protect sensitive data and systems from potential threats originating from less secure external environments.
What is the security implication of '2FA' not being bypassable on important servers?,"Ensuring that 2FA is not bypassable on important servers significantly enhances security. It means that even if an attacker obtains a user's primary authentication credential (like a password), they cannot gain access without the second factor of authentication, thereby preventing unauthorized entry."
Why is it stated that 'we cannot rely on users to do so' regarding patching coding vulnerabilities?,"It is stated that 'we cannot rely on users to do so' regarding patching coding vulnerabilities because users may lack the technical expertise, awareness, or motivation to identify and fix such issues promptly. Centralized and professional management of patching is necessary to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed effectively and in a timely manner."
What is the role of 'enforcement' in a strong password policy?,"Enforcement in a strong password policy ensures that users adhere to the defined rules for password complexity, length, and change frequency. It involves mechanisms to verify compliance and potentially penalize non-compliance, thereby strengthening overall password security."
What is the benefit of fixing 'vulnerabilities highlighted in pen-tests' immediately?,"Fixing vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests immediately is crucial because these tests identify weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Prompt remediation closes these security gaps before they can be leveraged for malicious purposes, thereby reducing the risk of a breach."
How does removing 'inactive email accounts' reduce the attack surface area?,"Removing inactive email accounts reduces the attack surface area by eliminating potential entry points for attackers. Inactive accounts may have weaker passwords or be overlooked in security updates, making them easier targets. Deleting them removes these vulnerabilities from the system."
What is 'reconnaissance' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Reconnaissance, in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain, is the initial phase where an adversary gathers information about the target. This can include collecting details like email addresses and conference information to plan subsequent attack steps."
What is 'weaponization' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Weaponization, within the Cyber Kill Chain, is the process of creating a malicious payload. This typically involves combining an exploit (a piece of code that takes advantage of a software vulnerability) with a backdoor (a method for covert access) to form a deliverable package for the attack."
What is 'delivery' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Delivery, in the Cyber Kill Chain, refers to the method by which the weaponized payload is transmitted to the target. Common delivery mechanisms include email attachments, malicious websites, or infected USB drives."
What is 'exploitation' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Exploitation, in the Cyber Kill Chain, is the stage where the adversary leverages a vulnerability on the target system to execute their malicious code. This is the point where the weaponized payload is activated."
What is 'installation' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Installation, within the Cyber Kill Chain, is the phase where the attacker installs malware onto the compromised asset. This malware can range from backdoors to tools that facilitate further malicious activities."
What is 'command and control (C2)' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Command and Control (C2), in the Cyber Kill Chain, establishes a communication channel between the attacker and the compromised system. This channel allows the attacker to remotely control the infected machine, issue commands, and receive data."
What are 'actions on objectives' in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where the attacker, having achieved 'hands-on-keyboard' access, proceeds to accomplish their ultimate goals. This could involve data theft, system disruption, or other malicious activities."
What is a 'customised Remote Access Trojan (RAT)'?,"A customized Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware specifically designed to provide an attacker with remote access and control over a victim's computer. 'Customized' implies it was tailored for a specific purpose or target, and 'Trojan' refers to its deceptive nature, often appearing as legitimate software."
What is the function of a 'shell script' in the context of remote execution?,"A shell script, when executed remotely by an attacker, allows them to automate and execute a series of commands on the victim's system. This can include tasks like file manipulation, system configuration changes, or launching other malicious programs."
How can a 'publicly available hacking tool' be used to maintain a persistent presence?,"A publicly available hacking tool can be used to maintain a persistent presence by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow continuous access, even if security measures like password changes are implemented. It can act as a backdoor or provide ongoing remote access capabilities."
What are 'mail exchange servers' and how might an attacker interact with them?,"Mail exchange servers (MX servers) are responsible for handling email traffic for a domain. An attacker might interact with them remotely using a hacking tool to intercept, redirect, or manipulate email communications, or to gather information related to email accounts."
Explain 'brute force attacks' on email account passwords.,"Brute force attacks on email account passwords involve systematically trying a large number of possible passwords until the correct one is found. This is often done using automated tools, and a hacking tool can facilitate such attacks by interacting with the mail exchange servers."
