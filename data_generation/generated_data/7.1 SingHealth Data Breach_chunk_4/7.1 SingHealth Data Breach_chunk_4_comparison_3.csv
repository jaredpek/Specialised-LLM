What are the differences between persistence and being well-resourced for an attacker?,"An attacker being **persistent** means they have established multiple footholds and backdoors, and carried out their attack over an extended period, often making multiple attempts to access systems using various methods. In contrast, an attacker being **well-resourced** implies they are part of a group with an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
Explain the concept of persistence in the context of cyber attacks.,"Persistence in the context of cyber attacks refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a compromised system or network over an extended period. This is achieved by establishing multiple footholds and backdoors, and often involves repeated attempts to access target systems using diverse methods. The attacker's actions are carried out over a significant duration, indicating a sustained effort to remain within the compromised environment."
Describe what it means for an attacker to be well-resourced.,"An attacker being well-resourced signifies that they belong to a group possessing substantial capabilities. This includes having an extensive command and control network, which facilitates communication and management of compromised systems. Furthermore, a well-resourced attacker has the capacity to develop a variety of customized tools tailored to their specific attack objectives. They also possess a broad spectrum of technical expertise, enabling them to execute complex operations and adapt to defensive measures."
What is the significance of the attacker being persistent?,"The significance of an attacker being persistent lies in their ability to maintain access and control over compromised systems for an extended duration. This persistence is demonstrated by the establishment of multiple footholds and backdoors, allowing them to bypass initial defenses and re-enter the system. The attacker's sustained efforts over a period of more than 10 months, coupled with multiple attempts to access the SCM database using various methods, highlight the depth of their commitment and the potential for ongoing damage or data exfiltration."
How does being well-resourced benefit an attacker?,"Being well-resourced benefits an attacker by providing them with the necessary infrastructure and capabilities to conduct sophisticated and prolonged attacks. An extensive command and control network allows for efficient management of compromised assets and coordinated operations. The ability to develop numerous customized tools means attackers can create bespoke solutions for specific vulnerabilities or targets, increasing their effectiveness. A wide range of technical expertise enables them to overcome complex security measures and adapt their tactics as needed."
Compare the attacker's persistence with their resourcefulness.,"An attacker's **persistence** is characterized by their sustained effort and ability to maintain access over time, demonstrated by establishing multiple footholds and backdoors and making repeated attempts to breach systems. **Resourcefulness**, on the other hand, refers to the attacker's capabilities, such as having an extensive command and control network, the ability to develop custom tools, and a broad range of technical expertise. While persistence focuses on the duration and continuity of the attack, resourcefulness highlights the means and skills employed."
What does it mean for cyber defenses to be 'never impregnable'?,"The phrase 'never impregnable' implies that cyber defenses, no matter how robust, cannot offer absolute and complete security against all possible threats. It acknowledges that there is always a potential for sophisticated attackers, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), to find ways to breach network perimeters. This suggests that while defenses can be strong and effective, they are not infallible and require continuous improvement and vigilance."
Explain the concept of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a sophisticated and prolonged cyberattack, typically carried out by well-resourced and highly skilled adversaries. APTs are characterized by their stealthy nature, their ability to maintain access to a target network for an extended period, and their focus on achieving specific objectives, such as espionage or data theft. Breaching the perimeter of a network is a common objective for APTs, and it can be difficult to prevent their initial entry."
What is the implication of cyber defenses not being impregnable?,"The implication of cyber defenses not being impregnable is that organizations must accept the possibility of a breach occurring. While strong defenses are crucial for preventing and detecting attacks, they cannot guarantee complete immunity. This necessitates a focus on not only strengthening defenses but also on developing robust incident response capabilities to minimize the impact of a successful breach and to ensure that the attacker's success in achieving their objectives is not inevitable."
How does the success of an attacker relate to the impregnability of cyber defenses?,"The success of an attacker is inversely related to the impregnability of cyber defenses. While it may be difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the perimeter of a network, the ultimate success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data is not inevitable. This means that even if defenses are not completely impregnable, effective measures can still be in place to thwart the attacker's final objectives, such as data theft."
What does it mean for the success of an attacker to be 'not inevitable'?,"The statement that the 'success of the attacker was not inevitable' means that despite the attacker's efforts and potential breaches, their ultimate goals were not guaranteed to be achieved. This implies that there were countermeasures, detection mechanisms, or response actions that prevented the attacker from fully accomplishing their objectives, such as exfiltrating data. It highlights that even in the face of a breach, an organization can still mitigate the impact and prevent the attacker from realizing their full mission."
What are the key components of the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework?,"The 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, outlines the stages an adversary must complete to achieve their objectives. The stages are: 1. Reconnaissance (gathering information), 2. Weaponization (creating a deliverable payload), 3. Delivery (transmitting the weaponized bundle), 4. Exploitation (exploiting a vulnerability), 5. Installation (installing malware), 6. Command & Control (C2) (establishing a command channel), and 7. Actions on Objectives (accomplishing the final goals)."
Describe the Reconnaissance stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The Reconnaissance stage is the first step in the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework. During this phase, adversaries focus on gathering information about their target. This can include harvesting email addresses, collecting conference information, and other open-source intelligence gathering activities. The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and plan the subsequent stages of the attack."
Explain the Weaponization stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The Weaponization stage is the second step in the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain. In this phase, the adversary couples an exploit, which is a piece of code designed to take advantage of a software vulnerability, with a backdoor. A backdoor is a method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system. The result of this coupling is a deliverable payload, which is the malicious package intended to compromise the target system."
What happens during the Delivery stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The Delivery stage is the third step in the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain. In this phase, the weaponized bundle, created during the previous stage, is delivered to the victim. This delivery can occur through various methods, including email, web downloads, or physical media such as USB drives. The objective is to get the malicious payload onto the target system or into the hands of a user who will inadvertently execute it."
Describe the Exploitation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The Exploitation stage is the fourth step in the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain. During this phase, the adversary exploits a vulnerability on the target system to execute code. This means they leverage a weakness in software or hardware to gain unauthorized control or perform malicious actions. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to move forward with their attack objectives."
What is the purpose of the Installation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The Installation stage is the fifth step in the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain. In this phase, the attacker installs malware on the compromised asset. This malware can take various forms, such as backdoors, Trojans, or other malicious software, designed to provide the attacker with continued access and control over the system. Installation ensures the attacker's presence is established on the target."
Explain the Command & Control (C2) stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The Command & Control (C2) stage is the sixth step in the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain. This stage involves establishing a command channel that allows the attacker to remotely manipulate the victim's system. Through this channel, the attacker can send instructions, receive stolen data, and manage the compromised assets, effectively controlling the victim's environment from a distance."
What are 'Actions on Objectives' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives is the seventh and final stage of the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain. Once the attacker has established 'hands-on-keyboard' access and control over the compromised system, they proceed to accomplish their original objectives. This could involve various malicious activities such as data exfiltration, disruption of services, espionage, or financial gain, depending on the attacker's motivations."
How does the Cyber Kill Chain framework help in understanding attacker TTPs?,"The Cyber Kill Chain framework facilitates understanding of an attacker's actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by providing a structured model of their attack progression. By mapping observed activities to the seven stages of the kill chain, security professionals can identify at which point the attacker is in their operation, anticipate their next moves, and develop more effective defensive and detection strategies tailored to each stage."
What are 'TTPs' in the context of cybersecurity?,"TTPs stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures in the context of cybersecurity. Tactics are the high-level goals or objectives of an adversary. Techniques are the specific methods used to achieve those tactics. Procedures are the detailed, step-by-step implementations of those techniques. Understanding an attacker's TTPs is crucial for developing effective defenses and incident response plans."
What is the significance of 'callbacks' in forensic investigations?,"Callbacks are significant in forensic investigations as they provide evidence of communication between compromised systems and external command and control (C2) servers. Uncovering signs of callbacks, such as those directed to an overseas C2 server, indicates that a breach has occurred and that the attacker has established control. These callbacks are communications initiated by malware to fetch updates, receive instructions, or send back stolen information."
Define 'C2 server'.,"A 'C2 server', or Command and Control server, is a remote server used by attackers to communicate with and manage compromised systems or malware. It acts as a central hub from which attackers can issue commands, send instructions, receive stolen data, and maintain control over the infected environment. Evidence of callbacks to a C2 server is a strong indicator of a cyberattack."
What is the purpose of callbacks between malware and C2 servers?,"Callbacks between malware and C2 servers serve two primary purposes: to fetch updates and instructions for the malware, and to send back stolen information from the compromised system to the attacker. These communications are essential for the attacker to maintain control, direct the malware's actions, and exfiltrate sensitive data."
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A?,"In Workstation A, several malicious artefacts were discovered. These included a log file that was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'. These artefacts provided evidence of the attacker's presence and capabilities within the system."
Describe the function of the log file found in Workstation A.,"The log file discovered in Workstation A was identified as a remnant file from a known malware set. This particular malware possessed a password dumping capability, meaning it was designed to extract user credentials from the compromised system. The presence of this log file indicated that the attacker had deployed malware capable of stealing sensitive login information."
What is a 'customised Remote Access Trojan' (RAT)?,"A 'customised Remote Access Trojan' (RAT) is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to remotely access and control a victim's computer. Unlike generic RATs, a customized RAT is specifically tailored by the attacker to suit their particular needs and objectives. In this case, 'RAT 1' provided the attacker with the capability to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
What capabilities did 'RAT 1' provide to the attacker?,"'RAT 1', a customized Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform critical functions remotely, including executing shell scripts, which are automated command sequences, and uploading and downloading files to and from the compromised system."
How can a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain a persistent presence?,"A publicly available hacking tool can help an attacker maintain a persistent presence by enabling them to sustain access to a breached email account, even if the account's password is subsequently changed. This means that once an initial breach occurs, the tool can be used to bypass subsequent security measures, ensuring the attacker can continue to access the system or network."
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"An attacker using a hacking tool can perform several actions. They can interact remotely with mail exchange servers, which are critical for email communication. They can also perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password to gain unauthorized access. Furthermore, the hacking tool can serve as a hidden backdoor, allowing the attacker to regain entry into the system if their initial implants are removed."
Explain how a hacking tool can act as a 'hidden backdoor'.,"A hacking tool can act as a 'hidden backdoor' by providing the attacker with a covert and persistent means of re-entering a compromised system. Even if the initial methods of access or malware implants are detected and removed by security measures, the backdoor established by the hacking tool allows the attacker to bypass normal authentication processes and regain control of the system."
"What is the purpose of regulating internet connections to priced assets, especially remote access?","Regulating internet connections to priced assets, particularly remote access, is crucial for security. It means controlling and monitoring how these valuable assets are accessed, especially when users are outside the company's network. This regulation helps prevent unauthorized access and reduces the risk of breaches that could occur through unsecured remote connections."
Why is it important to have 2FA for access to important servers?,"It is important to have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for access to important servers to enhance security. 2FA requires users to provide two different forms of identification before granting access, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain entry. This measure prevents unauthorized access even if one factor, such as a password, is compromised, and ensures that access cannot be bypassed."
What does it mean for access to important servers to 'not be by-passible'?,"For access to important servers to 'not be by-passible' means that security controls, such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), must be strictly enforced and cannot be circumvented. Attackers should not be able to bypass these security measures to gain unauthorized access. This emphasizes the need for robust implementation and monitoring of access controls to protect sensitive systems."
Why should coding vulnerabilities in applications be patched ASAP?,"Coding vulnerabilities in applications must be patched as soon as possible (ASAP) because they represent weaknesses that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. Relying on users to report or fix these vulnerabilities is insufficient, as users may not have the technical expertise or awareness to do so. Prompt patching closes these security gaps before they can be exploited."
What is the role of a strong password policy and enforcement?,"A strong password policy and its enforcement are critical for cybersecurity. A strong policy typically dictates requirements for password complexity, length, and regular changes. Enforcement ensures that users adhere to these policies, preventing the use of weak or easily guessable passwords. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access through credential compromise."
Why are vulnerabilities highlighted in pen-tests important to fix immediately?,"Vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests (pen-tests) are critical to fix immediately because they represent known weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Pen-tests simulate real-world attacks to identify security flaws. If these identified vulnerabilities are not addressed promptly, they become easy targets for malicious actors, potentially leading to a breach."
What is the purpose of removing inactive email accounts?,"Removing inactive email accounts immediately serves to reduce the attack surface area of an organization. Inactive accounts can become neglected and may contain outdated security configurations or weak passwords, making them vulnerable to compromise. By removing them, the number of potential entry points for attackers is decreased, thereby enhancing overall security."
What is an 'attack surface area' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, the 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all the different points (or vectors) where an unauthorized user (an attacker) can try to enter, interact with, or extract data from an environment. This includes all internet-connected systems, applications, devices, and user accounts. Reducing the attack surface area means minimizing the number of potential vulnerabilities that attackers can target."
Compare 'persistence' with 'establishing footholds and backdoors'.,"**Persistence** refers to an attacker's ability to maintain access to a system over time. **Establishing footholds and backdoors** are the specific methods used to achieve this persistence. A foothold is an initial point of entry, while a backdoor is a hidden method that allows the attacker to bypass normal security controls and re-enter the system, thus enabling their continued presence and persistence."
What is the difference between 'customised tools' and 'publicly available hacking tools' for an attacker?,"'Customised tools' are developed by the attacker specifically for a particular target or objective, offering tailored functionality and potentially greater effectiveness. 'Publicly available hacking tools', on the other hand, are pre-existing tools that can be downloaded and used by anyone. While they offer convenience, they are often less sophisticated and more easily detected by security measures compared to customized tools."
How do 'callbacks' and 'C2 servers' relate to each other?,"'Callbacks' are the communications initiated from a compromised system (where malware is present) back to a 'C2 server' (Command and Control server). The C2 server is controlled by the attacker and acts as a central point to manage the compromised system. Therefore, callbacks are the mechanism through which the malware on the victim's system communicates with the attacker's C2 server."
What is the relationship between 'malware' and 'RAT 1'?,"'RAT 1' is a specific type of 'malware', categorized as a customized Remote Access Trojan. Malware is a broad term for any software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. RAT 1, being a RAT, is a form of malware that grants attackers remote access and control over the infected system, enabling them to perform various malicious actions."
Explain the connection between 'hacking tool' and 'hidden backdoor'.,"A 'hacking tool' can be utilized by an attacker to create or establish a 'hidden backdoor' within a compromised system. The hacking tool provides the functionality to bypass security measures and create a covert channel for future access. This backdoor then allows the attacker to regain entry into the system, even if their initial access methods are detected and removed."
What is the difference between 'breaching the perimeter' and 'exfiltrating data'?,"'Breaching the perimeter' refers to the initial act of bypassing an organization's external security defenses to gain access to its internal network. 'Exfiltrating data', on the other hand, is the subsequent act of stealing sensitive information from the compromised network and transferring it to an external location controlled by the attacker. Breaching the perimeter is a prerequisite for data exfiltration in most cases."
How does 'effective training methods' help in preventing cyber attacks?,"Effective training methods, particularly for detecting phishing, are crucial in preventing cyber attacks by educating all staff members. Phishing attacks often rely on tricking users into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links. By training staff to recognize and report phishing attempts, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful social engineering attacks, which are a common entry point for broader breaches."
What are 'priced assets' in the context of cybersecurity?,"'Priced assets' in the context of cybersecurity refer to an organization's most valuable digital resources and systems. These are the assets that hold critical data, support essential business operations, or have significant financial or reputational value. Examples include sensitive databases, intellectual property, financial systems, and critical infrastructure control systems. Protecting these assets is a top priority."
What is the purpose of 'strong passwords policy and enforcement'?,"The purpose of a 'strong passwords policy and enforcement' is to ensure that all users within an organization utilize robust and secure passwords. This policy typically outlines requirements for password complexity, length, and rotation. Enforcement mechanisms ensure that these rules are followed, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access resulting from weak or compromised credentials."
How can 'inactive email accounts' increase an organization's attack surface?,"Inactive email accounts can increase an organization's attack surface because they often become neglected in terms of security updates and monitoring. If these accounts are not properly secured or are left with default credentials, they can serve as an easy entry point for attackers. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to the network or use the account for further malicious activities."
