Define the concept of persistence in the context of cyber attacks.,"Persistence in the context of cyber attacks refers to the attacker's ability to maintain a presence within a compromised system or network over an extended period. This is often achieved through various methods, such as establishing footholds and backdoors, which allow them to regain access even if initial entry points are discovered and removed. A publicly available hacking tool, for instance, can enable an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after a password has been changed."
Explain what footholds and backdoors are in cybersecurity.,"In cybersecurity, a foothold refers to an initial point of access that an attacker establishes within a target system or network. A backdoor is a method or tool that bypasses normal authentication or security controls, allowing an attacker to access a system remotely or maintain access. The attacker in this scenario established multiple footholds and backdoors, contributing to their persistent presence."

Explain the Weaponization stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,The Weaponization stage of the Cyber Kill Chain involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload that can be used in an attack.
What happens during the Delivery stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"During the Delivery stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, the weaponized bundle is delivered to the victim through various means, such as email, web, or USB drives."
Describe the Exploitation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain.,The Exploitation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.
What is the purpose of the Installation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,The Installation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain involves installing malware on the compromised asset.
Explain the Command & Control (C2) stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,The Command & Control (C2) stage of the Cyber Kill Chain establishes a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim by the attacker.
What are 'Actions on Objectives' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives, the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, occurs when intruders, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, accomplish their original objectives."
What is the significance of understanding the Cyber Kill Chain Framework?,"Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain Framework facilitates the comprehension of the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by an attacker during a cyber attack."
What is a 'callback' in the context of a cyber breach?,A 'callback' refers to communications between malware and command and control (C2) servers. These communications are used to either fetch updates and instructions for the malware or to send back stolen information to the attacker.
When was the first evidence of breach and control establishment over Workstation A?,The first evidence of breach and establishment of control over Workstation A was observed from August to December 2017.
What did forensic investigations uncover regarding Workstation A?,"Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) from Workstation A, starting from August 23, 2017."
What is a 'C2 server'?,A 'C2 server' is a command and control server used by attackers to communicate with and manage compromised systems or malware. It is the destination for 'callbacks' from infected machines.
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A by the CSA?,"The CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A, including a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'."
