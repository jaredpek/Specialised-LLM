What does it mean for an attacker to be persistent?,"An attacker is considered persistent if they have established multiple footholds and backdoors. This persistence allows them to carry out their attack over an extended period, often making multiple attempts to access systems using various methods."
How long did the attacker carry out their attack?,The attacker carried out their attack over a period of more than 10 months.
What is a 'foothold' in the context of a cyber attack?,A 'foothold' refers to a point of entry or access that an attacker establishes within a target system or network. It allows them to maintain a presence and potentially expand their access.
What is a 'backdoor' in cybersecurity?,"A 'backdoor' is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system, network, or application. It allows unauthorized access or control, often used by attackers to regain entry after initial access has been compromised or removed."
What characterized the attacker in terms of resources?,"The attacker was a well-resourced group. This included having an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
What is a 'command and control network' in cybersecurity?,"A 'command and control network' (often abbreviated as C2 or C&C) is a system used by attackers to remotely communicate with and control compromised systems or malware. It allows them to issue commands, receive data, and manage their operations."
What does 'customised tools' imply about an attacker?,"The capability to develop 'customised tools' suggests that the attacker possesses advanced technical skills and can create specific software or scripts tailored to their objectives, rather than relying solely on generic or publicly available tools. This indicates a higher level of sophistication and planning."
What is 'technical expertise' in the context of a cyber attacker?,"'Technical expertise' refers to the attacker's knowledge and proficiency in various aspects of cybersecurity, including system vulnerabilities, network protocols, malware development, and exploitation techniques. A wide range of technical expertise implies a broad and deep understanding of offensive and defensive security measures."
Can cyber defenses be completely impregnable?,"No, cyber defenses can never be completely impregnable. While defenses can be robust, it is often difficult to prevent a determined Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) from breaching the network perimeter."
What is an 'Advanced Persistent Threat' (APT)?,"An 'Advanced Persistent Threat' (APT) is a sophisticated and prolonged cyberattack campaign, typically orchestrated by nation-states or highly organized criminal groups. APTs are characterized by their advanced techniques, stealth, and the goal of maintaining long-term access to a target network to steal data or disrupt operations."
Is it inevitable for an attacker to succeed in obtaining and exfiltrating data?,"No, the success of an attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data is not inevitable, even if they manage to breach the network perimeter. While defenses may not be impregnable, the attacker's success is not guaranteed."
What are effective training methods for detecting phishing?,Effective training methods to detect phishing should be conducted for all staff. These methods are often delivered through tutorials.
What is 'phishing'?,"Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data. This is often done through deceptive emails, messages, or websites."
How should internet connections to priced assets be managed?,Internet connections to priced assets must be regulated. This is especially important for remote access when users are outside the company's network.
What is 'remote access' in a corporate network context?,"'Remote access' refers to the ability for users to connect to a company's internal network and resources from outside the physical office environment, typically over the internet. This is often facilitated through VPNs or other secure connection methods."
What security measures are required for important servers?,Access to important servers must have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and should not be bypassible.
What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?,"Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a code from a mobile app or a physical token), or something the user is (like a fingerprint)."
What should be done about coding vulnerabilities in applications?,Any coding vulnerability in the applications used must be patched as soon as possible (ASAP). Reliance should not be placed on users to identify or report these vulnerabilities.
What does 'patched ASAP' mean for software vulnerabilities?,'Patched ASAP' means that software vulnerabilities should be fixed or mitigated with the highest priority and urgency. This involves applying software updates or patches to correct the flaw and prevent exploitation.
What is the recommended policy for passwords?,A strong password policy and enforcement are recommended. This is often reinforced through tutorials.
What are the requirements for vulnerabilities found during penetration tests?,Vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests (pen-tests) must be fixed immediately.
What is a 'penetration test' (pen-test)?,"A 'penetration test' (pen-test) is a simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or web application to evaluate its security. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit."
What action should be taken with inactive email accounts?,Inactive email accounts must be removed immediately. This is done to reduce the attack surface area.
What is an 'attack surface area'?,An 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all the different points (or 'surfaces') where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing this area by removing unnecessary accounts or services limits potential entry points for attackers.
What framework is useful for understanding cyber attacks?,"The 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, is useful for understanding the events of a cyber attack."
What does the Cyber Kill Chain framework identify?,The Cyber Kill Chain framework identifies what adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objectives. It outlines a series of stages that an attacker typically goes through.
How many stages are in the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,The Cyber Kill Chain framework consists of 7 stages.
What are the starting and ending stages of the Cyber Kill Chain?,The Cyber Kill Chain starts with early reconnaissance and concludes with the final goal of data exfiltration.
What is 'reconnaissance' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"'Reconnaissance' is the initial stage of the Cyber Kill Chain where attackers gather information about their target. This can include harvesting email addresses, conference information, and other intelligence."
What is 'data exfiltration' in the context of cyber attacks?,"'Data exfiltration' is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. It is the final objective in many cyber attacks, where attackers steal sensitive information."
How does the Cyber Kill Chain framework help in understanding attacks?,"Having the Cyber Kill Chain framework in mind facilitates understanding of the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an attacker."
What are 'TTPs' in cybersecurity?,"'TTPs' stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. These are the methods and behaviors employed by cyber attackers to achieve their objectives. Understanding TTPs helps in identifying and defending against threats."
What is 'weaponization' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,'Weaponization' in the Cyber Kill Chain involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload. This payload is then used to compromise the target system.
What is an 'exploit' in cybersecurity?,"An 'exploit' is a piece of software, data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur within computer software, hardware, or something electronic (like computer 'smart' logic)."
What is 'delivery' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"'Delivery' in the Cyber Kill Chain is the process of transmitting the weaponized bundle to the victim. This can be done via email, web, USB drives, or other methods."
What is 'exploitation' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,'Exploitation' in the Cyber Kill Chain is the stage where an attacker exploits a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system. This is how they gain initial control or elevate privileges.
What is 'installation' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,'Installation' in the Cyber Kill Chain refers to the act of installing malware on the compromised asset. This malware often includes backdoors or other tools for maintaining access.
What is 'command and control (C2)' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,'Command and control (C2)' in the Cyber Kill Chain establishes a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim. This allows the attacker to communicate with and control the compromised system.
What are 'actions on objectives' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"'Actions on objectives' is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where intruders, with 'hands on keyboard' access, accomplish their original goals, such as data exfiltration or system disruption."
What was the first evidence of breach and control established over Workstation A?,"The first evidence of breach and control over Workstation A was the discovery of signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) starting from August 23, 2017. This period of establishing control lasted from August to December 2017."
What are 'callbacks' in the context of malware?,'Callbacks' refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used by the malware to either fetch updates and instructions from the server or to send back stolen information to the server.
What did forensic investigations uncover regarding Workstation A?,"Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) from August 23, 2017, indicating the establishment of control over Workstation A."
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A?,"CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A, including a log file that was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'."
What is a 'Remote Access Trojan' (RAT)?,"A 'Remote Access Trojan' (RAT) is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to remotely access and control a victim's computer. It often allows for functions like executing commands, accessing files, and monitoring user activity."
What capabilities did 'RAT 1' provide to the attacker?,"'RAT 1' provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
What is a 'shell script'?,"A 'shell script' is a script written for a command-line interpreter (shell). It is a sequence of commands that are executed by the shell. In the context of remote access, attackers can use shell scripts to automate tasks or execute commands on a compromised system."
What is the function of a log file remnant from a malware set?,"A log file that is a remnant from a malware set can contain valuable information about the malware's activity, including its operations, commands received, and data accessed. It may also indicate the presence of password dumping capabilities."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,"A publicly available hacking tool can enable an attacker to maintain a persistent presence in a breached email account, even if the account's password is subsequently changed. This is because the tool can bypass or circumvent standard authentication mechanisms."
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool can allow an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on user email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
What is a 'brute force attack' on passwords?,A 'brute force attack' on passwords is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to guess a password. They systematically try all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. This is often done against email accounts or other login systems.
How can a hacking tool act as a 'hidden backdoor'?,"A hacking tool can act as a 'hidden backdoor' by providing a covert channel for the attacker to re-enter the system. Even if the attacker's initial access methods (implants) are detected and removed, the backdoor allows them to regain access without needing to go through the full initial compromise process again."
