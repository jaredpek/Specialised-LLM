What does it mean for an attacker to be persistent?,"An attacker is considered persistent if they have established multiple footholds and backdoors. This persistence allows them to carry out attacks over extended periods, such as the 10 months mentioned, and to make repeated attempts to access systems like the SCM database using various methods."
What are footholds and backdoors in the context of cyber attacks?,"In the context of cyber attacks, 'footholds' refer to initial points of entry or access that an attacker gains into a system or network. 'Backdoors' are clandestine methods of bypassing normal authentication or security controls to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or encrypted data. The establishment of multiple footholds and backdoors signifies an attacker's persistent presence and ability to maintain access."
How long did the attacker carry out their attack?,The attacker carried out their attack over a period of more than 10 months.
What methods did the attacker use to access the SCM database?,The attacker made multiple attempts to access the SCM database using various methods.
Describe the characteristics of the attacker group.,"The attacker was a well-resourced group. This means they possessed an extensive command and control network, had the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and had a wide range of technical expertise."
What is a command and control network in cybersecurity?,"A command and control (C2) network, in cybersecurity, refers to the infrastructure used by an attacker to remotely communicate with and control compromised systems or malware. An extensive C2 network indicates a sophisticated and well-organized attacker."
What does it mean for an attacker to have customized tools?,"When an attacker has the capability to develop numerous customized tools, it implies they can create specialized software or scripts tailored to their specific attack objectives and the target environment. This level of customization enhances their effectiveness and ability to evade detection."
What is the significance of an attacker having a wide range of technical expertise?,"A wide range of technical expertise means the attacker possesses diverse skills across various domains of cybersecurity, such as network penetration, malware development, social engineering, and system exploitation. This broad skill set allows them to adapt their tactics and overcome different security measures."
Can cyber defenses be completely impregnable?,"No, cyber defenses cannot be completely impregnable. While efforts are made to strengthen defenses, it is acknowledged that they will never be entirely impenetrable."
What is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?,An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a sophisticated and prolonged cyberattack in which an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. APTs are typically carried out by well-resourced and highly skilled attackers who aim to steal data or disrupt operations.
Is it always possible to prevent an APT from breaching a network perimeter?,It may be difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) from breaching the perimeter of a network.
Was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable?,"No, the success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating the data was not inevitable."
What are effective training methods for detecting phishing?,Effective training methods to detect phishing must be conducted to all staff. These are often implemented as tutorials.
What is phishing?,"Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, entices a victim to open an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, or the theft of sensitive information."
How should internet connections to priced assets be managed?,"Internet connections to priced assets must be regulated, with particular attention paid to remote access when users are outside the company's network."
What security measures are required for important servers?,Access to important servers must have two-factor authentication (2FA) and should not be bypassible.
What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?,Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process in which a user must provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. This is typically a password (something the user knows) and a code sent to their phone or generated by an authenticator app (something the user has). It adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
What should be done about coding vulnerabilities in applications?,Any coding vulnerability in the applications used must be patched as soon as possible (ASAP). Reliance should not be placed on users to address these vulnerabilities.
What is a coding vulnerability?,"A coding vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in the source code of a software application that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of the system. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks."
What is the policy regarding passwords?,A strong password policy and enforcement are necessary. These are often implemented through tutorials.
What should be done with vulnerabilities identified in penetration tests?,Vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests (pen-tests) must be fixed immediately.
What are penetration tests?,"Penetration tests, or pen-tests, are authorized simulated cyberattacks on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. They are conducted to identify vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit."
What action is required for inactive email accounts?,Inactive email accounts must be removed immediately to reduce the attack surface area.
What is an attack surface area?,"In cybersecurity, the attack surface area refers to the sum of all the points (the 'surface') where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing the attack surface area involves minimizing the number of potential entry points for attackers, such as by disabling unused accounts or services."
What is the Cyber Kill Chain Framework?,"The Cyber Kill Chain Framework is a model developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the seven stages an adversary must complete to achieve their objectives during a cyberattack. It helps in understanding the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an attacker."
Who developed the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework?,The 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework was developed by Lockheed Martin.
What are the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,The Cyber Kill Chain framework identifies seven stages that adversaries must complete. These stages start from early reconnaissance and go through to the final goal of data exfiltration.
What is reconnaissance in the context of a cyber attack?,"Reconnaissance, in the context of a cyber attack, is the initial stage where an adversary gathers information about the target. This can involve harvesting email addresses, conference information, and other details to plan the attack."
What is data exfiltration?,"Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. It is often the final goal of a cyberattack, where attackers steal sensitive information."
What is the purpose of understanding the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,"Having the Cyber Kill Chain framework in mind facilitates understanding of the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an attacker in a given case."
What are TTPs in cybersecurity?,"TTPs stand for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. In cybersecurity, TTPs describe the patterns of activities or the specific methods and tools that threat actors use to conduct cyberattacks. Understanding TTPs helps in identifying and defending against threats."
What is weaponization in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Weaponization, in the Cyber Kill Chain, involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload. This payload is then used to compromise the target system."
What is an exploit in cybersecurity?,"An exploit is a piece of software, data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur within computer software, hardware, or something electronic (an 'exploit')."
What is a deliverable payload?,"A deliverable payload is the part of a malware or exploit that performs the intended malicious action. In the context of weaponization, it's the package that is delivered to the victim, containing the exploit and backdoor."
What is delivery in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Delivery, in the Cyber Kill Chain, is the stage where the weaponized bundle is transmitted to the victim. This can occur via various methods, including email, web, or USB drives."
What is exploitation in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Exploitation, in the Cyber Kill Chain, involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system. This is the stage where the attacker leverages a weakness to gain control or perform actions."
What is installation in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Installation, in the Cyber Kill Chain, is the stage where malware is installed on the compromised asset. This allows the attacker to maintain a presence and execute further actions."
What is Command & Control (C2) in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Command & Control (C2), in the Cyber Kill Chain, establishes a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim. This allows the attacker to issue commands and control the compromised system."
What are Actions on Objectives in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives, the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, is where intruders, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, accomplish their original objectives. This could involve data theft, disruption, or other malicious goals."
What is 'Hands on Keyboard' access?,"'Hands on Keyboard' access refers to a situation where an attacker has direct, interactive control over a compromised system, as if they were physically operating the keyboard and mouse."
What were the first signs of breach and control established over Workstation A?,"The first evidence of breach and control over Workstation A was indicated by forensic investigations uncovering signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) starting from August 23, 2017. This period of control extended to December 2017."
What are callbacks in cybersecurity?,Callbacks refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used by the malware to either fetch updates and instructions from the server or to send back stolen information to the attacker.
What is an overseas command & control server?,An overseas command & control server (C2 server) is a server located in a different country that an attacker uses to remotely manage and control compromised systems or malware. The use of an overseas server can be an attempt to obscure the attacker's location and make attribution more difficult.
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A?,"CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A. These included a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'."
What is a log file remnant of a malware set?,"A log file remnant of a malware set is a file that remains on a system after malware has been active or has been removed. This log file can contain valuable information about the malware's activities, such as its execution, commands received, or data accessed."
What is a publicly available hacking tool?,"A publicly available hacking tool is a software program or utility that can be accessed and used by anyone, often for legitimate security testing purposes, but can also be misused by attackers to compromise systems. These tools can have various functionalities, such as network scanning, password cracking, or exploiting vulnerabilities."
What is a customized Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A customized Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware designed to give an attacker remote control over a victim's computer. 'Customized' means it was specifically modified or developed for this particular attack, rather than being a generic, off-the-shelf tool. RATs can perform various malicious actions, such as spying on the user, stealing data, or executing commands."
What capability did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
What is a shell script?,"A shell script is a script written for a command-line interpreter, also known as a shell. These scripts are used to automate tasks by issuing a sequence of commands to the operating system. In the context of a cyberattack, attackers can use shell scripts to remotely execute commands on a compromised system."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain a persistent presence?,A publicly available hacking tool can enable an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after an email account has been breached and its password subsequently changed. This is because the tool might have functionalities that bypass or circumvent standard authentication mechanisms.
What malicious activities can a hacking tool facilitate?,"A hacking tool can allow an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on user email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
What is a brute force attack?,"A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to guess credentials, such as passwords or encryption keys. It involves systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found. In the context of email accounts, it means trying numerous password variations to gain access."
What is a hidden backdoor in cybersecurity?,A hidden backdoor is a secret method of bypassing normal security and authentication functions to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or encrypted data. It allows an attacker to re-enter a system even if the initial point of entry or malware has been detected and removed.
