Summarize the persistence of the attacker as described in the document.,The attacker demonstrated persistence by establishing multiple footholds and backdoors. This allowed them to carry out their attack over a period exceeding 10 months and to make repeated attempts to access the SCM database using various methods.
Describe the resources and capabilities of the attacker.,"The attacker was a well-resourced group, possessing an extensive command and control network. They also had the capability to develop numerous customized tools and exhibited a wide range of technical expertise."
Explain the concept of cyber defenses never being impregnable.,"The document states that cyber defenses will never be impregnable, meaning they cannot be completely impenetrable or invulnerable to attack. It also acknowledges that preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) from breaching a network's perimeter can be difficult."
Summarize the inevitability of attacker success in data exfiltration.,"Despite the difficulty in preventing breaches, the success of an attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable. This implies that even if a breach occurs, there are still opportunities to prevent or mitigate the ultimate goal of data theft."
What are the recommended training methods for staff?,Effective training methods must be conducted for all staff to detect phishing. This training is described as a tutorial.
What regulations are needed for internet connections to priced assets?,Internet connections to priced assets must be regulated. This is especially important for remote access when individuals are outside the company's network.
What security measures should be implemented for important servers?,Access to important servers must have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and should not be bypassable. 2FA is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity.
How should coding vulnerabilities be addressed?,Any coding vulnerability in the applications used must be patched as soon as possible (ASAP). It is not advisable to rely on users to address these vulnerabilities.
What is the policy regarding passwords?,A strong password policy and enforcement are necessary. This is also indicated as a tutorial.
What should be done with vulnerabilities identified in penetration tests?,Vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests (pen-tests) and similar assessments must be fixed immediately.
What action is required for inactive email accounts?,"Inactive email accounts must be removed immediately. This action is taken to reduce the attack surface area, which refers to the sum of the different points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment."
Explain the Cyber Kill Chain Framework.,"The Cyber Kill Chain Framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a model that identifies the stages an adversary must complete to achieve their objectives. It outlines 7 stages, starting from early reconnaissance and progressing to the final goal of data exfiltration. Understanding this framework helps in comprehending the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an attacker."
What are the 7 stages of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework?,"The 7 stages of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework are: 1. Reconnaissance (Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.), 2. Weaponization (Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload), 3. Delivery (Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.), 4. Exploitation (Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system), 5. Installation (Installing malware on the asset), 6. Command & Control (C2) (Command channel for remote manipulation of victim), and 7. Actions on Objectives (With 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals)."
What is reconnaissance in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,Reconnaissance is the first stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. It involves harvesting information such as email addresses and conference details to prepare for an attack.
Describe the weaponization stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,Weaponization is the second stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. It involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload.
What happens during the delivery stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The delivery stage, the third in the Cyber Kill Chain, involves delivering the weaponized bundle to the victim through various means such as email, web, or USB drives."
Explain the exploitation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"Exploitation, the fourth stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system."
What is the installation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The installation stage, the fifth in the Cyber Kill Chain, is when malware is installed on the victim's asset."
Define Command & Control (C2) in the Cyber Kill Chain.,Command & Control (C2) is the sixth stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. It establishes a command channel that allows for the remote manipulation of the victim.
What are the actions on objectives in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives is the seventh and final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. At this point, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals."
"What was the first evidence of breach and control establishment, and when did it occur?",The first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A was uncovered through forensic investigations that found signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) starting from 23 August 2017. This period of control establishment extended to December 2017.
Define 'callbacks' in the context of cyber security.,Callbacks refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used either to fetch updates and instructions for the malware or to send back stolen information to the attacker.
What malicious artefacts were discovered on Workstation A?,CSA discovered several malicious artefacts on Workstation A. These included: (i) a log file which was a remnant of a malware set; (ii) a publicly available hacking tool; and (iii) a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'.
What capability did the log file found on Workstation A possess?,The log file found on Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware that possessed password dumping capability. Password dumping is a technique used to extract password hashes or cleartext passwords from a system.
What capabilities did 'RAT 1' provide to the attacker?,"'RAT 1', a customized Remote Access Trojan, provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,"A publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a persistent presence on a compromised system. This persistence is maintained even if the email account password is subsequently changed, as long as the initial breach of the email account has occurred."
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool allows an attacker to perform several actions. These include interacting remotely with mail exchange servers, performing simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serving as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
Summarize the attacker's persistence and duration of the attack.,"The attacker was persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. The attack was carried out over a period of more than 10 months, during which multiple attempts were made to access the SCM database using various methods."
Describe the attacker's resources and technical expertise.,The attacker was a well-resourced group with an extensive command and control network. They possessed the capability to develop numerous customized tools and demonstrated a wide range of technical expertise.
What is the implication of cyber defenses never being impregnable?,"The statement that cyber defenses will never be impregnable means that no security system is completely foolproof. It suggests that while defenses can be strong, they can eventually be overcome, and it may be difficult to prevent sophisticated threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) from breaching network perimeters."
Was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable?,"No, the success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable. This implies that even after a breach, there were potential points where the attack could have been thwarted or its impact minimized."
What is the purpose of effective training methods for staff?,Effective training methods for staff are designed to help them detect phishing attempts. This training is crucial for all employees.
What is the importance of regulating internet connections for priced assets?,"Regulating internet connections to priced assets is important to control access, particularly for remote connections made when users are outside the company's network. This helps to secure valuable resources."
What security measures are required for important servers?,"Important servers must implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for access, and this authentication should not be bypassable. 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring two distinct forms of identification."
What is the recommended approach for handling coding vulnerabilities?,Coding vulnerabilities in applications should be patched as soon as possible (ASAP). Reliance should not be placed on users to identify and fix these issues.
What is the policy regarding password strength?,A strong password policy must be in place and enforced. This includes guidelines for creating and managing passwords to enhance security.
What action should be taken regarding vulnerabilities found during pen-tests?,Any vulnerabilities identified during penetration tests (pen-tests) or similar security assessments must be fixed immediately to prevent exploitation.
Why should inactive email accounts be removed?,Inactive email accounts should be removed immediately to reduce the attack surface area. An attack surface is the sum of the vulnerabilities to which an organization is exposed.
What is the Cyber Kill Chain Framework and who developed it?,"The Cyber Kill Chain Framework is a model developed by Lockheed Martin. It outlines the 7 stages that adversaries must complete to achieve their objectives, starting from reconnaissance to data exfiltration."
What is the primary goal of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework?,"The primary goal of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework is to help understand the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an attacker by breaking down an attack into distinct stages."
What is the initial stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The initial stage of the Cyber Kill Chain is Reconnaissance, which involves gathering information about the target."
What is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain is Actions on Objectives, where the attacker achieves their ultimate goals after gaining 'Hands on Keyboard' access."
What is the role of Command & Control (C2) in the Cyber Kill Chain?,The Command & Control (C2) stage in the Cyber Kill Chain establishes a communication channel that allows the attacker to remotely manipulate the victim's system.
What is the significance of 'callbacks' in the context of the breach?,"Callbacks are significant as they were the first evidence of the breach and the establishment of control. They represent communications between malware and C2 servers, indicating an ongoing connection and potential data transfer or command execution."
What is a 'C2 server'?,"A 'C2 server', or command and control server, is a server used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems. In this context, it was an overseas server to which callbacks were made."
What is a 'customised Remote Access Trojan'?,"A 'customised Remote Access Trojan' (RAT) is a type of malware that is specifically tailored for a particular attack. It provides the attacker with the ability to remotely access and control the infected system, performing actions like executing commands and transferring files."
What is the function of a 'backdoor' in cyber attacks?,"A backdoor serves as a hidden entry point for an attacker to regain access to a system, especially if initial access methods are detected or removed. It bypasses normal authentication procedures."
What does 'persistent presence' mean in the context of a hacking tool?,"'Persistent presence' means that the attacker can maintain access to the system over time, even if security measures like password changes are implemented. The hacking tool facilitates this by allowing continued access."
Explain 'brute force attacks' on email accounts.,Brute force attacks on email accounts involve systematically trying numerous password combinations until the correct one is found. This is a method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
