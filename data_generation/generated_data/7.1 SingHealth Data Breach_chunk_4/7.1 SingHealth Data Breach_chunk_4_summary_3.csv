Explain the Cyber Kill Chain Framework.,"The Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a model that identifies the stages an adversary must complete to achieve their objectives. It consists of 7 stages, starting from early reconnaissance and culminating in data exfiltration. Understanding this framework helps in comprehending the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of an attacker."
What are the 7 stages of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The 7 stages of the Cyber Kill Chain are: 1. Reconnaissance (Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.), 2. Weaponization (Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload), 3. Delivery (Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.), 4. Exploitation (Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system), 5. Installation (Installing malware on the asset), 6. Command & Control (C2) (Command channel for remote manipulation of victim), and 7. Actions on Objectives (With 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals)."
What is meant by 'callbacks' in the context of a cyber breach?,Callbacks refer to communications between malware and Command and Control (C2) servers. These communications are used either to fetch updates and instructions for the malware or to send back stolen information to the attacker.
When was the first evidence of breach and control established over Workstation A?,"The first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017. Specifically, signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) were uncovered from 23 August 2017."
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A?,CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A. These included: (i) a log file which was a remnant of a malware set; (ii) a publicly available hacking tool; and (iii) a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'.
What is the function of the log file found in Workstation A?,The log file found in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware that possessed password dumping capability.
What capabilities did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,A publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after an email account has been breached and its password subsequently changed.
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool allows an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
Summarize the attacker's persistence and duration of the attack.,"The attacker was persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. The attack was carried out over a period of more than 10 months, involving numerous attempts to access the SCM database through various methods."
Describe the attacker's resources and technical capabilities.,The attacker was a well-resourced group with an extensive command and control network. They possessed the ability to develop numerous customized tools and a broad range of technical expertise.
Explain the limitations of cyber defenses against APTs.,"Cyber defenses are not impregnable, meaning they can be breached. It is difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) from breaching a network's perimeter. However, the attacker's success in data acquisition and exfiltration is not guaranteed."
What is the purpose of effective training methods?,Effective training methods are designed to equip all staff with the ability to detect phishing attempts. This is considered a tutorial.
What is the requirement for remote access to priced assets?,"Internet connections to priced assets must be regulated, especially when it comes to remote access utilized by individuals outside the company's network."
What security measures are mandatory for important servers?,Important servers must implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and should be configured to prevent bypass.
What is the recommended approach for handling coding vulnerabilities?,All coding vulnerabilities in used applications must be patched promptly. It is not advisable to rely on users to address these issues.
What is the policy regarding password strength?,A strong password policy must be in place and enforced. This is also categorized as a tutorial.
What action is required for vulnerabilities found during pen-tests?,Vulnerabilities identified during penetration tests (pen-tests) and similar security assessments must be rectified immediately.
How can the attack surface be minimized?,The attack surface area can be reduced by promptly removing inactive email accounts.
What is the Cyber Kill Chain framework and its origin?,"The Cyber Kill Chain framework is a model developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the stages an adversary must complete to achieve their objectives. It comprises 7 stages, beginning with reconnaissance and ending with data exfiltration."
What are the initial stages of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The initial stages of the Cyber Kill Chain include Reconnaissance, which involves harvesting information like email addresses and conference details, and Weaponization, where an exploit is coupled with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload."
Describe the middle stages of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The middle stages of the Cyber Kill Chain involve Delivery, where the weaponized bundle is sent to the victim via email, web, or USB; Exploitation, where a vulnerability is used to execute code on the victim's system; and Installation, where malware is installed on the asset."
What are the final stages of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The final stages of the Cyber Kill Chain are Command & Control (C2), which establishes a command channel for remote manipulation of the victim, and Actions on Objectives, where intruders, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, achieve their original goals."
