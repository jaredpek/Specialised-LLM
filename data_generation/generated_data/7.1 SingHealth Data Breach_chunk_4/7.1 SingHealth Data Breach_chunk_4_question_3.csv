What does it mean for an attacker to be persistent?,"An attacker is considered persistent if they have established multiple footholds and backdoors. This persistence allows them to carry out attacks over extended periods, such as the 10 months mentioned, and to attempt access to systems like the SCM database using various methods."
What are footholds and backdoors in the context of cyber attacks?,"Footholds refer to initial points of entry or access that an attacker gains into a system or network. Backdoors are hidden or secret methods of accessing a system that bypass normal authentication or security measures, allowing the attacker to regain access even if initial entry points are discovered and closed."
How long did the attacker carry out their attack?,The attacker carried out their attack over a period of more than 10 months.
What methods did the attacker use to access the SCM database?,The attacker made multiple attempts to access the SCM database using various methods.
Describe the characteristics of the attacker group.,"The attacker was a well-resourced group. This means they possessed an extensive command and control network, had the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and had a wide range of technical expertise."
What is a command and control network in cybersecurity?,"A command and control (C2) network is a system used by attackers to remotely communicate with and control compromised systems or malware. It allows them to issue commands, receive stolen data, and manage their operations."
What does it mean for an attacker to have customized tools?,"Having customized tools implies that the attacker developed or modified software and techniques specifically for their attack objectives, rather than relying solely on generic or publicly available tools. This suggests a higher level of sophistication and tailored capabilities."
What is the significance of an attacker having a wide range of technical expertise?,"A wide range of technical expertise indicates that the attacker possesses diverse skills across various domains of cybersecurity, such as network intrusion, malware development, social engineering, and system exploitation. This allows them to adapt their tactics and overcome different security measures."
Can cyber defenses be completely impregnable?,"No, cyber defenses cannot be completely impregnable. While they can be robust, it is acknowledged that it may be difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the network perimeter."
What is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a sophisticated and prolonged cyberattack campaign, typically orchestrated by well-resourced and skilled adversaries. APTs aim to gain unauthorized access to a network and remain undetected for an extended period, often to steal sensitive data or disrupt operations."
Was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable?,"No, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable, despite the challenges in preventing breaches."
What are effective training methods for detecting phishing?,Effective training methods to detect phishing must be conducted to all staff. These are often delivered through tutorials.
What is phishing?,"Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, entices a victim to open an email, instant message, or text message, and then click a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system by ransomware, or the theft of sensitive information."
How should internet connections to priced assets be managed?,"Internet connections to priced assets must be regulated, with particular attention paid to remote access when users are outside the company's network."
What security measures are required for important servers?,Access to important servers must have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and should not be bypassible.
What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?,"Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a security token or a code from a mobile app), or something the user is (like a fingerprint)."
What should be done about coding vulnerabilities in applications?,Any coding vulnerability in the applications used must be patched as soon as possible (ASAP). Reliance should not be placed on users to address these vulnerabilities.
What is the recommended policy for passwords?,A strong password policy and enforcement are recommended. This is often covered in tutorials.
What action should be taken regarding vulnerabilities found in penetration tests?,Vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests (pen-tests) and other assessments must be fixed immediately.
What is a penetration test (pen-test)?,"A penetration test, or pen-test, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. It involves attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to identify security weaknesses."
What should be done with inactive email accounts?,Inactive email accounts must be removed immediately to reduce the attack surface area.
What is an attack surface area?,"An attack surface area refers to the sum of all possible points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user (an ""attacker"") can try to enter, interact with, or extract data from an information system. Reducing this area limits the opportunities for attackers."
What framework is useful for understanding cyber attacks?,"The 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, is useful for understanding the events of a cyber attack."
What does the Cyber Kill Chain framework identify?,"The Cyber Kill Chain framework identifies what adversaries must complete to achieve their objectives. It outlines 7 stages, starting from early reconnaissance to the final goal of data exfiltration."
What are the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The Cyber Kill Chain consists of 7 stages: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control (C2), and Actions on Objectives."
What is Reconnaissance in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Reconnaissance is the first stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, involving the harvesting of information such as email addresses and conference information."
What occurs during the Weaponization stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Weaponization is the second stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where an exploit is coupled with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload."
What is the Delivery stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Delivery is the third stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where the weaponized bundle is delivered to the victim via methods such as email, web, or USB."
What is Exploitation in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Exploitation is the fourth stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where a vulnerability is exploited to execute code on the victim's system."
What is the Installation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Installation is the fifth stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where malware is installed on the targeted asset."
What is Command & Control (C2) in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Command & Control (C2) is the sixth stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, establishing a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim."
What are Actions on Objectives in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives is the seventh and final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where intruders, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, accomplish their original objectives."
What is data exfiltration?,Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. It is the final goal in the Cyber Kill Chain framework.
What is the purpose of understanding the attacker's TTPs?,"Understanding the attacker's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) facilitates the comprehension of their actions and methods within the context of a cyber attack."
What is a TTP in cybersecurity?,"A TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. In cybersecurity, TTPs describe the methods and patterns of behavior used by threat actors during cyberattacks."
When was the first evidence of breach and control established over Workstation A?,The first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017.
What did forensic investigations uncover regarding Workstation A?,Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) from 23 August 2017.
What are callbacks in the context of malware?,"Callbacks refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used to either fetch updates and instructions for the malware, or to send back stolen information to the attacker."
What malicious artefacts were discovered on Workstation A?,"CSA discovered several malicious artefacts on Workstation A, including a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as ""RAT 1""."
What capability did the log file found on Workstation A possess?,The log file found on Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware that had password dumping capability.
What is password dumping capability?,Password dumping capability refers to a malware's ability to extract or steal stored passwords from a compromised system. This often involves accessing password hashes or plaintext passwords stored by the operating system or applications.
What capabilities did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that grants an attacker unauthorized remote access and control over a victim's computer. It allows the attacker to perform various actions, such as controlling the mouse and keyboard, accessing files, and executing commands."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,A publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after an email account has been breached and its password subsequently changed. This suggests the tool establishes alternative access or persistence mechanisms.
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool allows an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on user email account passwords, and serve as a hidden backdoor for regaining entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
What is a hidden backdoor in the context of cyber attacks?,"A hidden backdoor is a clandestine method of accessing a system that bypasses normal security controls. It allows an attacker to re-enter a compromised system, even if the original entry points or malware implants have been detected and removed."
What is a mail exchange server?,"A mail exchange server, often referred to as an MX server, is a type of server that handles the sending and receiving of email messages. Attackers might interact with these servers to intercept or manipulate email traffic."
What is a brute force attack?,"A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information, such as a user's password. Attackers systematically try every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. Simple brute force attacks are often used against weak or easily guessable passwords."
