Define the concept of persistence in the context of cyber attacks.,"Persistence in the context of cyber attacks refers to the attacker's ability to maintain a presence within a compromised system or network over an extended period. This is often achieved through various methods, such as establishing footholds and backdoors, which allow them to regain access even if initial entry points are discovered and removed. A publicly available hacking tool, for instance, can enable an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after a password has been changed."
Explain what is meant by 'footholds' and 'backdoors' in cybersecurity.,"In cybersecurity, 'footholds' refer to initial points of access that an attacker establishes within a network or system. These can be exploited vulnerabilities or compromised credentials. 'Backdoors' are clandestine methods of bypassing normal authentication or security controls to gain unauthorized access to a system. Attackers often establish multiple footholds and backdoors to ensure continued access and control."

What should be done with vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests?,Vulnerabilities highlighted in penetration tests (pen-tests) must be fixed immediately.
What action should be taken with inactive email accounts?,Inactive email accounts must be removed immediately to reduce the attack surface area.
What framework is useful for considering the events of a cyber attack?,"The 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, is useful for considering the events of a cyber attack."
What does the 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework identify?,The 7 Steps Cyber Kill Chain framework identifies what adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objectives.
How many stages are in the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,The Cyber Kill Chain framework involves 7 stages.
What are the starting and ending stages of the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,The Cyber Kill Chain framework starts with early reconnaissance and concludes with the final goal of data exfiltration.
What is the purpose of keeping the Cyber Kill Chain framework in mind?,"Keeping the Cyber Kill Chain framework in mind will facilitate the understanding of the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the attacker."
What is reconnaissance in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Reconnaissance is the first stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, involving activities such as harvesting email addresses and conference information."
What occurs during the weaponization stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,Weaponization involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload.
Describe the delivery stage in the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The delivery stage involves delivering the weaponized bundle to the victim via various means such as email, web, or USB."
What is the exploitation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,Exploitation is the stage where an attacker exploits a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.
What happens during the installation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,Installation is the stage where malware is installed on the asset.
Explain the command and control (C2) stage in the Cyber Kill Chain.,The command and control (C2) stage involves establishing a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim.
What are 'Actions on Objectives' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives is the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, where intruders, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, accomplish their original objectives."
When was the first evidence of breach and control establishment over Workstation A?,The first evidence of breach and establishing control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017.
What did forensic investigations uncover regarding Workstation A?,Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server ('C2 server') from 23 August 2017.
Define 'callbacks' in the context of malware and C2 servers.,"Callbacks refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used to either fetch updates and instructions for the malware, or to send back stolen information from the compromised system."
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A by the CSA?,"The CSA discovered many malicious artefacts in Workstation A, including a log file which was a remnant of a malware set, a publicly available hacking tool, and a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'."
What capability did the log file found in Workstation A possess?,The log file found in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware that had password dumping capability.
What capabilities did 'RAT 1' provide to the attacker?,"'RAT 1' provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
