What are the differences between persistence and being well-resourced for an attacker?,"An attacker being **persistent** means they have established multiple footholds and backdoors, and carried out their attack over an extended period, making multiple attempts to access systems using various methods. In contrast, an attacker being **well-resourced** implies they are part of a group with an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
Explain the concept of an attacker being persistent.,"An attacker is considered **persistent** if they have successfully established multiple footholds and backdoors within a system. This persistence is demonstrated by the attacker carrying out their activities over a prolonged period, such as more than 10 months, and employing various methods to repeatedly attempt access to critical databases like the SCM database."
Describe what it means for an attacker to be well-resourced.,"An attacker being **well-resourced** signifies that they belong to a group possessing significant capabilities. This includes having an extensive **command and control network**, which is a system used to manage and direct malicious activities. Furthermore, a well-resourced attacker has the ability to develop a wide array of **customised tools**, which are software or scripts tailored for specific attack purposes, and they possess a broad spectrum of **technical expertise**."
Compare the attacker's persistence with their resourcefulness.,"The attacker's **persistence** is characterized by their ability to maintain access and continue their attack over a long duration, establishing multiple entry points and backdoors. This is distinct from being **well-resourced**, which refers to the attacker's access to extensive infrastructure, such as a broad command and control network, and their capacity to create specialized tools and leverage diverse technical skills. While persistence focuses on the duration and methods of attack, well-resourced describes the attacker's overall capabilities and assets."
What does it mean for cyber defences to be impregnable?,"Cyber defences being **impregnable** means they are completely secure and cannot be breached or penetrated by any attack. The document states that cyber defences will never be impregnable, implying that absolute security is unattainable."
Is it possible to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching a network perimeter?,"The document suggests that it may be difficult to prevent an **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** from breaching the network perimeter. An APT is a sophisticated and prolonged cyberattack where an unauthorized person gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. While difficult, the document implies that breaches are not always inevitable."
Was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable?,"No, the success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data was **not inevitable**. Although cyber defences may not be impregnable and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the network perimeter can be difficult, the outcome of the attack was not predetermined."
What are effective training methods for detecting phishing?,"Effective training methods to detect **phishing** must be conducted for all staff. Phishing refers to fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication. These training methods are often delivered through a tutorial format."
"How should internet connections to priced assets be managed, especially remote access?","Internet connections to priced assets must be regulated. This regulation is particularly important for **remote access**, which refers to the ability to connect to a network or system from a location outside the company's physical premises. Such access needs careful management when users are outside the company."
What security measures should be in place for important servers?,"Access to important servers must be secured with **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**, which requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. Additionally, access should not be bypassible, meaning that these security measures cannot be circumvented."
What is the recommended approach for handling coding vulnerabilities in applications?,"Any **coding vulnerability**, which is a flaw in the source code of an application that can be exploited by attackers, must be patched as soon as possible (ASAP). Organizations cannot rely on users to identify and report these vulnerabilities; proactive patching is essential."
What is the importance of a strong password policy?,"A strong password policy, along with its enforcement, is crucial for security. This involves establishing rules for creating and managing passwords that are difficult to guess or crack, and ensuring these rules are consistently applied. Such policies are often reinforced through tutorials."
What should be done with vulnerabilities identified during penetration tests?,"Vulnerabilities that are highlighted during **pen-tests** (penetration tests), which are simulated cyberattacks to evaluate security defenses, must be fixed immediately. This ensures that potential weaknesses are addressed promptly to prevent exploitation."
How can the attack surface area be reduced by managing email accounts?,"The **attack surface area**, which is the sum of all the points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment, can be reduced by removing inactive email accounts immediately. Inactive accounts can still be targets for attackers if compromised."
What is the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,"The **Cyber Kill Chain framework** is a model developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the seven stages an adversary must complete to achieve their objectives during a cyberattack. It starts with early reconnaissance and concludes with data exfiltration. Understanding this framework helps in comprehending the attacker's actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)."
What are the seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain framework?,"The seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain framework are: 1. Reconnaissance, 2. Weaponization, 3. Delivery, 4. Exploitation, 5. Installation, 6. Command & Control (C2), and 7. Actions on Objectives. This framework details the progression of an adversary's attack."
Describe the Reconnaissance stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The **Reconnaissance** stage is the first step in the Cyber Kill Chain. During this phase, adversaries gather information about their target, such as harvesting email addresses and conference information, to plan their attack."
Explain the Weaponization stage in the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The **Weaponization** stage of the Cyber Kill Chain involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload. An **exploit** is a piece of software, data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. A **backdoor** is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer system."
What happens during the Delivery stage of the Cyber Kill Chain?,"In the **Delivery** stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, the weaponized payload is delivered to the victim. This delivery can occur through various means, including email, web links, or USB drives."
Describe the Exploitation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,The **Exploitation** stage of the Cyber Kill Chain involves exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be leveraged by an attacker. Executing code allows the attacker to gain control or perform malicious actions.
What is the Installation stage in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The **Installation** stage of the Cyber Kill Chain is when the attacker installs malware on the targeted asset. Malware, short for malicious software, is software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system."
Explain the Command & Control (C2) stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The **Command & Control (C2)** stage of the Cyber Kill Chain establishes a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim. This allows the attacker to communicate with the compromised system, issue commands, and receive data."
What are 'Actions on Objectives' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The **Actions on Objectives** stage is the final step in the Cyber Kill Chain. With 'hands-on-keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original objectives, which could include data exfiltration, system disruption, or other malicious goals."
What is the significance of 'Actions on Objectives' in the context of a cyberattack?,"The **Actions on Objectives** stage represents the culmination of the attacker's efforts in the Cyber Kill Chain. It signifies that the attacker has achieved the necessary access and control to execute their ultimate goals, such as stealing data or disrupting operations, effectively completing their mission."
What were the first signs of breach and control established over Workstation A?,"The first evidence of breach and control over Workstation A was uncovered through forensic investigations, which revealed signs of **callbacks** to an overseas **command & control server** (referred to as a ""C2 server"") starting from August 23, 2017. This period of control extended from August to December 2017."
Define 'callbacks' in the context of cyber security.,**Callbacks** refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used by the malware to either fetch updates and instructions from the server or to send back stolen information to the attacker.
What is a 'C2 server'?,"A **C2 server**, short for Command and Control server, is a server used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems. It acts as a central point for issuing commands to malware and receiving data from the infected machines."
What malicious artefacts were discovered on Workstation A?,"CSA discovered several malicious artefacts on Workstation A. These included: (i) a log file that was a remnant of a malware set; (ii) a publicly available hacking tool; and (iii) a customised **Remote Access Trojan** (RAT) referred to as ""RAT 1""."
What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?,"A **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** is a type of malware that provides an attacker with the ability to access and control a victim's computer remotely. In this case, ""RAT 1"" enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
What capabilities did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform various functions, including executing **shell scripts** remotely, and uploading and downloading files. A **shell script** is a script that is interpreted by a command-line interpreter, or shell."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,A publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a **persistent presence** even after an email account has been breached and its password subsequently changed. This means the attacker can continue to access the system despite security updates.
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool allows an attacker to perform several actions. These include interacting remotely with **mail exchange servers**, performing simple **brute force attacks** on user email account passwords, and serving as a hidden **backdoor** for the attacker to regain entry if initial implants are removed."
Explain the function of a 'hidden backdoor' provided by a hacking tool.,"A hidden **backdoor** serves as a clandestine entry point for an attacker. In this context, a hacking tool can act as a hidden backdoor, allowing the attacker to regain access to the system even if the initial malware or access methods are detected and removed. This ensures continued unauthorized access."
What is the purpose of establishing multiple footholds and backdoors?,"Establishing **multiple footholds** and **backdoors** allows an attacker to ensure continued access to a compromised system. A **foothold** is an initial point of entry, while a **backdoor** is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication. Having multiple of these increases the attacker's resilience against detection and removal efforts."
How does an attacker carry out an attack over a period of 10 months?,"An attacker carrying out an attack over a period of 10 months demonstrates significant **persistence**. This extended duration implies repeated actions, sustained effort to maintain access, and potentially evolving tactics to overcome defenses, all while making multiple attempts to access critical systems like the SCM database."
What are the implications of an attacker using various methods to access a database?,"An attacker using **various methods** to access a database indicates a sophisticated and adaptable approach. This suggests that the attacker is not relying on a single exploit but is employing a range of techniques, potentially including social engineering, exploiting different vulnerabilities, or using custom tools, to achieve their objective, highlighting their persistence and resourcefulness."
What constitutes an 'extensive command and control network' for an attacker?,"An **extensive command and control network** for an attacker refers to a robust and widespread infrastructure that facilitates communication and management of compromised systems. This network allows the attacker to issue commands, receive data, and coordinate activities across multiple infected devices, often spanning geographically diverse locations."
What does the capability to develop 'numerous customised tools' imply about an attacker?,"The capability to develop **numerous customised tools** implies that an attacker is highly skilled and adaptable. **Customised tools** are specifically designed for particular tasks or targets, suggesting that the attacker can tailor their attack methods to exploit unique vulnerabilities or overcome specific defenses, rather than relying solely on generic malware."
How does a 'wide range of technical expertise' benefit an attacker?,"A **wide range of technical expertise** benefits an attacker by enabling them to employ diverse and sophisticated attack vectors. This expertise can cover areas such as network penetration, malware development, social engineering, and system exploitation, allowing the attacker to adapt their strategy and overcome various security measures effectively."
Compare the attacker's persistence with their extensive command and control network.,"The attacker's **persistence** is demonstrated by their long-term engagement and multiple attempts to compromise systems, often involving established footholds and backdoors. In contrast, an **extensive command and control network** refers to the infrastructure the attacker uses to manage and direct their operations. While persistence focuses on the duration and continuity of the attack, the C2 network is the operational backbone that enables such sustained activity."
What is the relationship between an attacker's custom tools and their technical expertise?,"The ability to develop **customised tools** is a direct result of an attacker's **technical expertise**. Having a wide range of technical skills allows an attacker to create specialized software and scripts tailored to exploit specific vulnerabilities or achieve particular objectives, making their attacks more effective and harder to detect than those using off-the-shelf tools."
How can cyber defences be improved to counter persistent attackers?,"While the document doesn't explicitly detail improvement strategies, it highlights that attackers are **persistent** and establish **multiple footholds and backdoors** over extended periods. This suggests that defenses need to be robust enough to detect and respond to prolonged, multi-stage attacks, and to actively hunt for and remove persistent threats rather than relying solely on perimeter defenses."
What is the role of 'data exfiltration' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,**Data exfiltration** is the final goal in the Cyber Kill Chain framework. It refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network. This stage is where the adversary achieves their ultimate objective of stealing sensitive information.
How does the Cyber Kill Chain framework help in understanding attacker TTPs?,"The **Cyber Kill Chain framework** facilitates understanding of an attacker's **TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) by providing a structured model of their attack progression. By mapping observed actions to the stages of the kill chain, investigators can better comprehend the attacker's methods, motivations, and potential future actions."
What is the difference between 'Installation' and 'Actions on Objectives' in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"The **Installation** stage in the Cyber Kill Chain involves the attacker placing malware on the victim's system. The subsequent stage, **Actions on Objectives**, is when the attacker, having achieved the necessary access and control through installation and command and control, proceeds to accomplish their ultimate goals, such as stealing data or disrupting services."
Explain the concept of 'exploiting a vulnerability' in the context of cyberattacks.,"Exploiting a **vulnerability** means taking advantage of a weakness or flaw in a system, software, or hardware to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions. In the Exploitation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, this is done to execute code on the victim's system, which is a critical step towards compromising the target."
What is the purpose of 'delivering a weaponized bundle'?,"Delivering a **weaponized bundle** is the objective of the Delivery stage in the Cyber Kill Chain. This bundle contains the exploit and payload designed to compromise the victim's system. The delivery mechanism, such as email or a web link, is chosen to trick the user into executing the malicious content."
