Explain the Cyber Kill Chain Framework.,"The Cyber Kill Chain Framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a model that outlines the 7 steps adversaries must complete to achieve their objectives. It describes a progression through 7 stages, starting from early reconnaissance and culminating in the final goal of data exfiltration. Understanding this framework helps in comprehending the actions, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by attackers."
What are the 7 stages of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework?,"The 7 stages of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework are: 1. Reconnaissance (Harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.), 2. Weaponization (Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload), 3. Delivery (Delivering weaponized bundle to the victim via email, web, USB, etc.), 4. Exploitation (Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on victim's system), 5. Installation (Installing malware on the asset), 6. Command & Control (C2) (Command channel for remote manipulation of victim), and 7. Actions on Objectives (With 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals)."
What is reconnaissance in the context of the Cyber Kill Chain?,Reconnaissance is the first stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. It involves harvesting information such as email addresses and conference details.
What is weaponization in the Cyber Kill Chain?,Weaponization is the second stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. It involves coupling an exploit with a backdoor to create a deliverable payload.

Explain the installation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain.,"The installation stage, the fifth in the Cyber Kill Chain, involves installing malware on the targeted asset."
What is command and control (C2) in the Cyber Kill Chain?,Command and Control (C2) is the sixth stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. It establishes a command channel for the remote manipulation of the victim.
What are actions on objectives in the Cyber Kill Chain?,"Actions on Objectives is the seventh and final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain. At this point, with 'Hands on Keyboard' access, intruders accomplish their original goals."
"When was the first evidence of breach and control established over Workstation A, and what was it?",The first evidence of breach and the establishment of control over Workstation A occurred between August and December 2017. Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command & control server (C2 server) starting from 23 August 2017.
What are callbacks in the context of malware and C2 servers?,Callbacks refer to communications between malware and C2 servers. These communications are used either to fetch updates and instructions for the malware or to send back stolen information to the attacker.
What malicious artefacts were discovered in Workstation A?,CSA discovered several malicious artefacts in Workstation A. These included: (i) a log file that was a remnant of a malware set; (ii) a publicly available hacking tool; and (iii) a customized Remote Access Trojan referred to as 'RAT 1'.
What was the capability of the log file found in Workstation A?,The log file found in Workstation A was a remnant file from a known malware that possessed password dumping capability.
What capabilities did RAT 1 provide to the attacker?,"RAT 1 provided the attacker with the capability to access and control the workstation. This enabled the attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading and downloading files."
How does a publicly available hacking tool help an attacker maintain presence?,A publicly available hacking tool enables an attacker to maintain a persistent presence even after an email account has been breached and its password subsequently changed.
What actions can an attacker perform using a hacking tool?,"A hacking tool allows an attacker to interact remotely with mail exchange servers, perform simple brute force attacks on a user's email account password, and serve as a hidden backdoor for the attacker to regain entry into the system if initial implants are removed."
Summarize the attacker's persistence and duration of the attack.,"The attacker was persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. The attack was carried out over a period of more than 10 months, during which multiple attempts were made to access the SCM database using various methods."
Describe the attacker's resources and technical capabilities.,The attacker was a well-resourced group with an extensive command and control network. They possessed the capability to develop numerous customized tools and had a wide range of technical expertise.
Can cyber defenses prevent all breaches by Advanced Persistent Threats?,"While cyber defenses may never be completely impregnable and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) from breaching a network perimeter can be difficult, the success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data is not inevitable."
