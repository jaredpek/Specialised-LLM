Compare the overall cyberattack period with the data exfiltration period in the SingHealth data breach.,"The overall cyberattack on the SingHealth patient database occurred between August 23, 2017, and July 20, 2018. In contrast, the data exfiltration, which is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system, took place over a shorter, more concentrated period, specifically from June 27, 2018, to July 4, 2018."
What are the differences between the total number of patients affected and the number of patients whose outpatient medication records were exfiltrated?,"The SingHealth cyberattack resulted in the illegal access and exfiltration of personal particulars for 1.5 million patients. A subset of these patients, specifically around 159,000, also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. Exfiltration refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system."
Compare the roles of SingHealth and Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) regarding the SCM system during the cyberattack.,"During the cyberattack, SingHealth owned the SCM system, which is an electronic medical records software solution. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (""IHIS"") was responsible for administering and operating the SCM system, including implementing cybersecurity measures, as well as for security incident response and reporting."
What are the differences between the SCM database and Citrix servers in the context of the SingHealth network?,"The SCM database contains the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. Citrix servers, on the other hand, operate as an intermediary, allowing users to access the SCM database from front-end workstations. These Citrix servers played a critical role in the Cyber Attack by being compromised and exploited."
Compare the initial access method used by the attacker with the method used for lateral movement within the SingHealth network.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, primarily by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. Phishing attacks are a type of social engineering where an attacker attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. Lateral movement, which is the technique used by attackers to progressively move deeper into a network after initial compromise, occurred over six months (December 2017 to June 2018). During this phase, the attacker compromised many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers, and later used compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers."
What are the differences between the general patient data exfiltrated and the data specifically targeted for the Prime Minister?,"For the 1.5 million patients affected by the breach, the exfiltrated personal particulars included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. In the case of the Prime Minister, his personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed, indicating a more focused and comprehensive exfiltration of his health-related information. Exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system."
Compare the SCM as an electronic medical records software solution with the patient electronic medical records themselves.,"The SCM (SingHealth Clinical Management) is an electronic medical records software solution that allows healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. The patient electronic medical records, in contrast, are the actual data contained within the SCM database, comprising sensitive information such as names, NRIC numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and outpatient dispensed medication records. The SCM is the system, while the patient electronic medical records are the data managed by that system."
What are the differences between the dormant period and the lateral movement period in the cyberattack timeline?,"After gaining initial access to SingHealth's IT network, the attacker lay dormant for four months. A dormant period refers to a phase where an attacker maintains access to a system without actively performing noticeable malicious actions. Following this, the attacker commenced lateral movement, which is the process of moving through a network to gain access to other systems, for six months, between December 2017 and June 2018. During this lateral movement phase, the attacker compromised numerous endpoints and servers."
Compare the role of front-end workstations with SCM servers in the user authentication process for the SCM database.,"In the SingHealth user authentication process, front-end workstations are the user PCs where individuals launch the SCM system via Citrix. SCM servers, specifically the SCM Security Server, are responsible for receiving user credentials for authentication and, once authenticated, allow access to the SCM database. The SCM database contains the patient electronic medical records."
What are the differences between user access to the SCM database and attacker access to the SCM database?,"Legitimate users access the SCM database via Citrix servers, which act as an intermediary between their front-end workstations and the SCM database, following a defined authentication process. In contrast, the attacker exploited vulnerabilities, initially infecting front-end workstations and then using compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers, ultimately querying and exfiltrating data from the SCM database."
Compare the purpose of the SCM Security Server with the SCM Database within the SCM Servers component.,"Within the SCM Servers component, the SCM Security Server is responsible for receiving user credentials and performing authentication. Its purpose is to verify the identity of users attempting to access the system. The SCM Database, on the other hand, is where the actual patient electronic medical records are stored. Its purpose is to house and manage the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network."
What are the differences between the types of accounts compromised by the attacker?,"During the cyberattack, the attacker compromised a large number of both user accounts and administrator accounts. User accounts typically have standard permissions for day-to-day operations, while administrator accounts possess elevated privileges, allowing for broader control and access over systems and data. The compromise of both types of accounts facilitated the attacker's lateral movement and privilege escalation."
Compare the initial entry point of the attacker with the final point of data exfiltration as depicted in the workflow diagram.,"The initial entry point of the attacker was Workstation A within Healthcare Institution A, occurring on August 23, 2017.
