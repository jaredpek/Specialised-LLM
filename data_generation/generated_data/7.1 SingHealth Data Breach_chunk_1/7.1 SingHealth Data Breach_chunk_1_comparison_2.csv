Compare the overall timeframe of the SingHealth cyberattack with the period of data exfiltration.,"The overall timeframe of the SingHealth cyberattack spanned from August 23, 2017, to July 20, 2018. In contrast, the period of data exfiltration, which is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system, occurred between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018. This indicates that the exfiltration of data was a specific phase within the broader duration of the cyberattack."
What is the difference between the total number of patients whose personal particulars were exfiltrated and the number of patients whose outpatient dispensed medication records were also exfiltrated?,"The personal particulars, which include names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, of 1.5 million patients were illegally accessed and exfiltrated. Among these 1.5 million patients, approximately 159,000 also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. Therefore, while 1.5 million patients had their basic personal particulars compromised, a subset of 159,000 patients had additional, more sensitive medication records exfiltrated."
Compare the general types of personal particulars exfiltrated from 1.5 million patients with the specific data targeted for the Prime Minister.,"The general types of personal particulars exfiltrated from 1.5 million patients included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. For the Prime Minister, the data specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed included his personal and outpatient medication data. This indicates a more focused and potentially higher-value target for the attacker beyond the general patient data."
Compare the responsibilities of SingHealth with those of Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) regarding the SCM system during the cyberattack.,"At the time of the cyberattack, SingHealth owned the SCM system. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) was responsible for administering and operating the SCM system, which is an electronic medical records software solution. IHIS's responsibilities also included implementing cybersecurity measures for the system, as well as security incident response and reporting. Thus, SingHealth held ownership, while IHIS managed the system's operations, security, and incident handling."
"What is the difference between the SingHealth ""SCM"" database and the broader SCM system?","The SingHealth ""SCM"" database contains the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. The broader SCM system, on the other hand, is an electronic medical records software solution that allows healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. It comprises front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database itself. Therefore, the SCM database is a core component of the larger SCM system."
Compare the legitimate user authentication process to access the SCM Database with how the attacker ultimately queried the SCM Database.,"In the legitimate user authentication process, users launch the SCM via CITRIX at a User PC. User credentials are then sent to the SCM Security Server for authentication, and upon successful authentication, users log in and start using SCM. The attacker, however, gained initial entry into the IT network, lay dormant, then performed lateral movement and privilege escalation, compromising Citrix servers. From a compromised SCM (likely via compromised Citrix servers), the attacker queried the SCM Database to exfiltrate data."
Compare the initial access method used by the attacker to gain entry into SingHealth's IT network with the methods used for lateral movement.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. After this initial entry and a dormant period, the attacker commenced lateral movement, which is the technique of moving deeper into a network after initial access. This involved compromising many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database, and also compromising a large number of user and administrator accounts."
What is the difference in duration between the attacker's dormant period and the period of lateral movement within the SingHealth IT network?,"After gaining initial access, the attacker lay dormant for 4 months. Following this dormant period, the attacker commenced lateral movement, which is the process of moving through a network to gain access to other systems, for a period of 6 months, specifically between December 2017 and June 2018."
Compare the role of front-end workstations in the normal SingHealth user authentication process with their role in the initial phase of the cyberattack.,"In the normal SingHealth user authentication process, front-end workstations (User PCs) are where users initiate access to the SCM system by launching SCM via CITRIX. In the initial phase of the cyberattack, front-end workstations played a critical role as the entry point; the attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network by infecting these front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks."
Compare the function of Citrix servers in the normal SingHealth user authentication process with their critical role in the cyberattack.,"In the normal SingHealth user authentication process, Citrix servers (part of the Citrix Farm) act as an intermediary, allowing users to access the SCM database from front-end workstations. User credentials are sent via Citrix to the SCM Security Server for authentication. In the cyberattack, Citrix servers played a critical role; they were compromised during the lateral movement phase and were subsequently used by the attacker, who remotely connected to the SGH Citrix servers from compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines, to query the SCM Database and exfiltrate data."
Compare the data transfer described in step 5a with step 5b in the cyberattack workflow diagram.,"Both step 5a and step 5b in the cyberattack workflow diagram describe data transfer events that occurred between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018. In step 5a, data was transferred from the SCM DB Servers to CITRIX Server 2 @SGH. In step 5b, data was transferred from the SCM DB Servers to CITRIX Server 3 @HDC. The key difference is the destination Citrix server involved in the transfer, indicating multiple points of data staging or exfiltration preparation."
"What is the difference between the ""Compromised SCM"" event (step 3) and the ""Queried SCM Database"" event (step 4) in the cyberattack workflow?","The ""Compromised SCM"" event (step 3), which occurred on June 26, 2018, signifies that the SCM system itself, or components related to it, were breached and under the attacker's control. The ""Queried SCM Database"" event (step 4), which occurred between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018, represents the attacker actively sending queries to the SCM Database to retrieve information, following the compromise of the SCM system. The compromise precedes and enables the querying of the database."
Compare the role of Healthcare Institution A with Healthcare Institution B in the initial stages of the cyberattack workflow.,"Healthcare Institution A was the site of the initial entry into the SingHealth IT network, specifically at Workstation A, which occurred on August 23, 2017. From Workstation A, lateral movement and privilege escalation occurred between December 2017 and June 2018, leading to Workstation B at Healthcare Institution B. Workstation B was then involved in the compromised SCM event on June 26, 2018, and subsequently in the data exfiltration process via the Internet."
"Compare a ""User PC"" as depicted in the authentication process with a ""front-end workstation"" as mentioned in the summary of key events.","A ""User PC"" as depicted in the authentication process is a type of front-end workstation used by legitimate users to launch the SCM system via CITRIX. A ""front-end workstation"" as mentioned in the summary of key events refers to the initial entry point for the attacker into SingHealth's IT network. These workstations were infected, most likely through phishing attacks, around August 23, 2017, to gain initial access."
What is the relationship and difference between the SCM Security Server and the SCM Database in the user authentication process?,"In the user authentication process, the SCM Security Server is responsible for receiving user credentials for authentication. Once authentication is successful, users are then able to access the SCM Database, which stores the patient electronic medical records. Therefore, the SCM Security Server acts as a gatekeeper, verifying user identity before granting access to the SCM Database."
Compare SingHealth's ownership of the SCM system with IHIS's responsibility for administering and operating it.,"SingHealth held the ownership of the SCM system at the time of the cyberattack. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS), while not owning the system, was responsible for administering and operating it. This means SingHealth had proprietary rights, while IHIS was tasked with the day-to-day management, maintenance, and functional oversight of the electronic medical records software solution."
"Compare the types of data categorized as ""personal particulars"" with ""outpatient dispensed medication records"" that were exfiltrated.","The data categorized as ""personal particulars"" that were exfiltrated included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. ""Outpatient dispensed medication records,"" on the other hand, refer specifically to information about medications prescribed and dispensed to patients in an outpatient setting. While personal particulars identify an individual, outpatient dispensed medication records provide sensitive health-related information."
Compare the date of the attacker's initial access to SingHealth's IT network with the start date of the data exfiltration.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017. The data exfiltration, which is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system, commenced much later, on June 27, 2018. This indicates a significant period of time, approximately 10 months, between the initial breach and the actual extraction of data."
Compare the overall end date of the cyberattack with the end date of the data exfiltration.,"The overall cyberattack on the SingHealth patient database concluded on July 20, 2018. The data exfiltration, which is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system, ended earlier, on July 4, 2018. This means that while the exfiltration of data ceased on July 4, 2018, the broader cyberattack activities or its detection and containment efforts continued for an additional two weeks until July 20, 2018."
"Compare the use of ""compromised user workstations"" with ""suspected virtual machines"" by the attacker from May 2018.","Starting from May 2018, the attacker made use of both ""compromised user workstations"" and ""suspected virtual machines"" within the SingHealth IT network. Both were utilized to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers. This indicates the attacker leveraged multiple types of compromised computing environments to establish connections to critical infrastructure like the Citrix servers."
"Compare what the document refers to as the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network with the ""personal particulars"" that were exfiltrated.","The document refers to the patient electronic medical records contained in the SingHealth ""SCM"" database as the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network, highlighting their immense value and sensitivity. The ""personal particulars"" that were exfiltrated are a specific subset of this valuable data, including names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. While personal particulars are critical, the ""crown jewels"" encompass the entire scope of patient electronic medical records."
"What is the difference between a ""CITRIX SERVER (SCM CLIENT)"" and the ""SCM SECURITY SERVER"" in the user authentication process?","In the user authentication process, a ""CITRIX SERVER (SCM CLIENT)"" is part of the Citrix Farm, which acts as an intermediary for users to launch SCM. It facilitates the connection from the user's PC to the SCM system. The ""SCM SECURITY SERVER,"" on the other hand, is a component within the SCM Servers responsible for receiving and processing user credentials for authentication. The Citrix server forwards the credentials, and the SCM Security Server performs the actual authentication."
"Compare the ""Attacker's movement to SCM DB Server"" with the ""Flow of data exfiltration"" as indicated in the legend of the cyberattack workflow diagram.","The legend in the cyberattack workflow diagram distinguishes between two types of attacker activity. ""Attacker's movement to SCM DB Server"" (represented by a black arrow) indicates the path the attacker took to gain access to the database. ""Flow of data exfiltration"" (represented by a red arrow) indicates the direction and path of the stolen data being transferred out of the system. The movement is about gaining control, while the flow of data exfiltration is about the actual theft of information."
"Compare ""phishing attacks"" as a method of initial access with ""lateral movement"" as a phase of the cyberattack.","Phishing attacks are a method of initial access, which is how the attacker first gained entry into SingHealth's IT network, specifically by infecting front-end workstations. Lateral movement, conversely, is a subsequent phase of the cyberattack that occurred after initial access. It involves the attacker moving through the network, compromising additional endpoints, servers (including Citrix servers), and user/administrator accounts, to expand their control and reach deeper into the system, ultimately leading to the SCM database."
"Compare the ""SingHealth network"" with the ""SCM system"" in the context of the cyberattack.","The ""SingHealth network"" refers to the broader IT infrastructure of SingHealth, which the attacker initially gained access to. The ""SCM system"" is a specific electronic medical records software solution within this network, comprising front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database. The SCM system, containing the ""crown jewels"" of patient electronic medical records, was the primary target within the larger SingHealth network."
"Compare how healthcare staff legitimately access ""real-time patient data"" via the SCM with how the attacker ""queried the SCM Database.""","Healthcare staff legitimately access ""real-time patient data"" through the SCM, which is an electronic medical records software solution. This access is facilitated via Citrix servers after a proper user authentication process. The attacker, however, ""queried the SCM Database"" after gaining unauthorized access to the SingHealth IT network, compromising front-end workstations, performing lateral movement, and compromising Citrix servers. This querying was part of the data exfiltration process, not a legitimate use of the system."
"What is the difference between ""compromised user accounts"" and ""compromised administrator accounts"" in the context of the cyberattack?","In the context of the cyberattack, both ""compromised user accounts"" and ""compromised administrator accounts"" refer to accounts that were breached and taken over by the attacker. The difference lies in their privileges: user accounts typically have standard access rights, while administrator accounts possess elevated privileges, allowing for broader control over systems and data. Compromising administrator accounts would grant the attacker significantly more power and access within the network during lateral movement."
"Compare the ""Initial entry"" event at Workstation A with the ""Compromised SCM"" event associated with Workstation B in the cyberattack workflow.","The ""Initial entry"" event occurred on August 23, 2017, at Workstation A in Healthcare Institution A, marking the attacker's first successful breach into the SingHealth IT network. The ""Compromised SCM"" event, which occurred on June 26, 2018, is associated with Workstation B in Healthcare Institution B. This event signifies that the SCM system, or its components, were compromised, which was a result of the attacker's lateral movement and privilege escalation that originated from the initial entry point at Workstation A."
"Compare the ""SCM Database"" with ""Medical Records"" as depicted in the cyberattack workflow diagram.","The ""SCM Database"" is the specific database component of the SCM system that stores patient information. ""Medical Records"" is a label used in the cyberattack workflow diagram to represent the content or type of data residing within the SCM DB Servers. Essentially, the SCM Database is the container, and Medical Records are the sensitive patient data stored within that container, which were the target of the exfiltration."
Compare SingHealth's ownership of SCM with IHIS's cybersecurity measures.,"SingHealth owned the SCM system, which means they held the proprietary rights to the electronic medical records software solution. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS), while not the owner, was responsible for implementing cybersecurity measures for this system. This indicates a division of responsibility where the owner (SingHealth) entrusted the security implementation to a separate entity (IHIS)."
"Compare the ""Data exfiltration"" event (step 6) with the ""Data transferred"" events (steps 5a, 5b) in the cyberattack workflow.","The ""Data transferred"" events (steps 5a and 5b), occurring between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018, describe the movement of data from the SCM DB Servers to various Citrix servers (CITRIX Server 2 @SGH and CITRIX Server 3 @HDC). These steps represent internal staging or preparation for removal. The ""Data exfiltration"" event (step 6), occurring during the same period, represents the final stage where the data is actually removed from the SingHealth network, specifically from Healthcare Institution B, via the Internet."
"What is the difference between an ""electronic medical records software solution"" and the ""patient electronic medical records"" themselves?","An ""electronic medical records software solution"" refers to the system or application, such as the SCM, that allows for the management, storage, and access of patient health information. The ""patient electronic medical records"" themselves are the actual data or information pertaining to a patient's medical history, treatments, and other health-related details, which are stored within such a software solution's database. The software solution is the tool, and the records are the data it manages."
"Compare the role of ""front-end workstations"" with ""Citrix servers"" as components of the SCM system.","As components of the SCM system, ""front-end workstations"" are the user-facing computers where healthcare staff interact with the system. ""Citrix servers"" act as an intermediary layer between these front-end workstations and the SCM database. Users access the SCM database via Citrix servers, which process and manage the connections from multiple workstations to the central database. Citrix servers played a critical role in the cyberattack by facilitating access to the SCM database."
"Compare IHIS's responsibility for ""administering and operating the system"" with its responsibility for ""security incident response and reporting.""","Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) had two distinct sets of responsibilities. ""Administering and operating the system"" refers to the ongoing management and functional upkeep of the SCM system, including its daily operations and maintenance. ""Security incident response and reporting"" refers to IHIS's duties after a security breach, which involve detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and documenting security incidents, as well as reporting them to relevant parties."
"Compare the cyberattack's ""unprecedented scale & sophistication"" with the specific targeting of the Prime Minister's data.","The cyberattack was characterized by its ""unprecedented scale & sophistication,"" indicating a high level of planning, technical skill, and broad impact across the SingHealth patient database. Within this large-scale attack, there was also a specific targeting of the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data, which was repeatedly accessed. This highlights that while the attack had a wide reach, it also included highly focused objectives on specific, high-value targets."
"Compare the ""Compromised SCM"" event shown in the workflow diagram with the ""compromised user workstations"" mentioned in the summary of key events.","The ""compromised user workstations"" mentioned in the summary refer to the initial entry point of the attacker into the SingHealth IT network, likely through phishing attacks around August 23, 2017. These workstations were used by the attacker from May 2018 to remotely connect to SGH Citrix servers. The ""Compromised SCM"" event (June 26, 2018) in the workflow diagram signifies a later stage where the SCM system itself, or its components, were breached, likely as a result of the attacker's lateral movement originating from those initially compromised workstations and subsequent privilege escalation."
"What is the difference between ""User Credential sent to SCM Security for authentication"" and being ""Authenticated"" in the SingHealth user authentication process?","In the SingHealth user authentication process, ""User Credential sent to SCM Security for authentication"" is the action where a user's identifying information (like username and password) is transmitted to the SCM Security Server for verification. ""Authenticated"" is the outcome of this process, meaning the SCM Security Server has successfully verified the user's credentials, confirming their identity and granting them permission to proceed and access the SCM system."
"Compare the ""Lateral movement & privilege escalation"" event (Diagram) with the description of ""lateral movement"" (Summary).","The ""Lateral movement & privilege escalation"" event in the workflow diagram specifies a period from December 2017 to June 2018, indicating the attacker's progression within the network and gaining higher access rights. The summary's description of ""lateral movement"" (also 6 months, Dec 2017-Jun 2018) elaborates on this by stating it involved compromising many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database, and also compromising user and administrator accounts. The diagram provides the timeline and general action, while the summary details the scope and methods of this movement."
"Compare the ""SingHealth patient database"" mentioned in the crisis overview with the ""SCM database"" described as the crown jewels.","The ""SingHealth patient database"" is a general term used in the crisis overview to describe the overall repository of patient information that was subjected to the cyberattack. The ""SCM database"" is a more specific term, identified as containing the patient electronic medical records and being the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. It is highly probable that the SCM database is the primary, or a critical component of, the broader SingHealth patient database that was targeted."
"Compare the legitimate action of ""Users launch SCM via CITRIX at User PC"" with the attacker's action to ""remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers.""","The legitimate action of ""Users launch SCM via CITRIX at User PC"" describes how authorized healthcare staff initiate their use of the SCM system from their workstations. This is part of the normal authentication process. The attacker's action to ""remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers"" from compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines, starting from May 2018, was an unauthorized and malicious act. This connection was established to further the attack, specifically to query the SCM Database, rather than for legitimate patient data access."
"Compare the overall characterization of the cyberattack as being of ""unprecedented scale & sophistication"" with ""phishing attacks"" as a likely initial entry method.","The cyberattack was characterized as being of ""unprecedented scale & sophistication,"" referring to its overall complexity, broad impact on 1.5 million patients, and the advanced techniques used throughout its various phases. ""Phishing attacks,"" on the other hand, are a specific, common method identified as the likely technique for the initial entry into the network, by infecting front-end workstations. While phishing might be a relatively simple initial vector, it enabled an attack that evolved into something of unprecedented scale and sophistication."
"Compare the description of ""healthcare staff to access real-time patient data"" with the ""Users launch SCM via CITRIX at User PC"" step in the authentication process.","The description of ""healthcare staff to access real-time patient data"" highlights the purpose and benefit of the SCM system: to provide immediate access to up-to-date patient information for medical professionals. The ""Users launch SCM via CITRIX at User PC"" step in the authentication process describes the initial technical action taken by these healthcare staff to achieve that purpose. It is the first step in the workflow that enables legitimate access to the real-time patient data."
"Compare the attacker's action of ""compromising many endpoints and servers"" during lateral movement with ""compromising a large number of user and administrator accounts.""","During lateral movement, the attacker engaged in two distinct but related actions. ""Compromising many endpoints and servers"" refers to gaining unauthorized control over various computing devices and network resources within the SingHealth IT network, including Citrix servers. Simultaneously, the attacker was ""compromising a large number of user and administrator accounts."" This means gaining unauthorized access to the credentials and privileges associated with individuals' accounts, which would facilitate further lateral movement and access to the compromised endpoints and servers."
"Compare the significance of the SCM database being the ""crown jewels"" with the Citrix servers playing a ""critical role"" in the cyberattack.","The SCM database is considered the ""crown jewels"" because it contains the highly valuable and sensitive patient electronic medical records, making it the ultimate target of the cyberattack. The Citrix servers played a ""critical role"" in the cyberattack not because they contained the data themselves, but because they served as the intermediary through which legitimate users accessed the SCM database. By compromising these Citrix servers, the attacker gained a crucial pathway to access and query the ""crown jewels"" (the SCM database) and exfiltrate the data."
Compare the Data Exfiltration Period (27/6/18 to 4/7/18) with the Queried SCM Database Period (27 June 2018 - 4 July 2018).,"The Data Exfiltration Period, which is the timeframe during which personal particulars and medication records were illegally accessed and transferred out of the system, was from June 27, 2018, to July 4, 2018. The Queried SCM Database Period, which is when the attacker actively sent requests to retrieve information from the SCM Database, also occurred during the exact same timeframe: June 27, 2018, to July 4, 2018. This indicates that the querying of the database was directly linked to and immediately preceded or coincided with the actual exfiltration of data."
"Compare the general period of ""lateral movement"" (Dec 2017 - Jun 2018) with the specific period from ""May 2018"" when the attacker began remotely connecting to SGH Citrix servers.","The general period of ""lateral movement"" spanned 6 months, from December 2017 to June 2018, during which the attacker expanded their presence within the network by compromising various endpoints and servers. The specific period from ""May 2018"" marks a particular activity within this broader lateral movement phase: it was when the attacker began making use of compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers. This specific action was a key step towards accessing the SCM database."
Compare SingHealth's ownership of the SCM system with IHIS's responsibility for security incident response and reporting.,"SingHealth owned the SCM system, meaning they held the proprietary rights to the electronic medical records software solution. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS), while not the owner, was responsible for security incident response and reporting. This means that in the event of a security breach, IHIS was tasked with managing the incident, including its detection, containment, and resolution, as well as communicating information about the incident to relevant parties."
"What is the difference between ""patient electronic medical records"" as the ""crown jewels"" and ""outpatient dispensed medication records"" that were exfiltrated for a subset of patients?","""Patient electronic medical records"" are broadly defined as the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network, encompassing all valuable and sensitive health information stored in the SCM database. ""Outpatient dispensed medication records"" are a specific type of data within these broader electronic medical records, detailing medications prescribed and dispensed to patients in an outpatient setting. While all outpatient medication records are part of electronic medical records, only a subset of patients had these specific medication records exfiltrated in addition to their basic personal particulars."
"Compare the date of the attacker's ""Initial entry"" into the network with the date when the ""SCM"" was compromised.","The attacker's ""Initial entry"" into the SingHealth IT network occurred on August 23, 2017, at Workstation A. The ""SCM"" (electronic medical records software solution) was compromised much later, on June 26, 2018. This significant time gap of approximately 10 months indicates that the initial breach was followed by a period of dormancy, lateral movement, and privilege escalation before the core SCM system itself was successfully compromised."
"Compare the normal process where ""Users would access the SCM database via Citrix servers"" with the attack event where ""Data transferred"" occurred from the SCM DB Servers.","Normally, ""Users would access the SCM database via Citrix servers"" as an intermediary step in a legitimate authentication and data retrieval process, allowing healthcare staff to view patient data. In the attack event, ""Data transferred"" occurred from the SCM DB Servers to compromised Citrix servers (CITRIX Server 2 @SGH and CITRIX Server 3 @HDC) between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018. This was an unauthorized transfer of data out of the database, facilitated by compromised Citrix servers, as part of the data exfiltration process, rather than legitimate user access."
