"When was the SCM compromised, and at which location, according to the workflow?","The SCM was compromised on 26 June 2018, at Workstation B within Healthcare Institution B."
"How was the SCM Database queried during the attack, and what was the timeframe for this activity?",The SCM Database was queried from CITRIX Server 1 @SGH. This activity took place between 27 June 2018 and 4 July 2018.
Describe the data transfer process from the SCM DB Servers to the Citrix servers during the exfiltration phase.,"During the exfiltration phase, data was transferred from the SCM DB Servers to CITRIX Server 2 @SGH. This transfer occurred between 27 June 2018 and 4 July 2018."
"What was the final step in the data exfiltration process, and how was the data moved out of the network?",The final step in the data exfiltration process was the transfer of data from Workstation B via the Internet. This data exfiltration occurred between 27 June 2018 and 4 July 2018.
What were the two main types of attacker activities depicted by the arrows in the workflow diagram?,The two main types of attacker activities depicted were the attacker's movement to the SCM DB Server and the flow of data exfiltration.
