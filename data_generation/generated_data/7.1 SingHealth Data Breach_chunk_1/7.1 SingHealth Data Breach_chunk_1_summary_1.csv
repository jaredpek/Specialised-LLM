Provide a comprehensive summary of the SingHealth data breach.,"The SingHealth data breach was a cyberattack of unprecedented scale and sophistication carried out on the SingHealth patient database between August 23, 2017, and July 20, 2018. Personal particulars of 1.5 million patients, including names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, were illegally accessed and exfiltrated between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018. Additionally, around 159,000 of these patients also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed. The attack involved initial access likely through phishing, followed by a dormant period, lateral movement, and compromise of critical systems like Citrix servers connected to the SCM database. The SCM (SingHealth's electronic medical records system) database holds the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network."
Summarise the timeline of the SingHealth cyberattack.,"The SingHealth cyberattack spanned from August 23, 2017, to July 20, 2018. Initial access to SingHealth's IT network occurred around August 23, 2017, likely through phishing attacks infecting front-end workstations. The attacker then lay dormant for four months. Lateral movement and privilege escalation commenced between December 2017 and June 2018, lasting six months, during which many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database, were compromised. Starting from May 2018, the attacker used compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to SGH Citrix servers. Data exfiltration, which involved querying the SCM database and transferring data, took place between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018."
What types of patient data were compromised in the SingHealth data breach?,"In the SingHealth data breach, personal particulars of 1.5 million patients were illegally accessed and exfiltrated. This data included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. Additionally, around 159,000 of these 1.5 million patients also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed. NRIC numbers refer to National Registration Identity Card numbers, which are unique identification numbers."
Describe the role of the SCM database in the SingHealth network and the cyberattack.,"The SCM database holds the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. The SCM, or electronic medical records software solution, allows healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. It comprises front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database itself. Users typically access the SCM database via Citrix servers, which act as an intermediary. In the cyberattack, the SCM database was the ultimate target, with attackers querying and exfiltrating data from it."
"Who owned the SCM system at the time of the cyberattack, and who was responsible for its administration and cybersecurity?","At the time of the cyberattack, SingHealth owned the SCM system. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited, referred to as ""IHiS,"" was responsible for administering and operating the system, including implementing cybersecurity measures. IHiS's responsibilities also included security incident response and reporting. The SCM is SingHealth's electronic medical records system."
Explain the initial entry method and the subsequent actions taken by the attacker in the SingHealth cyberattack.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, primarily by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. Phishing attacks are a method of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. After this initial entry, the attacker lay dormant for four months. Subsequently, between December 2017 and June 2018, the attacker commenced lateral movement and privilege escalation within the network, compromising numerous endpoints and servers, including the Citrix servers located in SGH that were connected to the SCM database. During this period, a large number of user and administrator accounts were also compromised."

The specific details included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. NRIC numbers refer to National Registration Identity Card numbers, which are unique identification numbers."
Describe the significance of Citrix servers in the SingHealth cyberattack.,"Citrix servers played a critical role in the SingHealth cyberattack. These servers act as an intermediary, allowing users to access the SCM database from front-end workstations. During the attack, the Citrix servers located in SGH were compromised as part of the attacker's lateral movement and privilege escalation phase. From May 2018, the attacker utilized compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to these SGH Citrix servers, ultimately facilitating access to the SCM database for data exfiltration. Citrix servers are servers that operate as an intermediary between front-end workstations and the SCM database, enabling user access."
"What is the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network, and what does it contain?","The ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network are the patient electronic medical records. These records are contained within the SingHealth ""SCM"" database.
