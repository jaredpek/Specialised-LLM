Analyse the primary target and scope of the SingHealth cyberattack.,"The primary target of the SingHealth cyberattack was the patient electronic medical records contained within the SingHealth ""SCM"" database. The scope of the attack involved the illegal access and exfiltration of personal particulars belonging to 1.5 million patients. These particulars included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. Additionally, around 159,000 of these 1.5 million patients also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed."
What insights can be derived from the timeline of the SingHealth cyberattack?,"Insights from the timeline of the SingHealth cyberattack reveal a prolonged and multi-stage incident. The overall cyberattack occurred between August 23, 2017, and July 20, 2018. Initial access to SingHealth's IT network was gained around August 23, 2017. Following this, the attacker lay dormant for four months before commencing lateral movement and privilege escalation activities, which lasted for six months, from December 2017 to June 2018. The actual data exfiltration, where personal particulars and medication records were stolen, took place over a concentrated period from June 27, 2018, to July 4, 2018."
Describe the role of the SCM database and its components within the SingHealth network.,"The SCM database is considered the ""crown jewel"" of the SingHealth network, as it contains the patient electronic medical records. The SCM, which stands for an electronic medical records software solution, enables healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. The system comprises front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database itself. Users access the SCM database through Citrix servers, which act as an intermediary between the front-end workstations and the SCM database. The Citrix servers played a critical role in the cyberattack."
Explain the responsibilities of SingHealth and IHIS concerning the SCM system and cybersecurity measures.,"SingHealth owned the SCM system at the time of the cyberattack. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (""IHIS"") was responsible for administering and operating the SCM system. This responsibility included implementing cybersecurity measures to protect the system. Furthermore, IHIS was also tasked with security incident response and reporting, meaning they were responsible for handling and reporting security breaches."
Outline the user authentication process for accessing the SCM Database as depicted in the system diagram.,"The user authentication process for accessing the SCM Database involves several steps. First, users launch the SCM application via CITRIX from their User PC, which is a front-end workstation. Next, user credentials are sent to the SCM Security Server for authentication. Once authenticated by the SCM Security Server, users are successfully logged in and can begin using the SCM system. This process highlights the intermediary role of the Citrix Farm and the SCM Security Server in granting access to the SCM Database."
Detail the initial entry method and subsequent activities of the attacker in the SingHealth IT network.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, primarily by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. After this initial breach, the attacker lay dormant for four months. Subsequently, they commenced a six-month period of lateral movement and privilege escalation, spanning from December 2017 to June 2018. During this phase, many endpoints and servers were compromised, including Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. The attacker also compromised a significant number of user and administrator accounts."
Describe how the attacker utilized compromised workstations and virtual machines in the later stages of the cyberattack.,"Starting from May 2018, the attacker leveraged compromised user workstations within the SingHealth IT network. Additionally, they made use of suspected virtual machines. These compromised assets were used to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers, indicating a strategic move to gain further control and access deeper into the network infrastructure that facilitated access to the SCM database."
What specific types of patient data were exfiltrated during the SingHealth cyberattack?,"During the SingHealth cyberattack, personal particulars of 1.5 million patients were exfiltrated. This data included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. In addition to these personal particulars, approximately 159,000 of these patients also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated."
Analyse the significance of Citrix servers in the SingHealth cyberattack.,"The Citrix servers played a critical role in the SingHealth cyberattack. These servers function as an intermediary, allowing users to access the SCM database from front-end workstations. During the attack, the attacker compromised Citrix servers located in SGH as part of their lateral movement and privilege escalation phase. Later, from May 2018, the attacker used compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to these SGH Citrix servers, indicating their importance as a gateway to the SCM database and a key component in the attack chain."
What is the definition of the SCM system in the context of SingHealth?,"The SCM system, in the context of SingHealth, is an electronic medical records software solution.

Explain the role of 'front-end workstations' in the SingHealth network architecture.,Front-end workstations are the user-facing computers from which healthcare staff would initiate access to the SCM system. They are the initial point where users launch SCM via Citrix and are part of the overall architecture that includes Citrix servers and the SCM database.
What is the significance of the SCM database being located in SGH?,"The document states that Citrix servers located in SGH were connected to the SCM database. This implies that the SCM database itself, or at least critical access points to it, were within the SGH infrastructure, making SGH a key location for the attack's progression."
How does the diagram illustrate the connection between User Workstations and the SCM Security Server?,"The diagram illustrates that users launch SCM via CITRIX at their User PC (User Workstation). User credentials are then sent from the CITRIX FARM (specifically a CITRIX SERVER SCM CLIENT) to the SCM Security Server for authentication, indicating an indirect connection mediated by the Citrix infrastructure."

"What does the term ""exfiltrated"" mean in the context of the data breach?","In the context of the data breach, ""exfiltrated"" means that data was illegally transferred out of the SingHealth network. This refers to the unauthorized removal or theft of patient personal particulars and medication records from the SCM database."
What was the role of Workstation A in the cyberattack workflow?,"Workstation A in Healthcare Institution A was the initial entry point for the attacker on August 23, 2017. It was also involved in the lateral movement and privilege escalation phase, and later, data was transferred to it from CITRIX Server 2 @SGH (Step 5b) as part of the exfiltration process."
How did the attacker achieve privilege escalation?,"The attacker achieved privilege escalation as part of a six-month phase (December 2017 - June 2018) that also involved lateral movement. This process involved gaining higher levels of access permissions within the network, which allowed them to compromise more endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers, and ultimately access the SCM database."
"What is an NRIC number, and why is its exfiltration significant?","An NRIC number is a National Registration Identity Card number, a unique identification number issued to citizens and permanent residents in Singapore. Its exfiltration is significant because it is a sensitive personal identifier that can be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities when combined with other personal particulars like names, addresses, and dates of birth."
"What does the term ""endpoints"" refer to in the context of network compromise?","In the context of network compromise, ""endpoints"" refer to end-user devices connected to the network, such as workstations (like User PCs), laptops, or other devices that can be accessed and controlled by users. Compromising endpoints allows attackers to gain initial access and serve as a launching point for further network penetration."
