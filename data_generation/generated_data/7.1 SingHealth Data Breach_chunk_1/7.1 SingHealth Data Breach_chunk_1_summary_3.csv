What does it mean for an attacker to 'lay dormant' in a network?,"For an attacker to ""lay dormant"" in a network means they remain undetected and inactive for a period after gaining initial access. In the SingHealth breach, the attacker lay dormant for 4 months before commencing lateral movement. This period allows them to avoid detection and plan subsequent actions."
What are 'front-end workstations' in the context of the initial access?,"In the context of the initial access to the SingHealth network, ""front-end workstations"" are the user computers or devices that were infected, most likely through phishing attacks.

Summarise the overall timeline of the SingHealth cyberattack from initial entry to data exfiltration.,"The SingHealth cyberattack began with initial entry around August 23, 2017, likely via phishing attacks infecting front-end workstations. The attacker then lay dormant for 4 months. From December 2017 to June 2018, a 6-month period of lateral movement and privilege escalation occurred, compromising endpoints, servers, and a large number of user and administrator accounts, including Citrix servers connected to the SCM database. Starting May 2018, the attacker used compromised workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to SGH Citrix servers. The SCM system was compromised on June 26, 2018. Finally, data exfiltration, including querying the SCM database and transferring data, took place between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018, with the overall attack concluding by July 20, 2018. ""Exfiltration"" refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system, and ""SCM"" is an electronic medical records software solution."
What is the significance of the attack being described as 'unprecedented scale & sophistication'?,"The description of the attack as being of ""unprecedented scale & sophistication"" highlights the advanced nature and extensive impact of the cyberattack on the SingHealth patient database. This implies that the attack was complex, difficult to detect, and affected a very large number of individuals and sensitive data types."
What is the difference between data being 'accessed' and 'exfiltrated' in the context of the breach?,"In the context of the breach, data was ""illegally accessed"" between August 23, 2017, and July 20, 2018, meaning the attackers gained unauthorized entry and viewed the data. ""Exfiltrated"" specifically refers to the unauthorized transfer of that data out of the SingHealth system, which occurred for personal particulars and medication records between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018. So, access is about viewing, while exfiltration is about removing the data."
How did the attacker's actions evolve from initial access to compromising the SCM system?,"The attacker's actions evolved significantly. Initial access was gained around August 23, 2017, by infecting front-end workstations, likely through phishing attacks. Following this, the attacker lay dormant for 4 months. Then, from December 2017 to June 2018, they engaged in lateral movement and privilege escalation, compromising numerous endpoints, servers, and user/administrator accounts. This included compromising Citrix servers in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database. Starting May 2018, they used compromised workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to these SGH Citrix servers, ultimately leading to the compromise of the SCM system on June 26, 2018. ""SCM"" is an electronic medical records software solution."
