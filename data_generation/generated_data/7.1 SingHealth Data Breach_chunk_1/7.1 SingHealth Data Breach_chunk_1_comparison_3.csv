Compare the roles of SingHealth and Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) concerning the SCM system during the cyberattack.,"During the cyberattack, SingHealth owned the SCM system. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) was responsible for administering and operating the SCM system, including implementing cybersecurity measures. IHIS was also responsible for security incident response and reporting."
What are the differences in the exfiltration of general patient personal particulars and the Prime Minister's data during the SingHealth cyberattack?,"During the SingHealth cyberattack, personal particulars of 1.5 million patients, including names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, were exfiltrated. Around 159,000 of these patients also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. In contrast, the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed."
Compare the initial access phase with the lateral movement phase of the SingHealth cyberattack.,"The initial access phase of the SingHealth cyberattack occurred around August 23, 2017, when the attacker gained access to SingHealth's IT network by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. Following this, the attacker lay dormant for four months before commencing the lateral movement phase. This lateral movement, which lasted for six months between December 2017 and June 2018, involved compromising many endpoints and servers within the network, including the Citrix servers located in SGH that were connected to the SCM database. During this phase, a large number of user and administrator accounts were also compromised."
Compare the function of the SCM database with that of Citrix servers within the SingHealth SCM system.,"The SCM database is the core repository for the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. The SCM system is an electronic medical records software solution that allows healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. Citrix servers, on the other hand, operate as an intermediary between front-end workstations and the SCM database. Users access the SCM database via these Citrix servers. The Citrix servers played a critical role in the cyberattack."
Compare the roles of a user workstation and the Citrix Farm in the normal SingHealth user authentication process to access the SCM Database.,"In the normal SingHealth user authentication process to access the SCM Database, a user workstation is where users initiate the process by launching the SCM via CITRIX. The Citrix Farm, comprising CITRIX SERVERs (SCM CLIENTs), receives the user's request from the workstation. It then sends the user's credentials to the SCM Security Server for authentication. After successful authentication, the Citrix Farm facilitates the user's login and allows them to start using SCM."
Compare the roles of the SCM Security Server and the SCM Database during the user authentication process for the SCM system.,"During the user authentication process for the SCM system, the SCM Security Server receives user credentials from the Citrix Farm for authentication. Once the credentials are authenticated, the SCM Database, which contains the patient electronic medical records, becomes accessible to the authenticated user. The SCM Security Server is responsible for verifying the user's identity, while the SCM Database is the data repository that the user ultimately aims to access."
Compare the timeframe of the data exfiltration with the overall duration of the cyberattack on SingHealth.,"The overall cyberattack on the SingHealth patient database occurred between August 23, 2017, and July 20, 2018. In contrast, the data exfiltration, where personal particulars were illegally accessed and removed, took place over a shorter, specific period from June 27, 2018, to July 4, 2018."
Compare the role of phishing attacks with remote connection in the attacker's methods during the SingHealth cyberattack.,"Phishing attacks were the likely method for the attacker to gain initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, by infecting front-end workstations. Remote connection, on the other hand, was a method used later in the attack, starting from May 2018. The attacker utilized compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines within the SingHealth IT network to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers, which were critical for accessing the SCM database."
"Compare the ""Compromised SCM"" event (step 3) with the ""Queried SCM Database"" event (step 4) in the cyberattack workflow diagram.","In the cyberattack workflow, ""Compromised SCM"" (step 3), which occurred on June 26, 2018, indicates that the attacker had gained control or access to the SCM system, likely through the compromised Citrix servers. This event is a prerequisite for the subsequent action. ""Queried SCM Database"" (step 4), which took place between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018, represents the actual interaction with the SCM Database to retrieve information, following the compromise of the SCM system. This querying led directly to the data exfiltration."
"Compare the data transfer events labeled ""5a"" and ""5b"" in the cyberattack workflow diagram.","Both data transfer events, ""5a"" and ""5b,"" represent data exfiltration that occurred between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018. Event ""5a"" shows data being transferred directly from the SCM DB Servers, specifically the ""Medical Records,"" via CITRIX Server 2 @SGH. Event ""5b"" shows data being transferred from Healthcare Institution A, specifically from Workstation A, also during the same period. This suggests multiple points or paths for data exfiltration were utilized by the attacker."
Compare the roles of front-end workstations and the SCM database as components of the SingHealth SCM system.,"The SingHealth SCM system is described as comprising front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database. Front-end workstations are the user-facing devices from which healthcare staff or users initiate access to the SCM system. The SCM database, on the other hand, is the backend repository that holds the patient electronic medical records, which are the ""crown jewels"" of the network. Users interact with the SCM system via workstations, with the ultimate goal of accessing or managing data stored in the SCM database."
"Compare the ""Initial entry"" (step 1) with ""Lateral movement & privilege escalation"" (step 2) in the cyberattack workflow.","""Initial entry"" (step 1) marks the beginning of the cyberattack, occurring on August 23, 2017, where the attacker first gained access to a system, specifically Workstation A in Healthcare Institution A. ""Lateral movement & privilege escalation"" (step 2), which took place from December 2017 to June 2018, describes the attacker's subsequent actions to move deeper into the network from the initial point of compromise and gain higher levels of access. This phase involved spreading from Healthcare Institution A to Healthcare Institution B and compromising various systems, including Citrix servers."
Compare the SCM system with the SCM database in the context of SingHealth's operations.,"The SCM system is an electronic medical records software solution that allows healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. It is described as comprising front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database. The SCM database, specifically, is the component within the SCM system that contains the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. Therefore, the SCM system is the broader solution, and the SCM database is a critical component within that system, serving as the data repository."
"Compare ""User Credential sent to SCM Security for authentication"" (step 2) with ""Authenticated"" (step 3) in the SingHealth user authentication process.","In the SingHealth user authentication process, ""User Credential sent to SCM Security for authentication"" (step 2) is the action where the Citrix Farm transmits the user's login information to the SCM Security Server for verification. ""Authenticated"" (step 3) is the outcome of this verification process, indicating that the SCM Security Server has successfully validated the user's credentials, thereby granting them permission to proceed with accessing the SCM system."
"Compare the ""SingHealth patient database"" mentioned in the crisis overview with the ""SCM database"" described as the crown jewels.","The ""SingHealth patient database"" is the general term used to describe the target of the cyberattack, where personal particulars of 1.5 million patients were illegally accessed and exfiltrated. The ""SCM database"" is specifically identified as the repository of the patient electronic medical records, which are considered the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network. It is highly probable that the ""SingHealth patient database"" refers to or primarily includes the ""SCM database"" given its critical role and the nature of the data exfiltrated. The SCM database is a component of the SCM system, an electronic medical records software solution."
Compare the types of patient data exfiltrated: personal particulars versus outpatient dispensed medication records.,"During the SingHealth cyberattack, personal particulars of 1.5 million patients were exfiltrated. This data included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. In addition to these personal particulars, around 159,000 of these 1.5 million patients also had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated. This indicates that while personal identifiers were broadly compromised, medication history was a more specific subset of data exfiltrated for a smaller, though still significant, number of patients."
"Compare the meaning of ""Attacker's movement to SCM DB Server"" with ""Flow of data exfiltration"" as depicted in the cyberattack workflow legend.","In the cyberattack workflow legend, ""Attacker's movement to SCM DB Server"" (represented by a solid black arrow) indicates the path the attacker took to gain access to or control over the SCM database servers. This signifies the attacker's internal navigation and compromise of systems. ""Flow of data exfiltration"" (represented by a red arrow) indicates the direction and path through which the stolen data was transferred out of the SingHealth network, typically to the attacker's control, often via the Internet. The former describes the attacker's access path, while the latter describes the data's exit path."
"Compare the use of ""compromised user workstations"" with ""suspected virtual machines"" by the attacker for remote connection to SGH Citrix servers.","Starting from May 2018, the attacker made use of both compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines within the SingHealth IT network. Compromised user workstations are physical or virtual machines used by legitimate users that have been taken over by the attacker. Suspected virtual machines are virtualized computing environments that the attacker likely controlled or used as a pivot point. Both were leveraged to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers, which were crucial for accessing the SCM database."
"Compare the description of the SCM database as ""crown jewels"" with the SCM system as an ""electronic medical records software solution.""","The SCM database is described as the ""crown jewels"" of the SingHealth network because it contains the patient electronic medical records, which are the most valuable and sensitive data. This highlights its critical importance and the severe impact of its compromise. The SCM system, on the other hand, is defined as an ""electronic medical records software solution"" that enables healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. This describes its functional purpose and broader architecture, which includes the database, Citrix servers, and front-end workstations. The ""crown jewels"" refers to the valuable data within a component, while ""software solution"" refers to the entire operational system."
"Compare the ""scale"" and ""sophistication"" of the SingHealth cyberattack.","The SingHealth cyberattack is described as being of ""unprecedented scale & sophistication."" The ""scale"" refers to the vast number of individuals affected, with personal particulars of 1.5 million patients exfiltrated, including outpatient medication records for 159,000 of them, and the specific targeting of the Prime Minister's data. The ""sophistication"" refers to the advanced nature of the attack methods and the attacker's ability to remain dormant for months, perform lateral movement, compromise numerous endpoints and accounts, and strategically use components like Citrix servers to access the ""crown jewels"" SCM database."
Compare the roles of Healthcare Institution A and Healthcare Institution B in the cyberattack workflow diagram.,"In the cyberattack workflow diagram, Healthcare Institution A is depicted as the location of the ""Initial entry"" (step 1) on August 23, 2017, specifically via Workstation A. This suggests it was the initial point of compromise. Healthcare Institution B is shown later in the workflow, where ""Lateral movement & privilege escalation"" (step 2) occurred from December 2017 to June 2018, leading to the ""Compromised SCM"" (step 3) via Workstation B. This indicates that the attacker moved from Institution A to Institution B as part of their network infiltration."
Compare the duration of the attacker's dormant period with the duration of the lateral movement phase during the SingHealth cyberattack.,"After gaining initial access around August 23, 2017, the attacker lay dormant for four months. Following this dormant period, the attacker commenced lateral movement, which lasted for six months, from December 2017 to June 2018. This shows that the period of active network exploration and compromise (lateral movement) was longer than the initial period of inactivity after the initial breach."
Compare the types of personal particulars exfiltrated with the outpatient dispensed medication records.,"The personal particulars exfiltrated from 1.5 million patients included names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. Outpatient dispensed medication records, which were exfiltrated for around 159,000 of these patients, represent a more specific and sensitive category of health information, detailing the medications prescribed and dispensed to individuals. While both are personal data, medication records provide insight into an individual's health status, whereas the other particulars are primarily identifying information."
Compare SCM system ownership with administration/operation responsibility.,"At the time of the cyberattack, SingHealth owned the SCM system. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS), however, was responsible for administering and operating the system. This responsibility included implementing cybersecurity measures, as well as security incident response and reporting. This indicates a separation of ownership from the day-to-day management and security responsibilities."
Compare the normal user authentication process to access the SCM Database with the attacker's method of accessing the SCM Database during the cyberattack.,"The normal user authentication process involves users launching SCM via CITRIX from a user workstation. User credentials are then sent to the SCM Security Server for authentication via the Citrix Farm. Upon authentication, users successfully log in and start using SCM. In contrast, the attacker's method involved gaining initial access through phishing attacks on front-end workstations, followed by a dormant period, then lateral movement and privilege escalation to compromise Citrix servers and user/administrator accounts. Starting May 2018, the attacker used compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers, ultimately querying the SCM Database for data exfiltration. The attacker bypassed or exploited the normal authentication mechanisms after compromising critical components."
"Compare the role of the ""CITRIX SERVER (SCM CLIENT)"" within the Citrix Farm with the ""SCM SECURITY SERVER"" within the SCM Servers in the user authentication process.","In the SingHealth user authentication process, the ""CITRIX SERVER (SCM CLIENT)"" within the Citrix Farm acts as an intermediary, receiving the user's SCM launch request from the user workstation and then forwarding the user's credentials to the SCM Security Server. The ""SCM SECURITY SERVER"" within the SCM Servers is responsible for receiving these user credentials and performing the actual authentication. Once authentication is successful, the SCM Security Server signals back, allowing the user to proceed. Essentially, the Citrix Server facilitates the connection and credential transfer, while the SCM Security Server performs the critical authentication check."
Compare the date of the initial entry of the cyberattack with the start date of data exfiltration.,"The initial entry of the cyberattack into SingHealth's IT network occurred around August 23, 2017. The data exfiltration, however, commenced much later, starting on June 27, 2018. This shows a significant gap of over ten months between the attacker's initial breach and the actual extraction of data."
"Compare the ""SCM DB Servers"" with ""Medical Records"" as depicted in the cyberattack workflow diagram.","In the cyberattack workflow diagram, ""SCM DB Servers"" represents the physical or virtual servers hosting the SCM database. The ""Medical Records"" label, positioned directly above the SCM DB Servers, specifically highlights the sensitive patient data contained within those servers. Therefore, SCM DB Servers are the infrastructure, and Medical Records are the critical data residing on that infrastructure, which was the ultimate target of the exfiltration."
Compare the overall timeline of the SingHealth cyberattack with the specific timeline for data exfiltration.,"The overall SingHealth cyberattack, from initial breach to its conclusion, spanned a period from August 23, 2017, to July 20, 2018. The illegal access and exfiltration of personal particulars, however, occurred within a much narrower window during this overall period, specifically from June 27, 2018, to July 4, 2018. This indicates that while the attacker was present in the network for nearly a year, the actual data theft happened over a concentrated week-long period."
"Compare the event ""Compromised SCM"" (step 3) with the entity ""CITRIX Server 1 @SGH"" in the cyberattack workflow.","""Compromised SCM"" (step 3), dated June 26, 2018, is an event indicating that the attacker successfully gained control or access to the SCM system. ""CITRIX Server 1 @SGH"" is one of the specific Citrix servers located at SGH that was compromised as part of the attack. The diagram shows a connection from ""Compromised SCM"" to ""CITRIX Server 1 @SGH,"" implying that the compromise of the SCM system likely involved or leveraged these specific Citrix servers, which were critical intermediaries to the SCM database."
"Compare the ""USER PC"" with the ""SCM SERVERS"" in the SingHealth user authentication process diagram.","In the SingHealth user authentication process, the ""USER PC"" represents the individual user's workstation from which they initiate access to the SCM system by launching SCM via CITRIX. The ""SCM SERVERS"" represent the backend infrastructure that hosts the SCM Security Server and the SCM Database. The USER PC is the client-side endpoint, while the SCM SERVERS are the server-side components responsible for authentication and data storage."
"Compare IHIS's responsibility for ""administering and operating the system"" with its responsibility for ""implementing cybersecurity measures.""","Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) was responsible for both administering and operating the SCM system, and implementing cybersecurity measures. Administering and operating the system refers to the day-to-day management, maintenance, and ensuring the functionality of the SCM system. Implementing cybersecurity measures is a specific subset of this responsibility, focusing on the security aspects to protect the system and its data from threats like cyberattacks. Both are crucial roles for IHIS in managing the SCM system."
Compare the general role of Citrix servers in the SCM system with their specific role in the cyberattack.,"In the general SCM system, Citrix servers operate as an intermediary, allowing users to access the SCM database from front-end workstations. They are a normal part of the system's architecture for real-time patient data access. In the cyberattack, however, the Citrix servers played a critical role as a point of compromise. The attacker specifically targeted and compromised these servers (e.g., Citrix servers located in SGH) during the lateral movement phase, and later used compromised workstations to remotely connect to them, leveraging them to query and exfiltrate data from the SCM database."
"Compare ""Data exfiltration"" (step 6) with ""Data transferred"" (steps 5a and 5b) in the cyberattack workflow diagram.","In the cyberattack workflow diagram, ""Data transferred"" (steps 5a and 5b), both occurring between June 27, 2018, and July 4, 2018, represent the specific actions of moving data out of the SCM DB Servers (5a) and Workstation A (5b). ""Data exfiltration"" (step 6), occurring during the same period, is the overarching term for the successful unauthorized transfer of data out of the SingHealth network, often via the Internet. Therefore, ""Data transferred"" describes the specific internal movements or initial stages of data egress, while ""Data exfiltration"" describes the final, successful removal of data from the network."
Compare the general cyberattack on the SingHealth patient database with the specific targeting of the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data.,"The cyberattack was broadly carried out on the SingHealth patient database, resulting in the illegal access and exfiltration of personal particulars of 1.5 million patients. This represents a wide-scale compromise. In contrast, the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed. This indicates a focused and deliberate effort by the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information belonging to a particular high-profile individual, distinguishing it from the broader, albeit massive, data breach."
"Compare the ""SCM database"" with ""patient electronic medical records"" in the context of the SingHealth network.","The ""SCM database"" is the physical or logical repository within the SingHealth network. It is described as containing the ""patient electronic medical records."" These ""patient electronic medical records"" are the actual data—the sensitive health information and personal particulars—that reside within the SCM database. The SCM database is the container, and the patient electronic medical records are the valuable contents, which are referred to as the ""crown jewels"" due to their critical importance."
Compare the method of initial access (phishing attacks) with the later method of remote connection via compromised user workstations used by the attacker.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, primarily by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. Phishing attacks involve deceiving users into revealing credentials or installing malware. Later in the attack, starting from May 2018, the attacker used compromised user workstations (which may have been initially infected via phishing or other means) and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers. This indicates a progression from an initial social engineering/malware-based entry to leveraging already compromised internal assets for further network navigation and access."
Compare SingHealth's role in SCM system ownership with IHIS's responsibility for security incident response.,"SingHealth's role was that of ownership of the SCM system at the time of the cyberattack. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS), on the other hand, was specifically responsible for security incident response and reporting. This means SingHealth held the asset, while IHIS was tasked with managing and reacting to security breaches and reporting on them."
"Compare the SCM system's definition as an ""electronic medical records software solution"" with its function of ""allowing healthcare staff to access real-time patient data.""","The SCM system is defined as an ""electronic medical records software solution,"" which describes its fundamental nature as a technological platform designed for managing medical records. Its function of ""allowing healthcare staff to access real-time patient data"" is the primary purpose and benefit derived from this software solution. The definition describes what it is, while the function describes what it does for its users."
"Compare ""Users launch SCM via CITRIX at User PC"" (step 1) with ""Users successfully log in and start using SCM"" (step 4) in the SingHealth user authentication process.","In the SingHealth user authentication process, ""Users launch SCM via CITRIX at User PC"" (step 1) is the initial action taken by a user from their workstation to begin the process of accessing the SCM system. ""Users successfully log in and start using SCM"" (step 4) is the final outcome of the authentication process, indicating that all intermediate steps (credential submission, authentication) have been completed successfully, and the user now has active access to the SCM system."
Compare the scope of the cyberattack on the SingHealth patient database with the specific exfiltration of outpatient dispensed medication records.,"The cyberattack was carried out on the SingHealth patient database, which involved the illegal access and exfiltration of personal particulars of 1.5 million patients. This represents the broad scope of the breach. The exfiltration of outpatient dispensed medication records, affecting around 159,000 of these 1.5 million patients, is a more specific subset of the data compromised. While the entire database was targeted, medication records were a distinct category of sensitive health information that was also specifically extracted for a significant portion of the affected patients."
"Compare the ""CITRIX FARM"" with the ""SCM SERVERS"" in the SingHealth user authentication process diagram.","In the SingHealth user authentication process, the ""CITRIX FARM"" consists of multiple CITRIX SERVERs (SCM CLIENTs) that act as an intermediary layer. Its role is to receive user requests from workstations, forward credentials for authentication, and facilitate the user's connection to the SCM system. The ""SCM SERVERS,"" on the other hand, are the backend servers that host the SCM Security Server (for authentication) and the SCM Database (for data storage). The Citrix Farm handles the user-facing connection and routing, while the SCM Servers handle the core security and data management functions."
What are the differences between the attacker's dormant period and the lateral movement period during the SingHealth cyberattack?,"After gaining initial access around August 23, 2017, the attacker lay dormant for four months, meaning there was a period of inactivity or stealth within the network. Following this, the attacker commenced lateral movement, which lasted for six months, from December 2017 to June 2018. During the lateral movement period, the attacker was actively compromising many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers, and compromising user and administrator accounts, indicating active reconnaissance and expansion of control within the network."
Compare SingHealth's ownership of the SCM system with IHIS's responsibility for implementing cybersecurity measures for the system.,"SingHealth owned the SCM system at the time of the cyberattack, meaning they held proprietary rights and ultimate accountability for the system. Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHIS) was responsible for implementing cybersecurity measures for the SCM system. This indicates that while SingHealth was the owner, the practical execution of security protocols and defenses was delegated to IHIS."
Compare the general personal particulars exfiltrated from 1.5 million patients with the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data.,"Personal particulars of 1.5 million patients, including names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, were exfiltrated as part of the broad cyberattack. The Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data, while falling under the umbrella of personal particulars and medication records, was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed. This distinction highlights that while a large volume of general patient data was compromised, the Prime Minister's data was subject to a focused and persistent effort by the attackers, indicating its perceived higher value or specific interest."
"Compare the ""unprecedented scale"" with the ""unprecedented sophistication"" of the SingHealth cyberattack.","The ""unprecedented scale"" of the SingHealth cyberattack refers to the sheer volume of data and individuals affected, specifically the personal particulars of 1.5 million patients and the outpatient medication records of 159,000 patients. The ""unprecedented sophistication"" refers to the advanced techniques and planning employed by the attacker, including a dormant period, lateral movement, compromise of critical infrastructure like Citrix servers, and targeted access to specific high-profile data, demonstrating a high level of technical skill and strategic execution."
Compare the role of front-end workstations with Citrix servers as components of the SingHealth SCM system.,"The SingHealth SCM system comprises front-end workstations, Citrix servers, and the SCM database. Front-end workstations are the user-facing devices where healthcare staff access the SCM system. Citrix servers act as an intermediary layer, allowing users from these front-end workstations to connect to and access the SCM database. Essentially, workstations are the initial access points for users, while Citrix servers facilitate and manage that access to the core database."
Compare the date of the attacker's initial access to SingHealth's IT network with the date they started using remote connection to SGH Citrix servers.,"The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017. The attacker started making use of compromised user workstations and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to the SGH Citrix servers much later, starting from May 2018. This shows a significant time gap of over eight months between the initial breach and the commencement of this specific method for deeper access to critical systems."
"Compare the SCM database being the ""crown jewels"" with Citrix servers playing a ""critical role in the Cyber Attack.""","The SCM database is described as the ""crown jewels"" because it contains the patient electronic medical records, which are the most valuable and sensitive assets of the SingHealth network. This highlights its inherent value as the ultimate target. Citrix servers played a ""critical role in the Cyber Attack"" not because they contained the ""crown jewels"" themselves, but because they served as the essential intermediary that users (and thus attackers) needed to traverse to access the SCM database. Their compromise was a crucial step in the attacker's path to reach the valuable data."
Compare the overall duration of the SingHealth cyberattack with the duration of the lateral movement phase.,"The overall SingHealth cyberattack spanned from August 23, 2017, to July 20, 2018, which is approximately 11 months. The lateral movement phase, where the attacker actively compromised endpoints and servers within the network, lasted for six months, specifically from December 2017 to June 2018. This indicates that the lateral movement phase constituted a significant portion of the overall attack duration, following an initial dormant period."
Compare the number of patients whose personal particulars were exfiltrated with the number whose outpatient medication records were exfiltrated.,"Personal particulars, including names, NRIC numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, were exfiltrated for 1.5 million patients. Outpatient dispensed medication records, a more specific type of data, were exfiltrated for a subset of these patients, specifically around 159,000 of the 1.5 million affected individuals."
Compare the initial entry point (Workstation A) with the compromised SCM point (Workstation B) in the cyberattack workflow.,"The initial entry point (step 1) was Workstation A in Healthcare Institution A, occurring on August 23, 2017. This was the first point of compromise. The compromised SCM (step 3) occurred via Workstation B in Healthcare Institution B on June 26, 2018. This indicates that the attacker moved laterally from the initial entry point (Workstation A) to another workstation (Workstation B) in a different institution to further compromise the SCM system."
Compare the purpose of the SCM system (electronic medical records software solution) with the purpose of Citrix servers (intermediary access).,"The SCM system is an electronic medical records software solution whose primary purpose is to allow healthcare staff to access real-time patient data. Citrix servers, within this system, serve the purpose of acting as an intermediary. They facilitate the connection between front-end workstations, where users initiate access, and the SCM database, where the patient data resides. So, the SCM system is the overall solution for data management, while Citrix servers are a critical component for secure and managed access to that data."
Compare the general patient data exfiltration with the specific targeting of the Prime Minister's data.,"The cyberattack involved the exfiltration of personal particulars of 1.5 million patients, which represents a broad compromise of general patient data. In contrast, the Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medication data was specifically targeted and repeatedly accessed, indicating a deliberate and focused effort by the attackers to acquire information about a high-profile individual, rather than just a bulk data theft."
Compare the role of the Internet in the cyberattack workflow with the role of Citrix Servers.,"In the cyberattack workflow, the Internet (step 6) is depicted as the final egress point for data exfiltration, indicating how the stolen data left the SingHealth network. Citrix Servers (e.g., CITRIX Server 1 @SGH, CITRIX Server 2 @SGH) played a critical internal role. They were compromised (step 3) and used by the attacker to query the SCM Database (step 4) and transfer data (steps 5a, 5b) before it exited via the Internet. The Internet is the external conduit for exfiltration, while Citrix Servers were internal gateways exploited by the attacker."
Compare the initial access method (infecting front-end workstations) with the method for compromising user and administrator accounts.,"The initial access to SingHealth's IT network around August 23, 2017, was achieved by infecting front-end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. This was the entry vector. Later, during the lateral movement phase (December 2017 to June 2018), the attacker also compromised a large number of user and administrator accounts. While the initial infection of workstations provided a foothold, compromising accounts provided broader access and privileges within the network, enabling deeper penetration and control."
Compare the SCM database as the target of queries with the SCM DB Servers as the source of data transfer.,"The SCM database is the logical repository of patient electronic medical records that the attacker ""Queried"" (step 4) to retrieve information. The SCM DB Servers are the physical or virtual machines hosting this database, and they are depicted as the source from which ""Data transferred"" (step 5a) occurred. So, the database is the data itself being queried, and the servers are the infrastructure from which that data was physically extracted."
