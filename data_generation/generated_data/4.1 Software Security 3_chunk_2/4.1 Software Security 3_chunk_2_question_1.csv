"What characterizes a ""Safe Language"" or ""Strong Type"" language?","Safe languages, also known as strong type languages, are characterized by having automatic bounds checking and not permitting direct memory access. Examples include Ada, Perl, Python, Java, C#, and Visual Basic."
What are the key features and design principles of the Rust programming language?,"Rust, developed by Mozilla in 2010, is designed as a ""safe, concurrent, practical language."" It supports both functional and imperative-procedural programming paradigms. A key feature is that it does not permit null pointers, dangling pointers, or data races. Memory and other resources in Rust are managed through ""Resource Acquisition Is Initialization"" (RAII), which is a programming idiom used in object-oriented, statically-typed languages where resource acquisition is tied to object lifetime and deallocation to object destruction."
Describe the characteristics and typical applications of the Go programming language.,"Go is a type-safe, garbage-collected language that has a C-looking syntax. It features a good concurrency model, making it suitable for taking advantage of multicore machines. Consequently, Go is appropriate for implementing server architectures."
What is the importance of peer review in the context of manual code reviews for IT companies?,"Peer review is a very important step in manual code reviews, especially before shipping code in IT companies. It involves other developers examining the code to find defects and improve its quality."
"What types of ""wrong use of data"" issues are typically identified during a code review?","During a code review, ""wrong use of data"" issues can include a variable not being initialized, the presence of a dangling pointer, or an array index being out of bounds.\n\nA **dangling pointer** is a pointer that does not point to a valid object of the appropriate type, often because the memory it pointed to has been deallocated. An **array index out of bounds** occurs when a program tries to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array."
"What are common ""faults in declarations"" that a code review checklist aims to catch?","Common ""faults in declarations"" identified during a code review include an undeclared variable, meaning a variable is used without being formally defined, or a variable being declared twice, which can lead to compilation errors or unexpected behavior."
"What kinds of ""faults in computation"" are addressed in a code review checklist?","""Faults in computation"" that a code review checklist aims to address include division by zero, which causes runtime errors; mixed-type expressions, where operations are performed on incompatible data types; and wrong operator priorities, leading to incorrect calculation results."
"What are examples of ""faults in relational expressions"" found during code reviews?","""Faults in relational expressions"" that can be identified during code reviews include the use of an incorrect Boolean operator or wrong operator priorities within conditional statements, which can lead to logic errors and incorrect program flow."
"What constitutes ""faults in control flow"" according to a code review checklist?","""Faults in control flow"" refer to issues such as infinite loops, where a loop never terminates, or loops that execute an incorrect number of times, for example, 'n-1' or 'n+1' times instead of the intended 'n' times, leading to incorrect program behavior or resource exhaustion."
What is the purpose of unit tests in software development?,"Unit tests are designed to test individual components or functions of the software in isolation. Their purpose is to ensure that each unit of the code works as expected. Unit tests should aim to cover all code, including error handling mechanisms."
Explain the role of regression tests in software quality assurance.,"Regression tests are used to verify that new code changes do not negatively affect existing functionality. They ensure that the software continues to function correctly after updates, modifications, or bug fixes have been applied."
What is the primary objective of integration tests?,"The primary objective of integration tests is to test the interaction between multiple software modules or systems. They ensure that these components work together as expected when combined, rather than just individually."
What is static analysis in software development?,"Static analysis is a method of analyzing the source code or binary of a program before it is run, typically during compilation. It involves examining the code without executing it to find potential issues."
What are the main purposes of performing static analysis?,"The main purposes of performing static analysis include exploring all possible execution consequences with all possible inputs, approximating all possible states of the program, and identifying issues during development to reduce the cost of fixing vulnerabilities. It relies on predefined rules or policies to identify patterns of insecure coding practices."
Can you list some examples of static analysis tools?,"Examples of static analysis tools include Coverity (https://scan.coverity.com/), Fortify (https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/cyberres/application-security), and GrammarTech (https://www.grammatech.com/)."
What are the limitations of static analysis?,"The limitations of static analysis include its potential to produce false positives, which then require manual review to confirm if they are actual issues. Additionally, static analysis cannot detect runtime issues such as logical errors or dynamic environment-specific flaws, as it does not execute the code."
What is Dynamic Analysis: Penetration Testing?,Dynamic Analysis: Penetration Testing is a proactive security assessment method. It involves simulating attacks on a system to identify weaknesses that are exploitable.
What are the key goals of penetration testing?,"The key goals of penetration testing are to identify vulnerabilities before attackers do, simulate attacks on a system to identify its exploitable weaknesses, and ensure compliance with security regulations while improving the overall security posture of systems and applications."
What is the first step in the general procedure for penetration testing?,The first step in the general procedure for penetration testing is to test the system with tools. This involves using specialized software to probe the system for potential vulnerabilities.
"After testing the system with tools, what is the next step in penetration testing?","After testing the system with tools, the next step in penetration testing is to interpret the testing results. This involves analyzing the output from the tools to understand what vulnerabilities or weaknesses might exist."
"What is the final step in the general procedure for penetration testing, following interpretation of results?","Following the interpretation of testing results, the final step in the general procedure for penetration testing is to check exploitability. If a weakness is found to be exploitable, an exploit may be developed. If not, the process may loop back to step 1 (testing the system with tools) or step 2 (interpreting results) to gather more information or try different approaches.\n\n**Exploitability** refers to the potential for a vulnerability to be successfully leveraged by an attacker to compromise a system."
What is fuzzing in the context of dynamic analysis?,"Fuzzing is an automated and scalable approach to test software at runtime. It involves bombarding a program with random, corrupted, or unexpected data to identify how it behaves under such conditions."
How does fuzzing work to identify software vulnerabilities?,"Fuzzing works by bombarding a program with random, corrupted, or unexpected data. It then observes the program for crashes, memory issues, or other unexpected behaviors. Finally, it examines these failures to determine if they represent exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nAn **exploitable vulnerability** is a flaw in a system that can be taken advantage of by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or cause unintended behavior."
Name some software testing tools based on fuzzing.,"Some software testing tools based on fuzzing include AFL (https://github.com/google/AFL), FOT (https://sites.google.com/view/fot-the-fuzzer), and Peach (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Fuzzing/Peach)."
What are the limitations of fuzzing as a software testing technique?,"The limitations of fuzzing include limited code coverage, meaning it may not reach all parts of the code. It also often requires expert analysis to assess whether system crashes identified are actually exploitable vulnerabilities. Furthermore, fuzzing may miss logic flaws that do not result in crashes, as its primary detection mechanism is based on observing program failures."
Describe the mutation-based fuzzing technique.,"Mutation-based fuzzing involves collecting a corpus of existing inputs and then perturbing these inputs randomly. Perturbations can include bit flips, integer increments, or substituting values with small, large, or negative integers. This technique is simple to set up and can be used effectively for off-the-shelf software.\n\nA **corpus of inputs** refers to a collection of valid or typical input data used as a starting point for testing."
Explain the generation-based fuzzing technique.,"Generation-based fuzzing converts a specification of the input format into a generative procedure. It then generates test cases according to this procedure, often with perturbations. This technique leverages knowledge of the input format to achieve higher coverage. However, it requires a significant amount of effort to set up and is typically domain-specific."
What is coverage-guided fuzzing and how does it work?,"Coverage-guided fuzzing uses traditional fuzzing strategies to create new test cases. It tests the program and measures the code coverage, then uses this code coverage as feedback to craft new inputs specifically for uncovered code. This technique is good at finding new states and combines well with other solutions.\n\n**Code coverage** is a metric that describes the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs."
Which programming languages are mentioned as having automatic bounds checking and no direct memory access?,"Ada, Perl, Python, Java, C#, and Visual Basic are mentioned as programming languages that have automatic bounds checking and do not have direct memory access.\n\n**Automatic bounds checking** is a feature where the system automatically verifies that array accesses or other memory operations stay within their allocated boundaries, preventing out-of-bounds errors. **Direct memory access** refers to the ability of a program to directly read from or write to specific memory addresses, which can be powerful but also a source of vulnerabilities if not handled carefully."
How does Rust manage memory and other resources?,"Rust manages memory and other resources through ""Resource Acquisition Is Initialization"" (RAII).\n\n**RAII** is a programming idiom where resource acquisition (like memory allocation or file opening) is tied to object initialization, and resource deallocation is tied to object destruction, ensuring resources are properly managed throughout an object's lifetime."
What is a notable feature of Go regarding its concurrency model?,"Go has a good concurrency model that is designed for taking advantage of multicore machines. This makes it efficient for tasks that can be broken down into independent, simultaneously executing parts."
Why is the Go language considered appropriate for implementing server architectures?,"The Go language is considered appropriate for implementing server architectures primarily because of its good concurrency model, which allows it to efficiently utilize multicore machines, a common requirement for high-performance server applications."
What are the main categories of issues covered by a code review checklist?,"A code review checklist covers main categories of issues including wrong use of data, faults in declarations, faults in computation, faults in relational expressions, and faults in control flow."
What are the three main types of software tests discussed?,"The three main types of software tests discussed are Unit tests, Regression tests, and Integration tests."
What aspect of code should unit tests specifically cover in addition to individual components?,"In addition to testing individual components or functions, unit tests should specifically cover all code, including error handling mechanisms, to ensure that the software behaves correctly when errors occur."
How do regression tests help verify software functionality after updates?,"Regression tests help verify software functionality after updates by ensuring that the software continues to function correctly, thereby confirming that new code changes have not negatively affected existing functionality."
What is the goal of integration tests regarding software components?,The goal of integration tests regarding software components is to ensure that multiple software modules or systems work together as expected when they interact.
When does static analysis typically occur in the software development lifecycle?,"Static analysis typically occurs during compilation, analyzing the source code or binary before the program is run."
How does static analysis help reduce the cost of fixing vulnerabilities?,"Static analysis helps reduce the cost of fixing vulnerabilities by identifying issues early during the development phase, before the code is deployed or even fully tested dynamically."
What does static analysis rely on to identify insecure coding practices?,Static analysis relies on predefined rules or policies to identify patterns of insecure coding practices. These rules are used to flag potential vulnerabilities or deviations from coding standards.
What is a common drawback of static analysis related to its findings?,"A common drawback of static analysis is that it may produce false positives, which are reported issues that are not actual defects. These false positives then require manual review to distinguish them from genuine problems."
What types of issues can static analysis not detect?,"Static analysis cannot detect runtime issues, such as logical errors or dynamic environment-specific flaws, because it analyzes the code without executing it."
"Why is penetration testing considered a ""proactive"" security assessment method?","Penetration testing is considered a ""proactive"" security assessment method because it aims to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a system by simulating attacks before malicious attackers can exploit them."
How does penetration testing contribute to compliance with security regulations?,"Penetration testing contributes to compliance with security regulations by identifying vulnerabilities that could lead to non-compliance and by improving the overall security posture of systems and applications, thereby helping organizations meet regulatory requirements."
What kind of data does fuzzing use to test software under unexpected conditions?,"Fuzzing uses random, corrupted, or unexpected data to test software under unexpected conditions, observing how the program behaves when confronted with inputs it might not be designed to handle gracefully."
What is the ultimate goal when examining failures observed during fuzzing?,"The ultimate goal when examining failures observed during fuzzing is to determine if these failures represent exploitable vulnerabilities, meaning flaws that an attacker could leverage for malicious purposes."
For what type of software is mutation-based fuzzing particularly suitable?,"Mutation-based fuzzing is particularly suitable for off-the-shelf software because it is simple to set up and does not require prior knowledge of the input format, as it perturbs existing inputs."
Why is generation-based fuzzing often considered domain-specific?,"Generation-based fuzzing is often considered domain-specific because it requires converting a specification of the input format into a generative procedure, which means it needs detailed knowledge of the specific domain's input structure. This makes it less general-purpose than mutation-based approaches."
What is an advantage of coverage-guided fuzzing in terms of program states?,"An advantage of coverage-guided fuzzing is that it is good at finding new states within the program. By using code coverage as feedback, it intelligently crafts inputs to explore parts of the code that have not yet been executed, thereby uncovering new execution paths and states."
How does coverage-guided fuzzing interact with other testing solutions?,"Coverage-guided fuzzing is noted for combining well with other solutions, suggesting its adaptability and effectiveness can be enhanced when integrated into a broader testing strategy."
