"Define ""Safe Language (Strong Type)"" and provide examples.","Safe languages (Strong Type) are programming languages characterized by automatic bounds checking and the absence of direct memory access. Examples of such languages include Ada, Perl, Python, Java, C#, and Visual Basic."
Describe the key characteristics and features of the Rust programming language.,"Rust, developed by Mozilla in 2010, is designed as a ""safe, concurrent, practical language."" It supports both functional and imperative-procedural programming paradigms. A key feature is its prevention of null pointers, dangling pointers, and data races.

"Describe the methodology and characteristics of ""Mutation-based fuzzing.""","Mutation-based fuzzing involves collecting a corpus of existing inputs that explores as many states as possible. It then perturbs these inputs randomly, potentially guided by heuristics such as bit flips, integer increments, or substituting values with small, large, or negative integers. This technique is simple to set up and can be effectively used for off-the-shelf software."
"Explain the approach and requirements of ""Generation-based fuzzing.""","Generation-based fuzzing involves converting a specification of the input format into a generative procedure. It then generates test cases according to this procedure, incorporating perturbations. This approach aims to achieve higher coverage by leveraging explicit knowledge of the input format, but it requires significant effort to set up and is typically domain-specific."
"What is ""Coverage-guided fuzzing"" and how does it operate?",Coverage-guided fuzzing utilizes traditional fuzzing strategies to create new test cases. It operates by testing the program and measuring the code coverage achieved. This code coverage data is then used as feedback to intelligently craft new inputs that target and explore uncovered code paths. This technique is effective at finding new states and integrates well with other testing solutions.
