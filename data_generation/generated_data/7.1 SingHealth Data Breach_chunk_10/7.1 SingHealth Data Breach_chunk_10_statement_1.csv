What is Recommendation #4 regarding security?,"Recommendation #4 states that enhanced security checks must be performed, especially on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems. CII systems are essential assets whose disruption could have a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, or safety."
"What specific actions are required for enhanced security checks, particularly on CII systems?","For enhanced security checks, especially on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, the following actions are required: vulnerability assessments must be conducted regularly, safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products must be carried out where feasible, penetration testing must be conducted regularly, red teaming should be carried out periodically, and threat hunting must be considered."
Explain the role of vulnerability assessments in enhanced security checks.,Vulnerability assessments are a critical component of enhanced security checks. They involve systematically identifying and quantifying security weaknesses in a system or network. These assessments must be conducted regularly to proactively discover and address potential points of exploitation before they can be leveraged by attackers.
"Why are safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products important for enhanced security?","Safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products are important for enhanced security because they ensure that third-party components and software integrated into an organization's systems meet established security standards and do not introduce new vulnerabilities. These processes must be carried out where feasible to mitigate risks associated with supply chain security."
What is penetration testing and how often should it be performed according to Recommendation #4?,"Penetration testing, often referred to as pen testing, is a simulated cyberattack against a computer system, network, or web application to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. According to Recommendation #4, penetration testing must be conducted regularly to identify and address security weaknesses from an attacker's perspective."
What is red teaming in the context of enhanced security checks?,"Red teaming, in the context of enhanced security checks, involves a simulated attack by a dedicated team (the ""red team"") that mimics the tactics, techniques, and procedures of real-world adversaries. The goal is to test the effectiveness of an organization's security defenses and incident response capabilities. Red teaming should be carried out periodically."
What is threat hunting and why should it be considered for enhanced security?,"Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity activity where security analysts actively search for threats that are undetected by automated security tools. Unlike traditional security measures that react to alerts, threat hunting assumes that a breach may have already occurred or that sophisticated threats are present. It must be considered for enhanced security to identify and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other stealthy attacks."
What types of systems are specifically highlighted for enhanced security checks?,"Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems are specifically highlighted for enhanced security checks. CII systems are essential assets whose disruption could have a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, or safety, thus requiring particular attention to their security posture."
What is Recommendation #5 about?,"Recommendation #5 states that privileged administrator accounts must be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring. This is crucial because these accounts possess elevated permissions that, if compromised, could lead to significant security breaches."
What is the purpose of creating an inventory of administrative accounts?,"An inventory of administrative accounts should be created to facilitate the rationalisation of such accounts. Rationalisation involves reviewing, consolidating, and optimizing the number and usage of administrative accounts to reduce the attack surface and improve manageability."
What authentication method is mandated for administrators performing administrative tasks?,"All administrators must use two-factor authentication (2FA) when performing administrative tasks. Two-factor authentication is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity, typically something they know (like a password) and something they have (like a token or smartphone). This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if one factor is compromised."
What alternative to passwords should be considered to reduce account compromise risk?,"The use of passphrases instead of passwords should be considered to reduce the risk of accounts being compromised. Passphrases are typically longer and more complex than traditional passwords, making them harder to guess or crack, while often being easier for users to remember."
What is required regarding password policies for both domain and local accounts?,"Password policies must be implemented and enforced across both domain and local accounts. These policies define rules for creating strong passwords, such as minimum length, complexity requirements (e.g., use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), and expiration periods, to enhance account security."
How should server local administrator accounts be managed?,"Server local administrator accounts must be centrally managed across the IT network. Centralized management ensures consistent application of security policies, easier monitoring, and streamlined access control, reducing the risk of orphaned or unmanaged privileged accounts."
What is the requirement for service accounts with high privileges?,"Service accounts with high privileges must be managed and controlled. Service accounts are used by applications or services to interact with the operating system or other services. Due to their elevated permissions, strict management and control are essential to prevent their misuse if compromised."
What is the main objective of Recommendation #6?,"The main objective of Recommendation #6 is to improve incident response processes for a more effective response to cyber attacks. This involves enhancing an organization's ability to detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, recover from, and learn from security incidents."
How can the effectiveness of response plans be ensured?,"To ensure that response plans are effective, they must be tested with regular frequency. Regular testing helps identify weaknesses, refine procedures, and ensure that personnel are familiar with their roles and responsibilities during an actual cyber incident."
What type of communication modes must be used during incident response?,"Pre-defined modes of communication must be used during incident response. These established communication channels and protocols ensure clear, consistent, and timely information exchange among incident response teams, stakeholders, and potentially external parties, which is crucial during a crisis."
"What balance must be struck during incident response regarding containment, remediation, and eradication?","During incident response, the correct balance must be struck between containment, remediation, and eradication, and the need to monitor an attacker and preserve critical evidence. Containment aims to stop the spread of an attack, remediation fixes the vulnerabilities, and eradication removes the attacker's presence. Balancing these with monitoring and evidence preservation is vital for both immediate recovery and future forensic analysis."
What is necessary for investigating an incident effectively?,"Information and data necessary to investigate an incident must be readily available. This includes logs, network traffic data, system configurations, and other relevant forensic artifacts, which are crucial for understanding the scope, impact, and root cause of a cyber attack."
What organizational entity should be established to improve detection and response capabilities?,"An Advanced Security Operation Centre (ASOC) or Cyber Defence Centre (CDC) should be established to improve the ability to detect and respond to intrusions. These centers serve as centralized units responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security incidents, leveraging specialized tools and expertise."
What is Recommendation #7 focused on achieving?,Recommendation #7 is focused on strengthening partnerships between industry and government to achieve a higher level of collective security. This collaborative approach recognizes that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility that extends beyond individual organizations.
What specific action is recommended regarding threat intelligence?,"Threat intelligence sharing should be enhanced. Threat intelligence involves information about existing or emerging threats and vulnerabilities, including indicators of compromise (IOCs), attack methodologies, and threat actor profiles. Enhanced sharing allows organizations and government agencies to proactively defend against known threats."
With whom should partnerships be strengthened to enhance collective security?,"Partnerships with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be strengthened. ISPs play a crucial role in the internet infrastructure, and collaboration with them can facilitate better threat detection, incident response, and overall network security across the digital ecosystem."
How should defence beyond borders be approached?,"Defence beyond borders should be approached through strengthening cross-border and cross-sector partnerships. Cyber threats often originate from outside national boundaries and target multiple sectors, necessitating international and inter-sectoral collaboration for effective collective defence."
What analytical approach is recommended for collective defence using a network?,"Applying behavioural analytics for collective defence is recommended when using a network to defend a network. Behavioural analytics involves monitoring and analyzing user and system behavior to detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activity, contributing to a more proactive and intelligent defence strategy."
What is the importance of IT security risk assessments and audits?,"IT security risk assessments and audits are important for ascertaining gaps in an organisation's policies, processes, and procedures. They help identify vulnerabilities, evaluate the effectiveness of existing controls, and ensure compliance with security standards and regulations."
How often should IT security risk assessments be conducted on CII and mission-critical systems?,"IT security risk assessments must be conducted on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and mission-critical systems annually and upon specified events. CII systems are essential assets whose disruption could have a debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health, or safety, while mission-critical systems are vital for an organization's operations. Regular and event-driven assessments ensure ongoing security posture."
What action is required for audit action items?,"Audit action items must be remediated. Remediation involves addressing and correcting the deficiencies or non-compliance issues identified during an audit, ensuring that security controls are improved and risks are mitigated."

By identifying these gaps, organizations can implement appropriate controls and improvements to enhance their overall security posture."
What is the purpose of Recommendation #9?,"The purpose of Recommendation #9 is to put enhanced safeguards in place to protect electronic medical records. This is critical due to the sensitive nature of patient data, which requires robust measures to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
What type of policy must be formulated for electronic medical records?,"A clear policy on measures to secure the confidentiality, integrity, and accountability of electronic medical records must be formulated. This policy provides the framework for how patient data is handled, protected, and managed throughout its lifecycle."
How should databases containing patient data be monitored?,"Databases containing patient data must be monitored in real-time for suspicious activity. Real-time monitoring allows for immediate detection of unauthorized access attempts, unusual data queries, or other indicators of compromise, enabling prompt response."
How should end-user access to electronic health records be handled?,"End-user access to the electronic health records should be made more secure. This involves implementing strong authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls, and regular reviews of access privileges to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify patient data."
What measures should be considered for data-at-rest?,"Measures should be considered to secure data-at-rest. Data-at-rest refers to data that is stored on physical media, such as hard drives, databases, or backup tapes. Securing it typically involves encryption to protect it from unauthorized access even if the storage medium is compromised."
What controls are necessary to protect against data exfiltration?,"Controls must be put in place to better protect against the risk of data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. Controls can include data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, network segmentation, and monitoring outbound traffic for suspicious patterns."
At what levels must access to sensitive data be restricted?,"Access to sensitive data must be restricted at both the front-end and at the database-level. Front-end restrictions control what users can see and do through applications, while database-level restrictions enforce access policies directly on the data storage, providing a layered defense."
"Define ""data-at-rest"" in the context of electronic medical records.","In the context of electronic medical records, ""data-at-rest"" refers to patient data that is stored on physical media, such as hard drives, databases, or backup tapes, and is not actively moving across a network. Securing data-at-rest typically involves encryption to protect it from unauthorized access."
"What is ""data exfiltration"" and how can it be protected against?","Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. To protect against this risk, controls must be put in place, which can include data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, network segmentation, and monitoring outbound traffic for suspicious patterns to prevent sensitive information from leaving the controlled environment."
What is Recommendation #10 about?,"Recommendation #10 states that domain controllers must be better secured against attack. Domain controllers are servers that respond to security authentication requests within a computer network domain, and their compromise can lead to full control over the network."
How should the operating system for domain controllers be managed to enhance security?,"The operating system for domain controllers must be more regularly updated to harden these servers against the risk of cyber attack. Regular updates and patching address known vulnerabilities, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit weaknesses in the operating system."
How can the attack surface for domain controllers be reduced?,"The attack surface for domain controllers should be reduced by limiting login access. Limiting login access means restricting who can log into these critical servers and from where, thereby reducing the number of potential entry points for attackers."
What authentication method is required for administrative access to domain controllers?,"Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication (2FA). Two-factor authentication is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity, typically something they know (like a password) and something they have (like a token or smartphone). This adds a crucial layer of security to prevent unauthorized administrative control."
What is the primary goal of Recommendation #11?,"The primary goal of Recommendation #11 is to implement a robust patch management process to address security vulnerabilities. Patch management is the process of distributing and applying updates to software and systems to fix bugs, improve performance, and, most importantly, resolve security vulnerabilities."
What is the first step in implementing a robust patch management process?,"The first step in implementing a robust patch management process is that a clear policy on patch management must be formulated and implemented. This policy should outline procedures, responsibilities, timelines, and testing requirements for applying patches."
What must the patch management process provide for in terms of oversight?,"The patch management process must provide for oversight with the reporting of appropriate metrics. This means that there should be mechanisms to track the status of patching, identify unpatched systems, measure compliance, and report on the overall effectiveness of the patch management program."
"Define ""patch management process"" in the context of addressing security vulnerabilities.","A ""patch management process"" in the context of addressing security vulnerabilities refers to the systematic approach of identifying, acquiring, testing, and applying software updates (patches) to computer systems and applications. Its purpose is to fix bugs, improve functionality, and, critically, to remediate security flaws that could be exploited by attackers."
Why is a robust patch management process essential for security?,"A robust patch management process is essential for security because it directly addresses security vulnerabilities. Software and systems often contain flaws that attackers can exploit. By regularly applying patches, organizations can close these security gaps, reduce their attack surface, and protect against known exploits, thereby preventing potential breaches."
What are the two key components required for a robust patch management process?,"The two key components required for a robust patch management process are: first, a clear policy on patch management must be formulated and implemented; and second, the patch management process must provide for oversight with the reporting of appropriate metrics. These ensure structured execution and accountability."
