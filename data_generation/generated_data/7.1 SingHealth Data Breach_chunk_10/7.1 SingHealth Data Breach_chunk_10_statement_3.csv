Explain the fourth recommendation regarding enhanced security checks.,"The fourth recommendation emphasizes that enhanced security checks must be performed, particularly on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems. **Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems** are those whose disruption or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters. This recommendation involves a series of proactive measures to identify and mitigate security weaknesses and threats within these vital systems."
What is the importance of vulnerability assessments in enhancing security checks?,"Vulnerability assessments are crucial for enhancing security checks as they must be conducted regularly. A **vulnerability assessment** is a systematic process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities (weaknesses) in a system, network, or application. Regular assessments help an organization understand its security posture and address weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors."
"Describe the role of safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products in security.","Safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products must be carried out where feasible to enhance security. This process ensures that third-party products integrated into an organization's systems meet specified security standards and do not introduce new vulnerabilities, thereby reducing supply chain risks and ensuring the overall integrity of the IT environment."
Why is penetration testing recommended for enhanced security checks?,"Penetration testing is recommended because it must be conducted regularly as part of enhanced security checks. **Penetration testing**, often called pen testing, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, network, or web application to evaluate the security of the system. It helps identify exploitable vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms from an attacker's perspective."
What is red teaming and why should it be carried out periodically?,"Red teaming should be carried out periodically as a component of enhanced security checks. **Red teaming** involves simulating a real-world adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to test an organization's security posture, detection capabilities, and incident response effectiveness. Performing it periodically helps organizations continuously improve their defenses against sophisticated and evolving threats."
What is threat hunting and why must it be considered for enhanced security?,Threat hunting must be considered as a proactive measure for enhanced security. **Threat hunting** is a proactive cybersecurity activity where security analysts actively search for threats that are undetected by automated security tools. It involves looking for suspicious activities or indicators of compromise (IOCs) that might signify an ongoing attack or a breach that has not yet been discovered.
List the specific enhanced security checks recommended for Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems.,"For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, the recommended enhanced security checks include:\n1. Regular vulnerability assessments.\n2. Carrying out safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products where feasible.\n3. Regular penetration testing.\n4.

Summarize Recommendation #5 regarding privileged administrator accounts.,"Recommendation #5 states that privileged administrator accounts must be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring. This is essential because these accounts, due to their elevated permissions and access rights, pose a significant risk if compromised. Therefore, stringent management, robust authentication, and continuous oversight are required to prevent unauthorized access and misuse."
What is the purpose of creating an inventory of administrative accounts?,"An inventory of administrative accounts should be created to facilitate the rationalisation of such accounts. This means having a clear, up-to-date record of all administrative accounts helps in managing them effectively, identifying dormant or unnecessary accounts, and ensuring that privileges are granted appropriately and reviewed regularly to minimize the attack surface."
Why is two-factor authentication mandatory for administrators?,"All administrators must use two-factor authentication when performing administrative tasks. **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** is a security process that requires two different methods of verification to prove a user's identity, typically something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a token or mobile device). This significantly reduces the risk of account compromise even if one factor is stolen, as an attacker would also need the second factor to gain access."
Explain the recommendation regarding the use of passphrases.,"The use of passphrases instead of passwords should be considered to reduce the risk of accounts being compromised. A **passphrase** is a sequence of words or a sentence used for authentication, typically longer and more complex than a traditional password, making it harder to guess or crack through brute-force attacks while potentially being easier for a user to remember."
What is the importance of password policies for both domain and local accounts?,"Password policies must be implemented and enforced across both domain and local accounts. **Password policies** are a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly. Enforcing these policies consistently across all account types, including **domain accounts** (managed by a central directory service) and **local accounts** (managed on individual machines), ensures a uniform level of security and reduces the risk of weak credentials being exploited."
How should server local administrator accounts be managed?,"Server local administrator accounts must be centrally managed across the IT network. Centralized management ensures consistent application of security policies, easier auditing, and better control over these highly privileged accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse on individual servers and improving overall security posture."
What measures are required for service accounts with high privileges?,"Service accounts with high privileges must be managed and controlled. **Service accounts** are user accounts used by applications or services to interact with the operating system or other services. Due to their high privileges, they require strict management, including regular reviews, adherence to the principle of least privilege, and strong authentication, to prevent them from becoming an attack vector if compromised."
