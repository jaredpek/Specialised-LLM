What type of center should be established to improve detection and response capabilities?,An Advanced Security Operation Centre (SOC) or Cyber Defence Centre should be established to improve the ability to detect and respond to intrusions. A Security Operation Centre (SOC) is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level.
What are the key components of an effective incident response process?,"Key components of an effective incident response process include regularly testing response plans, using pre-defined modes of communication, balancing containment, remediation, and eradication with attacker monitoring and evidence preservation, ensuring readily available investigation data, and potentially establishing an Advanced Security Operation Centre or Cyber Defence Centre."
What is the purpose of Recommendation #7?,Recommendation #7 focuses on establishing partnerships between industry and government to achieve a higher level of collective security.
What aspect of threat information should be improved?,Threat intelligence sharing should be enhanced to improve collective security.
What specific partnerships should be strengthened?,"Partnerships with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be strengthened. Additionally, cross-border and cross-sector partnerships are crucial for defence beyond borders."
How can a network be defended for collective security?,A network can be defended for collective security by applying behavioural analytics.
What are the key strategies for achieving collective security through partnerships?,"Key strategies for achieving collective security through partnerships include enhancing threat intelligence sharing, strengthening partnerships with Internet Service Providers, reinforcing cross-border and cross-sector partnerships for defence beyond borders, and applying behavioural analytics for collective defence."
What is the core message of Recommendation #8?,Recommendation #8 emphasizes that IT security risk assessments and audit processes must be treated seriously and carried out regularly.
Why are IT security risk assessments and audits important?,"IT security risk assessments and audits are important for ascertaining gaps in an organisation's policies, processes, and procedures."
How often should IT security risk assessments be conducted on critical systems?,IT security risk assessments must be conducted on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and mission-critical systems annually and upon specified events.
What must be done with audit action items?,"Audit action items must be remediated, meaning that identified issues and deficiencies from audits must be corrected."
What is the scope and frequency for conducting IT security risk assessments?,"IT security risk assessments should be conducted on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and mission-critical systems annually and upon specified events. These assessments are crucial for identifying gaps in an organization's policies, processes, and procedures."
What is the primary goal of Recommendation #9?,Recommendation #9 focuses on implementing enhanced safeguards to protect electronic medical records.
What policy is required for electronic medical records?,"A clear policy on measures to secure the confidentiality, integrity, and accountability of electronic medical records must be formulated."
How should databases containing patient data be monitored?,Databases containing patient data must be monitored in real-time for suspicious activity.
What is recommended for end-user access to electronic health records?,End-user access to the electronic health records should be made more secure.
What measures should be considered for data security?,"Measures should be considered to secure data-at-rest. Data-at-rest refers to data that is stored on a physical medium, such as a hard drive, database, or backup tape, when it is not actively being transmitted or processed."
What controls are necessary to protect against data exfiltration?,Controls must be put in place to better protect against the risk of data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network.
