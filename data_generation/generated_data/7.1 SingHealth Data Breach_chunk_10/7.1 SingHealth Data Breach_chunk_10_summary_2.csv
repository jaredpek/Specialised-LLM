Summarize the recommendations for tighter control and greater monitoring of privileged administrator accounts.,"To achieve tighter control and greater monitoring of privileged administrator accounts, several measures are recommended. An inventory of administrative accounts should be created for rationalisation. All administrators must use two-factor authentication for administrative tasks. The use of passphrases instead of passwords should be considered to reduce compromise risk. Password policies must be implemented and enforced across both domain and local accounts. Server local administrator accounts must be centrally managed across the IT network, and service accounts with high privileges must be managed and controlled. \n\n*   **Privileged administrator accounts:** User accounts with elevated permissions that can make significant changes to systems, configurations, and data. \n*   **Two-factor authentication (2FA):** A security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. \n*   **Passphrases:** A sequence of words or other text used to gain access to a computer system or data, typically longer and more memorable than traditional passwords. \n*   **Password policies:** A set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly. \n*   **Domain accounts:** User accounts managed by a central directory service (like Active Directory) within a network domain. \n*   **Local accounts:** User accounts stored directly on a specific computer, not managed by a central directory. \n*   **Service accounts:** Accounts used by applications or services to interact with the operating system or other services, often requiring elevated privileges."
What is the purpose of creating an inventory of administrative accounts?,"An inventory of administrative accounts should be created to facilitate the rationalisation of such accounts. This helps in understanding the scope of privileged access, identifying dormant or unnecessary accounts, and ensuring that access is granted only when essential. \n\n*   **Administrative accounts:** User accounts with elevated permissions that allow them to manage system settings, install software, and access sensitive data."
Why is two-factor authentication mandatory for administrators?,"All administrators must use two-factor authentication (2FA) when performing administrative tasks to enhance security.

These measures collectively aim to fortify these critical network components. \n\n*   **Domain controllers:** Servers that respond to security authentication requests within a computer network domain, centralizing user and computer account management. \n*   **Attack surface:** The sum of the different points where an unauthorized user can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment. \n*   **Two-factor authentication (2FA):** A security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity."
Can you summarise the key requirements for implementing a robust patch management process?,"Implementing a robust patch management process to address security vulnerabilities requires two key elements: first, the formulation and implementation of a clear policy on patch management, which outlines procedures and responsibilities. Second, the process must include provisions for oversight, supported by the reporting of appropriate metrics to ensure effectiveness and compliance. \n\n*   **Patch management:** The process of acquiring, testing, and installing code changes (patches) to software and systems to fix bugs, improve performance, or address security vulnerabilities. \n*   **Security vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in a system or software that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause harm."
What are the specific types of security checks recommended for CII systems?,"For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, the specific types of security checks recommended include vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products, red teaming, and threat hunting. \n\n*   **CII systems (Critical Information Infrastructure):** These are systems whose disruption or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters. \n*   **Vulnerability assessments:** Systematic reviews of security weaknesses in an information system or network. \n*   **Penetration testing:** An authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, network, or web application to evaluate the security of the system. \n*   **Red teaming:** A full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation designed to test an organization's security posture and incident response capabilities. \n*   **Threat hunting:** A proactive cyber defense activity that involves searching for threats that are not detected by automated security tools."
