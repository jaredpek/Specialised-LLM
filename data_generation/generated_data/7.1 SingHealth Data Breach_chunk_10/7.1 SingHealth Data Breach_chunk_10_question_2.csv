What is Recommendation #4 regarding enhanced security checks?,"Recommendation #4 states that enhanced security checks must be performed, particularly on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems. CII systems are assets, physical or virtual, that are essential to the maintenance of vital societal functions, health, safety, security, economic well-being of citizens, or the effective functioning of government."
What types of enhanced security checks are recommended for CII systems?,"For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, enhanced security checks include conducting vulnerability assessments regularly, carrying out safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products where feasible, conducting penetration testing regularly, periodically carrying out red teaming, and considering threat hunting."
Why are vulnerability assessments important for enhanced security checks?,"Vulnerability assessments are important for enhanced security checks because they must be conducted regularly to identify and quantify security weaknesses in a system. A vulnerability assessment is a process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system."
What is the role of penetration testing in enhancing security?,"Penetration testing plays a crucial role in enhancing security by simulating real-world cyberattacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. It must be conducted regularly to ensure the ongoing security posture of systems. Penetration testing, often called pen testing, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system."
What is red teaming and why should it be carried out periodically?,"Red teaming is a simulated attack exercise where a dedicated team, known as the ""red team,"" acts as an adversary to test an organization's security defenses and incident response capabilities. It should be carried out periodically to provide an objective assessment of the organization's security posture from an attacker's perspective, uncovering weaknesses that other security checks might miss."
What is threat hunting and why must it be considered?,"Threat hunting is a proactive cybersecurity activity where security analysts actively search for threats within a network that have evaded existing security solutions. It must be considered because it helps to detect and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other sophisticated attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed, thereby strengthening an organization's overall security posture."
What measures should be taken regarding vendor products for enhanced security?,"For enhanced security, especially on Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products must be carried out where feasible. This ensures that third-party components do not introduce new vulnerabilities into the system."
What is Recommendation #5 concerning privileged administrator accounts?,"Recommendation #5 states that privileged administrator accounts must be subject to tighter control and greater monitoring. Privileged administrator accounts are user accounts that have elevated permissions and access rights to critical systems and data, making them prime targets for attackers."
How can the rationalisation of administrative accounts be facilitated?,"The rationalisation of administrative accounts can be facilitated by creating an inventory of all such accounts. An inventory provides a comprehensive list, enabling better management, tracking, and consolidation or removal of unnecessary accounts."
What authentication method is required for administrators performing administrative tasks?,"All administrators must use two-factor authentication (2FA) when performing administrative tasks. Two-factor authentication is a security process in which a user provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves, typically something they know (like a password) and something they have (like a phone or token)."
What alternative to passwords should be considered to reduce account compromise risk?,"The use of passphrases instead of passwords should be considered to reduce the risk of accounts being compromised. A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to gain access to a computer system or data, generally longer and more complex than a traditional password, making it harder to guess or crack."
What is required regarding password policies for accounts?,"Password policies must be implemented and enforced across both domain and local accounts. A password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly. Domain accounts are user accounts managed by a central directory service (like Active Directory), while local accounts are specific to a single computer."
How should server local administrator accounts be managed?,"Server local administrator accounts must be centrally managed across the IT network. Centralized management ensures consistent application of security policies, easier monitoring, and better control over these highly privileged accounts."
What is the requirement for service accounts with high privileges?,"Service accounts with high privileges must be managed and controlled. Service accounts are user accounts used by applications or services to interact with the operating system or other services, and due to their elevated permissions, they require strict management to prevent misuse."
What is the primary objective of tighter control and greater monitoring for privileged administrator accounts?,"The primary objective of tighter control and greater monitoring for privileged administrator accounts is to enhance security and reduce the risk of these critical accounts being compromised. Privileged administrator accounts have elevated access rights, making them high-value targets for cyber attackers."
What is the purpose of creating an inventory of administrative accounts?,"The purpose of creating an inventory of administrative accounts is to facilitate the rationalisation of such accounts. Rationalisation involves reviewing, consolidating, and optimizing the number and usage of administrative accounts to improve security and management efficiency."
What is Recommendation #6 regarding incident response processes?,"Recommendation #6 states that incident response processes must be improved for a more effective response to cyber attacks. Incident response processes are a structured approach to managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack, aiming to minimize damage and recovery time."
How can the effectiveness of response plans be ensured?,"To ensure that response plans are effective, they must be tested with regular frequency. Regular testing helps identify gaps, refine procedures, and ensure that personnel are familiar with their roles during an actual incident."
What type of communication modes must be used during incident response?,"Pre-defined modes of communication must be used during incident response. Pre-defined modes of communication establish clear channels and protocols for information exchange during a cyber incident, ensuring efficient and coordinated efforts among response teams and stakeholders."
What balance must be struck during incident response?,"During incident response, the correct balance must be struck between containment, remediation, and eradication, and the need to monitor an attacker and preserve critical evidence. Containment aims to stop the spread of an attack, remediation fixes the vulnerabilities, and eradication removes the threat, all while carefully managing evidence for forensic analysis."
What information is necessary for investigating an incident?,"Information and data necessary to investigate an incident must be readily available. This includes logs, system configurations, network traffic data, and other relevant forensic artifacts that help understand the scope and nature of the attack."
What type of center should be established to improve detection and response to intrusions?,"An Advanced Security Operation Centre (SOC) or Cyber Defence Centre should be established to improve the ability to detect and respond to intrusions. An SOC is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level, responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents."
Why is regular testing of response plans crucial?,"Regular testing of response plans is crucial to ensure their effectiveness. This practice helps identify weaknesses, validate procedures, and train personnel, ultimately leading to a more efficient and coordinated response during an actual cyber attack."
What is Recommendation #7 about achieving a higher level of collective security?,"Recommendation #7 focuses on strengthening partnerships between industry and government to achieve a higher level of collective security. Collective security refers to a system where multiple entities collaborate to maintain security, recognizing that a threat to one is a threat to all."
What should be enhanced regarding threat information?,"Threat intelligence sharing should be enhanced. Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, and actionable advice about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets, which can be used to inform decisions regarding the subject's response to that menace or hazard."
With whom should partnerships be strengthened for collective security?,"Partnerships with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be strengthened. ISPs are organizations that provide services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet, and their collaboration is vital for broader network defense and threat mitigation."
What kind of partnerships should be strengthened for defence beyond borders?,"Cross-border and cross-sector partnerships should be strengthened for defence beyond borders. Cross-border partnerships involve collaboration between entities in different countries, while cross-sector partnerships involve collaboration between different industries or government sectors, both crucial for addressing global and diverse cyber threats."
How can a network be defended using behavioural analytics?,"A network can be defended by applying behavioural analytics for collective defence. Behavioural analytics involves using data analysis to understand and predict user and system behavior, identifying anomalies that may indicate a cyber threat.

How should end-user access to electronic health records be handled?,"End-user access to the electronic health records should be made more secure. This involves implementing robust authentication mechanisms, access controls, and regular reviews of user permissions to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient information."
What measures should be considered for securing data-at-rest?,"Measures should be considered to secure data-at-rest. Data-at-rest refers to data that is stored on physical media, such as hard drives, databases, or backup tapes, and securing it typically involves encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized access."
What controls must be put in place to protect against data exfiltration?,"Controls must be put in place to better protect against the risk of data exfiltration. Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network, and controls can include data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, network monitoring, and strict access policies."
How must access to sensitive data be restricted?,"Access to sensitive data must be restricted at both the front-end and at the database-level. Front-end restrictions control what users can see and interact with through applications, while database-level restrictions enforce access rules directly on the stored data, providing a layered defense."
What are the three key security principles that a policy for electronic medical records should secure?,"A clear policy for electronic medical records must secure confidentiality, integrity, and accountability. Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals can access the data. Integrity ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and has not been tampered with. Accountability ensures that actions performed on the data can be attributed to specific individuals, providing an audit trail."
What is Recommendation #10 regarding securing domain controllers?,"Recommendation #10 states that domain controllers must be better secured against attack. A domain controller is a server that responds to security authentication requests (logging in, checking permissions, etc.) within a computer network domain, making it a critical component for network security."
How should the operating system for domain controllers be managed to harden them against cyber attacks?,"The operating system for domain controllers must be more regularly updated to harden these servers against the risk of cyber attack. Regular updates and patching address known vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface available to malicious actors."
How can the attack surface for domain controllers be reduced?,"The attack surface for domain controllers should be reduced by limiting login access. Limiting login access minimizes the number of potential entry points for attackers, thereby reducing the opportunities for unauthorized access or exploitation."
What authentication method is required for administrative access to domain controllers?,"Administrative access to domain controllers must require two-factor authentication (2FA). Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two different authentication factors, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if they compromise a password."
What is Recommendation #11 concerning a robust patch management process?,"Recommendation #11 states that a robust patch management process must be implemented to address security vulnerabilities. A patch management process is a systematic approach to identifying, acquiring, testing, and applying software updates (patches) to systems and applications to fix bugs, improve performance, and, critically, resolve security vulnerabilities."
What policy must be formulated and implemented for patch management?,"A clear policy on patch management must be formulated and implemented. This policy outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and timelines for applying patches, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to vulnerability management."
What must the patch management process provide for oversight?,"The patch management process must provide for oversight with the reporting of appropriate metrics. Oversight ensures that the process is being followed effectively, and metrics provide measurable data on patch compliance, vulnerability remediation rates, and overall security posture improvements."
Why is a robust patch management process essential for addressing security vulnerabilities?,A robust patch management process is essential for addressing security vulnerabilities because it systematically ensures that software and systems are kept up-to-date with the latest security fixes. This proactive approach significantly reduces the attack surface by closing known security gaps that attackers could exploit.
