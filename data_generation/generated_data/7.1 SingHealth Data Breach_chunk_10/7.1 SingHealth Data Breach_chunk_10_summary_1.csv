Summarise the key enhanced security checks recommended for CII systems.,"Enhanced security checks, particularly for Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, which are systems whose disruption or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof, involve several measures. These include regularly conducting vulnerability assessments, which is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system, and penetration testing, an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, network, or web application to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. Additionally, safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products must be carried out where feasible. Periodic red teaming exercises, a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation designed to test an organization's security posture and incident response capabilities, should be performed, and threat hunting, a proactive cyber defense activity that involves searching for threats that are not detected by automated security tools, must be considered."
What are the recommended practices for assessing system vulnerabilities and security posture?,"To assess system vulnerabilities and security posture, it is recommended that vulnerability assessments, the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system, be conducted regularly. Furthermore, penetration testing, an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, network, or web application to check for exploitable vulnerabilities, must also be conducted regularly. Red teaming exercises, a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation, should be carried out periodically, and threat hunting, a proactive cyber defense activity, must be considered."
Can you summarise the key considerations for vendor product security?,"For vendor product security, it is recommended that safety reviews, evaluation, and certification of vendor products be carried out where feasible to ensure their security and reliability."
Explain the importance of regular security testing activities.,"Regular security testing activities are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. Specifically, vulnerability assessments, the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system, must be conducted regularly to identify weaknesses, and penetration testing, an authorized simulated cyberattack, must also be conducted regularly to simulate real-world attacks. Periodically, red teaming exercises, a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation, should be carried out to test defenses comprehensively, and threat hunting, a proactive cyber defense activity, must be considered to proactively search for undetected threats."
What is threat hunting and why is it recommended?,"Threat hunting is a proactive cyber defense activity that involves searching for threats that are not detected by automated security tools. It is recommended as part of enhanced security checks to identify and mitigate advanced persistent threats or novel attack techniques that might otherwise go unnoticed, thereby strengthening an organization's overall security posture."
Differentiate between vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.,"Vulnerability assessments involve identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system, typically through automated scanning and analysis. Penetration testing, on the other hand, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, network, or web application to check for exploitable vulnerabilities, often involving manual techniques to exploit identified weaknesses. Both must be conducted regularly as part of enhanced security checks."
Summarise the recommendations for tighter control and greater monitoring of privileged administrator accounts.,"To achieve tighter control and greater monitoring of privileged administrator accounts, which are user accounts with elevated permissions, several measures are recommended. An inventory of administrative accounts should be created to facilitate their rationalisation. All administrators must use two-factor authentication (2FA), a security process requiring two different authentication factors, when performing administrative tasks. The use of passphrases, sequences of words or text generally more secure than traditional passwords, instead of passwords should be considered to reduce the risk of account compromise. Password policies must be implemented and enforced across both domain accounts (managed by a central directory service) and local accounts (stored directly on a specific computer). Server local administrator accounts must be centrally managed across the IT network, and service accounts, used by applications or services, with high privileges must be managed and controlled."
