Analyse the design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) with respect to its core security objectives.,"The design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are centered around ensuring its reliability and security. These principles include:

1.  **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible method to breach system security by circumventing the TCB. The TCB, in this context, refers to the minimal set of hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical for enforcing the security policy of a system. If the TCB can be bypassed, its security guarantees are nullified.
2.  **Tamper-resistant (security):** The TCB must be protected against unauthorized interference from other parts of the system that lie outside its boundary. This means that external components cannot modify the TCB's code or its operational state. Tamper-resistance is crucial to maintain the integrity of the TCB itself.
3.  **Verifiable (or correctness):** It should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation can be rigorously checked to ensure it behaves as expected and correctly enforces the system's security policies. Verifiability contributes to the trustworthiness of the TCB."
What insights can be derived from the analysis of the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"Analyzing the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) provides several key insights into system security and design:

1.  **Trustworthiness and Verifiability:** A system with a smaller TCB is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which advocates for simplicity in design to enhance reliability and maintainability.
2.  **Design Challenge:** Despite the benefits of a smaller TCB, designing a secure system with one is often more challenging. The reduction in TCB size means that the system needs to account for a greater number of potential malicious entities or attack vectors outside the TCB, which might otherwise have been implicitly trusted within a larger TCB. This requires a more meticulous and robust security architecture for the non-TCB components."
Describe the different types of attackers based on their operational methods.,"Attackers can be categorized based on their operational methods into two primary types:

1.  **Active Attacker:** An active attacker is one who manipulates or disrupts the target systems. Their actions involve direct interference, such as modifying data, injecting malicious code, or altering system behavior. The goal of an active attacker is to cause damage, gain unauthorized control, or change the state of the system.
2.  **Passive Attacker:** A passive attacker, in contrast, focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation. Their activities include eavesdropping, monitoring network traffic, or collecting data without making any changes to the system's code, state, or data. The primary objective of a passive attacker is typically information acquisition, such as stealing sensitive data or understanding system vulnerabilities, without being detected."
Explain the various levels of knowledge an attacker might possess regarding a target system.,"An attacker's knowledge about a target system can vary significantly, influencing their attack strategies and potential success. The levels of knowledge include:

1.  **Detailed Knowledge:** An attacker may possess comprehensive knowledge of the system's design, architecture, source code, and other internal specifics. This level of insight allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks, as the attacker can exploit known vulnerabilities or design flaws with precision.
2.  **Lack of Detailed Knowledge:** Conversely, an attacker might lack detailed knowledge of the system. In such cases, they must rely on less precise methods to understand and exploit the system. This often involves probing, which is systematically testing the system's responses to various inputs, or trial and error, where different attack techniques are attempted until one succeeds. This approach is typically less efficient but can still be effective if the system has easily discoverable vulnerabilities."
"What factors define an attacker's capability, and how do these influence their potential impact?","An attacker's capability is defined by several factors that significantly influence their potential impact on a system:

1.  **Computing Resources:** This refers to the amount of computational power, storage, and network bandwidth an attacker can leverage. Greater computing resources enable more complex attacks, such as brute-force password cracking, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or sophisticated cryptanalysis.
2.  **System Interaction:** This factor determines what parts of the system the attacker can interact with. An attacker with access to critical system interfaces or internal components can potentially cause more damage or extract more sensitive information than one limited to external, user-facing interfaces.
3.  **Time Constraints:** This considers whether the attacker has unlimited time to execute an attack or needs to act quickly. Attackers with ample time can conduct prolonged reconnaissance, develop custom exploits, and patiently probe for vulnerabilities. Those under time pressure might resort to simpler, faster, but potentially less stealthy methods."
Analyse the common security properties outlined by the CIA model.,"The Common Security Properties, often referred to as the CIA model, are fundamental goals for securing a system. These properties are:

1.  **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. It ensures that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. For example, eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying are all threats to confidentiality, as they involve unauthorized access to or acquisition of data.
2.  **Integrity (I):** Integrity focuses on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system states and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. Threats to integrity include intercepting packets, modifying them, and then releasing them, which can lead to corrupted data or altered system behavior.
3.  **Availability (A):** Availability ensures that information and resources are not withheld from authorized users without authorization. The resources should always be accessible and usable by those who are permitted to use them. Disrupting services, for instance, is a direct attack on availability, making resources inaccessible to legitimate users."
"What are the 'other properties' of security beyond the CIA model, and how do they contribute to a robust security posture?","Beyond the foundational CIA model (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), several other security properties contribute to a robust security posture:

1.  **Accountability:** This property ensures that the actions of an entity within a system can be traced and identified. It is crucial for auditing, forensic analysis, and deterring malicious behavior, as individuals know their actions can be attributed to them.
2.  **Non-repudiation:** Non-repudiation provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. It prevents an entity from falsely denying that they performed a particular action, such as sending a message or approving a transaction. This is vital in legal and contractual contexts.
3.  **Authenticity:** Authenticity ensures that the communicated entity is indeed the correct and claimed entity. It verifies the identity of users, systems, or data sources, preventing impersonation and ensuring trust in interactions.
4.  **Anonymity or privacy:** This property aims to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. It protects individuals' sensitive data and ensures their activities cannot be linked back to them, supporting privacy regulations and user trust.
5.  **Verifiability:** Verifiability means that the system's operations can be independently verified. This allows for external auditing and assurance that the system is functioning correctly and securely, without relying solely on the system's internal claims.
6.  **Freshness:** Freshness ensures that data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. This prevents replay attacks, where old, legitimate messages are retransmitted to achieve an unauthorized effect.
7.  **Fault tolerance:** Fault tolerance allows the system to continue functioning correctly despite failures in some of its components. This property enhances availability and reliability, ensuring that localized issues do not lead to a complete system outage."
"Analyse the threat model for the Target attack case study, focusing on the Trusted Computing Base and adversarial capabilities.","The threat model for the Target attack case study reveals critical aspects of how the breach occurred, particularly concerning the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and adversarial capabilities:

1.  **Trusted Computing Base (TCB):** In this scenario, the Target computer system, including its operating system (OS) and hardware, was considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the ""Trojan.POSRAM"" malware, was explicitly *not* trusted. This malware was the component responsible for leaking data to the attacker. This highlights a critical vulnerability: even if the underlying hardware and OS are deemed secure, malicious applications running on them can compromise the system's security objectives.
2.  **Adversarial Capabilities and Knowledge:** The attacker demonstrated the capability to launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. This malware, identified as a RAM scraper, was designed to collect unencrypted payment card information directly from the POS terminal's memory just after it was swiped. The attacker's knowledge allowed them to exploit this specific vulnerability in the payment processing flow, enabling them to collect credit card data stored in the database and exfiltrate it. The malware also contained new attack methods to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers, indicating a sophisticated level of adversarial knowledge and capability."
"What security properties were primarily considered in the Target attack case study, and why?","In the Target attack case study, the primary security property considered was **Confidentiality**. This focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information.

**Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. In the context of the Target breach, the core issue was the unauthorized access and exfiltration of millions of customers' credit card data. The ""Trojan.POSRAM"" malware specifically targeted unencrypted payment card information, collecting it from POS terminals and sending it to a server in Russia. The entire incident revolved around the failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive customer financial data, leading to its disclosure to unauthorized parties. Therefore, protecting the system from leaking this sensitive information was the paramount security goal."
Describe the three main security strategies for system protection.,"The three main security strategies for system protection are Prevention, Detection, and Reaction:

1.  **Prevention:** This strategy involves implementing measures designed to stop a system from being damaged in the first place. Preventive measures aim to eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities and block potential attacks before they can succeed. Examples include firewalls, access controls, encryption, and secure coding practices.
2.  **Detection:** This strategy focuses on taking measures that allow for the identification of when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged. Detection mechanisms are put in place to alert administrators to ongoing or past security incidents. Examples include intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and regular security audits.
3.  **Reaction:** This strategy involves taking measures to recover a system from damage or to mitigate the impact of an attack. It also includes preparing for potential future incidents by assuming that security breaches will inevitably occur. Reaction strategies encompass incident response plans, data backup and recovery procedures, and disaster recovery planning. The principle here is to always assume that bad things will happen and to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome."
Explain the 'Least of Privilege' design principle and its importance in secure system design.,"The 'Least of Privilege' is a fundamental design principle in security that dictates how permissions should be assigned within a system. Its core tenets and importance are:

**Principle:**
1.  **Minimal Permissions:** Each entity (user, program, process) should be granted only the absolute minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task. No more, no less.
2.  **Just-in-Time Privilege:** Privileges should be granted only when they are explicitly needed for a task and should be revoked immediately after the task is completed.

**Importance:**
*   **Reduced Harm:** The less privilege a program or user has, the less harm it can inflict if it malfunctions, contains a bug, or becomes subverted by an attacker. This limits the scope of potential damage.
*   **Mitigation of Attacks:** Granting unnecessary permissions creates an attack surface. If a malicious entity gains control of a component with excessive privileges, it can abuse those permissions to perform unauthorized actions or escalate an attack. By adhering to the least of privilege, the potential impact of a successful compromise is significantly reduced.

**Examples:**
*   Never performing personal activities (like web browsing or email) using a root or administrator account in an operating system, as these accounts have extensive system-wide privileges.
*   A photo editing application on a smartphone being allowed access only to the gallery (to retrieve and save photos) but explicitly denied access to the microphone or location services, as these are not required for its core function."
"Analyse the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle, including its purpose and practical examples.","The 'Separation of Privilege' is a critical design principle aimed at enhancing security by distributing control and responsibility. Its purpose and practical applications are:

**Principle:**
1.  **Split Responsibility:** To perform a privileged action, it requires multiple distinct parties or entities to work together and collectively exercise that privilege. This means that no single point of control or decision exists for critical operations.
2.  **Risk Minimization:** The primary goal is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise. By requiring multiple independent approvals or actions, the principle ensures that no single entity has full, unchecked control over critical processes. This makes it harder for a single malicious actor, an accidental error, or a compromised account to cause significant damage.

**Examples:**
*   **Financial System:** In a financial system, transferring large sums of money typically requires a multi-step approval process. An employee (the 'initiator') might initiate the transfer, but it then requires additional approval from a manager (the 'reviewer') before it can be executed. This separates the privilege of initiating a transaction from the privilege of authorizing it.
*   **Software Development and Deployment:** A developer writes code, but they are typically not allowed to directly deploy that code to a production environment. Instead, deployment is handled by a separate operations team. This separation prevents a single developer from introducing malicious or buggy code directly into live systems without independent review and control, thereby separating the privilege of code creation from the privilege of code deployment."
What is the definition of 'Unbypassable' in the context of TCB design principles?,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design principles, 'Unbypassable' refers to the property of **completeness**. It means that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. The TCB is the core set of components responsible for enforcing security, and if an attacker can circumvent it, the security guarantees of the entire system are compromised. Therefore, an unbypassable TCB ensures that all security-critical operations and data flows are routed through and protected by the TCB."
Define 'Tamper-resistant' as a TCB design principle.,"As a TCB design principle, 'Tamper-resistant' refers to the property of **security**. It means that the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) should be protected against other parts of the system that are outside the TCB. Specifically, these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or its operational state. This principle is crucial to ensure that the TCB's integrity and correct functioning are preserved, preventing unauthorized alterations that could undermine its security enforcement capabilities."
Explain the 'Verifiable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Verifiable' principle in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design refers to the property of **correctness**. It states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design, implementation, and behavior can be rigorously examined and proven to meet its security specifications. Verifiability is essential for building trust in the TCB, as it allows for independent assurance that the TCB performs its security functions as intended without flaws or vulnerabilities."
How does the KISS principle relate to the size of a TCB?,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle directly relates to the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by advocating for simplicity to enhance security and trustworthiness. A system with a smaller TCB is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components. When a system is simpler, there are fewer potential points of failure or vulnerabilities, and it's easier to ensure that all components behave as expected. This reduction in complexity, in line with the KISS principle, makes the TCB more manageable to design, implement, and audit for correctness, thereby increasing its overall security and reliability."
What are the implications of designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) has significant implications. While a smaller TCB generally leads to a more trustworthy and easier-to-verify system (following the KISS principle), it also presents a greater challenge. The primary implication is that designers need to consider more malicious entities. This means that components outside the smaller TCB, which might have been implicitly trusted in a larger TCB, now need to be treated as potentially untrusted. This requires more robust security mechanisms and careful consideration of interactions between the TCB and the larger, less trusted parts of the system to maintain overall security."
Differentiate between an 'Active' and 'Passive' attacker.,"The distinction between an 'Active' and 'Passive' attacker lies in their interaction with the target system:

*   **Active Attacker:** An active attacker manipulates or disrupts the systems. Their actions involve direct interference, such as modifying data, injecting code, or altering system operations. The intent is to change the state of the system or its data.
*   **Passive Attacker:** A passive attacker focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. Their activities include monitoring communications or collecting data without making any changes to the system's code, state, or data. The intent is to acquire information without detection."
How does an attacker's knowledge influence their attack methodology?,"An attacker's knowledge significantly influences their attack methodology:

*   **Detailed Knowledge:** If an attacker knows the system's design, architecture, source code, etc., they can employ highly targeted and efficient attacks. This deep understanding allows them to identify specific vulnerabilities, craft precise exploits, and potentially bypass security measures with greater ease. They can leverage internal logic flaws or known weaknesses in the implementation.
*   **Lack of Detailed Knowledge:** When an attacker lacks detailed knowledge, they must resort to less precise and often more resource-intensive methods. This typically involves **probing**, which is systematically testing the system's responses to various inputs to infer its structure or vulnerabilities, or **trial and error**, where different attack techniques are attempted until one succeeds. These methods are generally slower and may be more detectable but can still be effective against systems with discoverable weaknesses."
What is 'Confidentiality' in the context of security properties?,"'Confidentiality' (C) is a core security property within the CIA model. Its objective is to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. This means ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. Examples of threats to confidentiality include eavesdropping, where communications are secretly listened to; packet sniffing, where data packets are intercepted and read; and illegal copying, where unauthorized duplicates of data are made. Maintaining confidentiality is crucial for protecting privacy and proprietary information."
Define 'Integrity' as a security property.,"'Integrity' (I) is a fundamental security property in the CIA model. Its purpose is to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. This ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. Threats to integrity involve actions like intercepting data packets, modifying their content, and then releasing them, which can lead to corrupted data, altered system behavior, or unauthorized changes to system configurations. Maintaining integrity is essential for the trustworthiness and reliability of data and systems."
Explain 'Availability' as a security property.,"'Availability' (A) is a key security property within the CIA model. It aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. The principle dictates that resources should always be available for authorized users when they need them. Threats to availability typically involve actions that disrupt services, making systems, data, or network resources inaccessible to legitimate users. Examples include denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which overwhelm a system with traffic, or ransomware, which encrypts data and makes it unavailable until a ransom is paid."
What is 'Accountability' in the realm of security properties?,"'Accountability' is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified within a system. This means that there is a record or mechanism to determine who performed what action, when, and where. Accountability is crucial for auditing, forensic investigations after a security incident, and for deterring malicious behavior, as individuals know their actions are not anonymous and can be attributed to them."
Define 'Non-repudiation' as a security property.,"'Non-repudiation' is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. It prevents an entity from successfully denying that they performed a particular action, such as sending a message, initiating a transaction, or creating a document. This property is vital in contexts where legal or contractual proof of action is required, ensuring that the origin or integrity of data cannot be legitimately disputed."
Explain the security property of 'Authenticity'.,"'Authenticity' is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity. This means verifying the identity of a user, a system, a process, or a piece of information. It confirms that something is genuine and has not been faked or impersonated. For example, when a user logs in, authenticity ensures that the user is indeed who they claim to be, preventing unauthorized access through identity spoofing."
What does 'Anonymity or privacy' entail as a security property?,"'Anonymity or privacy' as a security property entails the ability to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. Its goal is to protect an individual's sensitive data and ensure that their actions or presence cannot be linked back to their real-world identity without their consent. This property is crucial for protecting user privacy, complying with data protection regulations, and preventing surveillance or tracking."
Define 'Verifiability' in the context of security properties.,"'Verifiability' is a security property that states the system's operations can be independently verified. This means that external parties or auditing mechanisms can inspect and confirm that the system is functioning correctly and securely, adhering to its specified policies and behaviors. It provides an objective means to assess the trustworthiness and correctness of a system, rather than relying solely on its internal assertions."
Explain the security property of 'Freshness'.,"'Freshness' is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. This property is particularly important in preventing replay attacks, where an attacker captures a legitimate communication or data packet and retransmits it later to achieve an unauthorized effect. Freshness mechanisms, such as timestamps or nonces, ensure that each message or data exchange is unique and timely, preventing the successful re-use of old, valid information."
What is 'Fault tolerance' as a security property?,"'Fault tolerance' is a security property that enables a system to continue functioning correctly despite failures in some of its components. This property is crucial for maintaining system availability and reliability. Instead of crashing or becoming unavailable when a part fails, a fault-tolerant system is designed to detect the failure, isolate the faulty component, and continue its operations, often with degraded performance or by switching to redundant components. This ensures resilience against hardware malfunctions, software bugs, or even certain types of attacks."
Describe the role of malicious software in the Target attack threat model.,"In the Target attack threat model, malicious software played a central and critical role. The threat model explicitly states that while the Target computer system (including OS and hardware) was trusted, the malicious software was not. This software, identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM"" and similar to ""BlackPOS,"" was launched by the attacker on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. Its primary function was to act as a RAM scraper, collecting unencrypted payment card information directly from the POS terminal's memory immediately after it was swiped. This malware was the mechanism through which sensitive data was leaked to the attacker, highlighting that even with a trusted computing base, untrusted applications can compromise system security."
"How did the Target attackers manage to collect credit card data, according to the case study?","According to the Target attack case study, the attackers managed to collect credit card data by launching malicious software, specifically the ""Trojan.POSRAM"" malware, on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. This malware functioned as a RAM scraper, designed to collect unencrypted payment card information. The data was collected just after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory. After collection, the data was quietly moved around on Target's network, then transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server hijacked by the attackers, and finally sent to a server in Russia."
What was the primary security goal that failed during the Target data breach?,"The primary security goal that failed during the Target data breach was **Confidentiality**. The case study explicitly states that the security property considered was confidentiality, focusing on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information. The breach involved the unauthorized disclosure and exfiltration of millions of customers' credit card data, which is a direct violation of confidentiality. The malicious software collected and transmitted this sensitive information to unauthorized parties, demonstrating a failure to prevent its disclosure."
Explain the 'Prevention' security strategy with an example.,"The 'Prevention' security strategy involves taking measures that prevent a system from being damaged in the first place. The goal is to stop security incidents before they occur by eliminating vulnerabilities or blocking attack vectors. An example of a prevention strategy is implementing strong access controls, such as multi-factor authentication and role-based access, to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources. This prevents unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches or system compromise."
Describe the 'Detection' security strategy and its purpose.,"The 'Detection' security strategy involves taking measures so that one can detect when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged. The purpose of detection is to identify security incidents as they happen or shortly after, allowing for timely response and mitigation. This strategy does not prevent attacks but rather provides visibility into security events. Examples include intrusion detection systems (IDS) that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, or logging systems that record system events for later analysis to identify unauthorized actions."
"What is the 'Reaction' security strategy, and what is its underlying assumption?","The 'Reaction' security strategy involves taking measures to recover a system from damage or to recover from damage to a system. Its underlying assumption is that bad things will inevitably happen, and therefore, systems must be prepared for the worst-case outcome. This strategy focuses on incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity. Examples include having robust data backup and recovery plans, establishing incident response teams, and developing procedures to restore services after a cyberattack or system failure."
Provide an example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for a smartphone application.,"An example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for a smartphone application is a photo editing application. This application is only allowed access to the gallery, which is necessary for it to retrieve photos for editing and save the edited versions. Crucially, it is *not* allowed access to the microphone or location services, as these permissions are not required for its core function of photo editing. By restricting access to only what is essential, the potential harm if the application is compromised or behaves maliciously is significantly reduced, as it cannot, for instance, record conversations or track the user's location."
Illustrate the 'Separation of Privilege' principle with an example from a financial system.,"In a financial system, the 'Separation of Privilege' principle is illustrated by the process required for transferring large sums of money. To perform such a privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together. For instance, an employee might act as the 'initiator' by preparing and submitting the transfer request. However, this request cannot be executed solely by the initiator. It requires an additional approval from a manager, who acts as the 'reviewer.' This separation ensures that no single entity has full control over the critical process of transferring funds, minimizing the risk of misuse, error, or compromise."
How does 'Separation of Privilege' minimize risk in critical processes?,"'Separation of Privilege' minimizes risk in critical processes by ensuring that no single entity has full control over those processes. By requiring multiple parties or distinct roles to collaborate to perform a privileged action, it creates a system of checks and balances. This design makes it significantly harder for a single malicious actor, an accidental error by one individual, or the compromise of a single account to lead to a complete system breach or unauthorized action. It distributes responsibility, thereby reducing the potential for misuse, error, or compromise, and enhancing overall security."
What is the primary goal of 'Security Properties' for a system?,"The primary goal of 'Security Properties' for a system is to define the security goals that the system aims to achieve. These properties, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA model), along with others like Accountability and Non-repudiation, establish the fundamental requirements and objectives that a secure system must fulfill to protect its assets, data, and operations from various threats and attacks."
How does the 'Least of Privilege' principle prevent attacks related to unnecessary permissions?,"The 'Least of Privilege' principle prevents attacks related to unnecessary permissions by limiting the potential attack surface and impact. If an entity (user or program) is granted only the minimal permissions required for its task, then even if that entity is compromised by a malicious actor, the scope of damage or unauthorized actions that the attacker can perform is severely restricted. Granting unnecessary permissions provides a malicious entity with an avenue to abuse those elevated privileges to perform an attack, such as accessing sensitive data it shouldn't, modifying critical system files, or escalating its own privileges. By adhering to least privilege, such abuse is either prevented or its impact is greatly contained."
"What type of malware was used in the Target attack, and what was its function?","In the Target attack, the type of malware used was identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" which bore a strong resemblance to ""BlackPOS."" This malware functioned as a **RAM scraper**. Its specific purpose was to collect unencrypted payment card information directly from the memory of the Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals just after a card was swiped. This allowed the attackers to capture sensitive credit card data before it could be encrypted or securely processed, making it vulnerable to exfiltration."
How did the Target malware evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers?,"The Target malware, specifically ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" contained a new attack method that enabled it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. While the document doesn't detail the exact technical mechanisms, it highlights that this new method made the malware hard to detect. This suggests sophisticated techniques were employed to hide its presence on the system and obscure the exfiltration of collected credit card data, making it challenging for security researchers and forensic analysts to identify and trace its activities."
What is the significance of 'unforgeable evidence' in the context of security properties?,"The significance of 'unforgeable evidence' lies in the security property of **Non-repudiation**. Unforgeable evidence means that there is undeniable proof that a specific action occurred, and the entity responsible for that action cannot legitimately deny having performed it. This is crucial for establishing trust, accountability, and legal validity in digital transactions and communications. It ensures that participants in a system cannot falsely disclaim their involvement in an action, which is essential for auditing, dispute resolution, and maintaining the integrity of records."
How does 'Freshness' protect against replay attacks?,"'Freshness' protects against replay attacks by ensuring that data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. A replay attack involves an attacker capturing a legitimate message or data packet and then retransmitting it at a later time to achieve an unauthorized effect, such as re-executing a financial transaction or re-authenticating to a system. By incorporating mechanisms that guarantee freshness, such as unique timestamps, sequence numbers, or nonces (numbers used once), the system can detect and reject old or replayed messages, thereby preventing the attacker from exploiting previously valid communications."
What is the role of 'Verifiability' in building trust for system operations?,"The role of 'Verifiability' in building trust for system operations is to allow the system's operations to be independently verified. This means that external parties, auditors, or automated tools can inspect and confirm that the system is behaving correctly and securely, according to its design specifications and security policies. By enabling independent verification, verifiability provides an objective basis for trust, as it moves beyond simply accepting the system's internal claims of correctness. This transparency and ability to audit enhance confidence in the system's security posture and reliability."
Explain how 'Accountability' contributes to deterring malicious behavior.,"'Accountability' contributes to deterring malicious behavior by ensuring that the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. When individuals know that their actions within a system are logged and can be attributed to them, it creates a disincentive for engaging in unauthorized or malicious activities. The fear of being identified and facing consequences acts as a deterrent. Furthermore, in the event of a security incident, accountability allows for forensic analysis to pinpoint the source of the breach, which can lead to corrective actions and legal repercussions, further reinforcing the deterrent effect."
What is the purpose of 'Authenticity' in securing communications?,"The purpose of 'Authenticity' in securing communications is to ensure that the communicated entity is the correct entity. This means verifying the genuine identity of the sender, receiver, or the origin of the data being exchanged. In secure communications, authenticity prevents impersonation and ensures that parties are interacting with whom they believe they are interacting. For example, it confirms that a message truly came from the claimed sender and has not been spoofed, thereby building trust and preventing attacks that rely on false identities."
How does 'Fault tolerance' enhance system availability?,"'Fault tolerance' enhances system availability by allowing the system to continue functioning correctly despite failures. Instead of a single point of failure leading to a complete system outage, fault-tolerant designs incorporate redundancy and mechanisms to detect, isolate, and recover from component failures. This ensures that even if parts of the system experience issues (e.g., hardware malfunction, software crash), the overall system can maintain its operations, perhaps with degraded performance, but without becoming completely unavailable to authorized users. This resilience directly contributes to higher availability."
What are the key considerations for an attacker's capability regarding computing resources?,"For an attacker's capability, a key consideration regarding computing resources is how much computational power, storage, and network bandwidth they can leverage. The availability of significant computing resources enables an attacker to execute more complex and resource-intensive attacks. For example, ample computing power is crucial for brute-force attacks against passwords or encryption keys, while extensive network bandwidth is necessary for launching large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The extent of these resources directly impacts the feasibility and scale of potential attacks."
How do time constraints affect an attacker's strategy?,"Time constraints significantly affect an attacker's strategy by determining whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly. If an attacker has unlimited time, they can conduct thorough reconnaissance, patiently probe for vulnerabilities, develop custom exploits, and maintain a persistent presence within a system without immediate detection. Conversely, if an attacker needs to act quickly, they might resort to simpler, more readily available exploits, or less stealthy methods that carry a higher risk of detection but can achieve their objectives faster. The available time influences the sophistication, stealth, and persistence of an attack."
What is the significance of 'parts of the system an attacker can interact with' in assessing attacker capability?,"The significance of 'what parts of the system an attacker can interact with' in assessing attacker capability lies in defining the potential scope and impact of an attack. An attacker who can interact with critical system interfaces, internal components, or sensitive data stores has a much higher potential for causing damage, extracting valuable information, or gaining unauthorized control compared to an attacker limited to external, less privileged interfaces. This factor determines the attack surface and the level of access an attacker can achieve, directly influencing the severity of a potential breach."
Analyse the concept of 'disclosure' in the context of confidentiality.,"In the context of confidentiality, 'disclosure' refers to the act of revealing information to unauthorized parties. Confidentiality aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning that sensitive data should not be made accessible or known to individuals or systems that lack the proper authorization. Threats like eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying are all mechanisms that lead to unauthorized disclosure, as they facilitate the leakage of sensitive information to those who should not have access to it. Preventing such disclosure is the core objective of confidentiality."
What does 'modification' signify in relation to the integrity security property?,"In relation to the integrity security property, 'modification' signifies any unauthorized alteration or change to information, critical system state, or code. Integrity specifically aims to prevent unauthorized modification, ensuring that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by malicious parties. Actions such as intercepting data packets, changing their content, and then releasing them are examples of unauthorized modification that directly violate the integrity property, potentially leading to corrupted data, incorrect system behavior, or security vulnerabilities."
Explain 'withholding' in the context of the availability security property.,"In the context of the availability security property, 'withholding' refers to the act of preventing authorized users from accessing information or resources. Availability aims to prevent unauthorized withholding, meaning that legitimate users should always be able to access and utilize the system's resources and data when needed. Threats that cause withholding, such as disrupting services through denial-of-service attacks, directly undermine availability by making resources inaccessible to those who are authorized to use them, thereby preventing them from performing their legitimate tasks."
How does the 'Least of Privilege' principle apply to using root or admin accounts?,"The 'Least of Privilege' principle strongly advises against performing personal activities using root or administrator accounts in an operating system. Root or admin accounts possess extensive, system-wide privileges, allowing them to make critical changes, access any file, and control all processes. If a user performs routine, non-administrative tasks (like web browsing, email, or document editing) with such elevated privileges, any vulnerability exploited in those applications could grant an attacker full control over the entire system. By using a standard, unprivileged user account for daily activities, the potential harm from a compromise is significantly contained, as the attacker would only gain the limited privileges of that standard user."
What is the security benefit of a developer not being able to directly deploy code to production?,"The security benefit of a developer not being able to directly deploy code to production is a direct application of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle. This separation minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise. It prevents a single developer, whether intentionally malicious or accidentally introducing a bug, from unilaterally pushing unreviewed or flawed code into live systems. Instead, deployment is handled by a separate operations team, often after code reviews, testing, and approval processes. This multi-party control acts as a safeguard, enhancing the integrity and stability of the production environment and reducing the attack surface."
Analyse the concept of 'malicious entities' in the context of TCB size.,"The concept of 'malicious entities' in the context of TCB size refers to the potential threats that a system must defend against, particularly those residing outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). When designing a secure system with a smaller TCB, it becomes more challenging because the system needs to consider a greater number of components or actors as potentially malicious entities. In a larger TCB, some components might be implicitly trusted. However, with a smaller TCB, more parts of the overall system fall outside the trusted boundary, meaning they must be treated as untrusted and potentially hostile. This necessitates more robust security mechanisms and careful isolation between the TCB and these numerous 'malicious entities' to maintain overall system security."
How does the Target attack illustrate a failure in 'Confidentiality'?,"The Target attack illustrates a clear failure in 'Confidentiality' because it involved the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The ""Trojan.POSRAM"" malware specifically collected unencrypted payment card information from POS terminals. This data, which should have remained confidential and accessible only to authorized payment processing systems, was instead exfiltrated by the attackers. The subsequent transmission of this data to external servers (first a hijacked U.S. server, then to Russia) represents a direct breach of confidentiality, as sensitive customer financial details were leaked to unauthorized parties, leading to widespread financial fraud and identity theft."
What is the primary difference between 'Prevention' and 'Detection' security strategies?,"The primary difference between 'Prevention' and 'Detection' security strategies lies in their timing and objective. 'Prevention' aims to stop security incidents from occurring in the first place by implementing measures that prevent a system from being damaged. Its goal is to block attacks before they succeed. In contrast, 'Detection' focuses on identifying when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged. Its objective is to alert administrators to ongoing or past security incidents, rather than preventing them. Prevention is proactive, while detection is reactive in identifying incidents."
How does the 'Reaction' strategy acknowledge the inevitability of security incidents?,"The 'Reaction' security strategy explicitly acknowledges the inevitability of security incidents by operating on the assumption that ""bad things will happen."" This means that despite robust prevention and detection measures, a system may still be compromised or damaged. Therefore, the reaction strategy emphasizes preparing systems for the worst-case outcome. This involves developing plans and measures for recovery from damage, such as data backups, incident response protocols, and disaster recovery plans, ensuring that the system can restore functionality and minimize impact after a breach or failure."
What are the three main components of the 'Attacker's Assumption' model?,"The 'Attacker's Assumption' model is composed of three main components that characterize a potential adversary:

1.  **Type of attacker:** This categorizes attackers based on their operational methods, distinguishing between 'Active' attackers who manipulate or disrupt systems (e.g., modifying data, injecting code) and 'Passive' attackers who observe and gather information without interfering (e.g., eavesdropping).
2.  **Attacker's knowledge:** This describes the level of information the attacker possesses about the target system. It ranges from knowing the system's design, architecture, and source code to lacking detailed knowledge and relying on probing or trial and error.
3.  **Attacker's capability:** This assesses the resources and limitations of the attacker. It includes factors such as how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, what parts of the system they can interact with, and whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly."
"How does the 'KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle' apply to TCB design?","The 'KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle' applies to TCB design by advocating for a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB). A system with a smaller TCB is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made about its components. Simplicity in design, as promoted by KISS, inherently leads to fewer potential vulnerabilities and makes it easier to ensure the correctness and security of the critical TCB components. This principle suggests that by keeping the TCB as minimal and straightforward as possible, its security can be more effectively guaranteed."
What is the primary risk minimized by 'Separation of Privilege'?,"The primary risk minimized by 'Separation of Privilege' is the risk of misuse, error, or compromise stemming from a single point of control or decision. By requiring multiple parties or entities to collaborate for privileged actions, it prevents any single individual or compromised component from having unilateral authority over critical processes. This significantly reduces the chances of a single malicious actor, an accidental mistake, or a successful attack on one entity leading to a complete system breach or unauthorized operation."
Explain the concept of 'unauthorized disclosure' in the context of security.,"'Unauthorized disclosure' in the context of security refers to the act of making sensitive information accessible or known to individuals, entities, or systems that do not have the necessary permissions or authorization to view or possess it. This concept is central to the security property of **Confidentiality**. It encompasses various methods, such as eavesdropping, data leaks, or unauthorized access, where information that should be kept private is revealed to unintended recipients, thereby compromising its secrecy and potentially leading to harm."
What is the role of 'unauthorized modification' in violating system integrity?,"'Unauthorized modification' plays a critical role in violating system integrity by altering information, system state, or code without proper authorization. This concept is fundamental to the security property of **Integrity**. When unauthorized modifications occur, the trustworthiness and reliability of data and system operations are compromised. Such modifications can lead to incorrect data, corrupted system files, altered program behavior, or the introduction of vulnerabilities, all of which undermine the system's ability to function correctly and securely as intended."
How does 'unauthorized withholding' impact system availability?,"'Unauthorized withholding' directly impacts system availability by preventing authorized users from accessing the information or resources they need. This concept is central to the security property of **Availability**. When resources are withheld without authorization, legitimate users are unable to perform their tasks, access critical data, or utilize essential services. This can manifest as system downtime, slow performance, or complete inaccessibility, all of which disrupt normal operations and can lead to significant operational and financial losses."
What is the importance of 'tracing and identifying actions' in security?,"The importance of 'tracing and identifying actions' in security is paramount for the property of **Accountability**. This capability ensures that every action performed within a system can be attributed to a specific entity (user, process, or system component). This is crucial for several reasons: it deters malicious behavior by making actors aware their actions are not anonymous; it enables forensic investigations to determine the cause and scope of security incidents; and it supports auditing and compliance requirements by providing a clear record of system activities. Without the ability to trace and identify actions, it becomes impossible to hold entities responsible or learn from security events."
How does 'hiding personal information and identity' contribute to privacy?,"'Hiding personal information and identity' directly contributes to **Anonymity or privacy** as a security property. Its purpose is to prevent sensitive personal data and an individual's identity from being leaked to external parties or linked to their activities without consent. By obscuring or anonymizing this information, it protects individuals from surveillance, tracking, targeted attacks, and the misuse of their personal data. This is a fundamental aspect of respecting user privacy and complying with data protection regulations, ensuring that individuals can interact with systems without fear of unwarranted exposure."
What is the significance of 'current and not reused or replayed' data in communications?,"The significance of 'current and not reused or replayed' data in communications is directly tied to the security property of **Freshness**. This ensures that messages or data exchanges are unique and timely, preventing replay attacks. If data can be reused or replayed, an attacker could capture a legitimate communication and retransmit it later to achieve an unauthorized effect, such as re-executing a transaction or re-authenticating. By guaranteeing that data is current and not a replay, freshness mechanisms protect against such attacks, maintaining the integrity and validity of ongoing communications."
