Analyse the core design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The core design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable. \n\n**Unbypassable (completeness)** means there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This ensures that the TCB is the sole arbiter of security decisions. \n\n**Tamper-resistant (security)** dictates that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state, safeguarding its integrity. \n\n**Verifiable (or correctness)** implies that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This allows for assurance that the TCB operates as intended and correctly enforces security policies."
What insights can be derived from analyzing the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"Analyzing the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) reveals several insights regarding trustworthiness, verifiability, and design complexity. \n\nA system with a smaller TCB is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because fewer assumptions are needed, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This approach aligns with the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle**, which advocates for simplicity in design to enhance reliability and maintainability. \n\nConversely, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging. This increased challenge stems from the need to consider more malicious entities, as the smaller, more critical component must withstand a broader range of potential attacks."
Differentiate between an active and a passive attacker based on their type of actions.,"The distinction between an active and a passive attacker lies in their methods of interaction with the system. \n\nAn **active attacker** is one who manipulates or disrupts the systems. Examples of actions performed by an active attacker include modifying data or injecting code, directly interfering with the system's operation and integrity. \n\nA **passive attacker**, in contrast, focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. Their actions do not alter the system's state or data; instead, they aim to collect sensitive information through methods like eavesdropping."
Describe the different types of knowledge an attacker might possess regarding a system.,"An attacker's knowledge regarding a system can vary significantly, influencing their attack strategies. \n\nOne type of knowledge is a comprehensive understanding, where the attacker **knows the system's design, architecture, source code, etc.** This deep insight allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks. \n\nAlternatively, an attacker might **lack detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error**. In this scenario, the attacker attempts various methods to discover vulnerabilities or gain access, often through iterative testing and observation of system responses."
Analyse the common security properties defined by the CIA model.,"The common security properties defined by the CIA model are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which represent the security goals for a system. \n\n**Confidentiality (C)** aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. This means sensitive information should not be leaked to unauthorized parties. An example of a confidentiality breach is eavesdropping, packet sniffing, or illegal copying of data. \n\n**Integrity (I)** focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. Intercepting packets, modifying them, and then releasing them is an example of an integrity breach. \n\n**Availability (A)** seeks to prevent unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources should always be available for authorized users. Disrupting services is an example of an availability breach."
Explain the security property of Accountability and its significance.,"Accountability is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. Its significance lies in providing a record of who did what, which is crucial for auditing, forensic analysis, and deterring malicious activities. By being able to trace actions, system administrators can identify the source of security incidents and hold responsible parties accountable."
Define Non-repudiation and explain its purpose.,"Non-repudiation is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occur. This means an entity cannot deny having performed an action because there is irrefutable proof. The purpose of non-repudiation is to ensure that specific actions are backed by unforgeable evidence, preventing false denials of participation in a transaction or communication."
What is Authenticity in the context of security properties?,"Authenticity is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity. This means verifying the identity of a user, process, or system component to confirm that it is who or what it claims to be, thereby preventing impersonation and unauthorized access."
Explain the concept of Anonymity or privacy as a security property.,"Anonymity or privacy is a security property focused on hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. This property aims to protect sensitive personal data and ensure that individuals cannot be identified or tracked without their consent, thereby safeguarding their personal information from unauthorized disclosure."
Describe Verifiability as a security property.,"Verifiability is a security property that states the system's operations can be independently verified. This means that external parties or mechanisms can inspect and confirm that the system is functioning correctly and adhering to its specified security policies, providing assurance in its trustworthiness and correctness."
What does the security property of Freshness entail?,"Freshness is a security property that entails that the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed. This property is crucial for preventing replay attacks, where old, legitimate data or messages are retransmitted to trick a system into performing an unauthorized action or to gain unauthorized access. Ensuring freshness guarantees that interactions are timely and unique."
Analyse the security property of Fault tolerance.,"Fault tolerance is a security property that ensures the system can continue to function correctly despite failures. This property is critical for maintaining system availability and reliability, even when components fail or errors occur. A fault-tolerant system is designed to gracefully handle unexpected issues, preventing complete system outages and ensuring continuous operation."
Describe the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in the context of the Target attack case study.,"In the context of the Target attack case study, the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** refers to the Target computer system, including its operating system (OS) and hardware, which are considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware, is explicitly *not* trusted. This untrusted malicious software was responsible for leaking data to the attacker, highlighting a critical compromise within the trusted environment."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge identified in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge were significant. The attacker possessed the capability to launch malware, specifically 'Trojan.POSRAM,' on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. This malware was then used to collect credit card data stored in the database. The attacker's knowledge allowed them to deploy sophisticated malware that could collect unencrypted payment card information and evade forensic detection, indicating a deep understanding of system vulnerabilities and operational methods."
Which security property was primarily considered in the Target attack case study?,"The security property primarily considered in the Target attack case study was **Confidentiality**. The objective was protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically credit card data. \n\n**Confidentiality (C)** is defined as the prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. The attack directly violated this property by exfiltrating unencrypted payment card information."
Explain the Prevention strategy in security.,"The Prevention strategy in security involves taking measures that prevent your system from being damaged. This proactive approach focuses on implementing controls and safeguards to stop security incidents from occurring in the first place. Examples include firewalls, access controls, and encryption, all designed to block unauthorized actions or access before they can cause harm."
Describe the Detection strategy in security.,"The Detection strategy in security involves taking measures so that you can detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. This strategy focuses on identifying security incidents as they happen or after they have occurred. Tools and processes like intrusion detection systems, logging, and monitoring are employed to alert administrators to suspicious activities or breaches, providing the necessary information for response."
"What is the Reaction strategy in security, and what core assumption does it involve?","The Reaction strategy in security involves taking measures so that you can recover your system or recover from damage to your system. This strategy is about incident response and disaster recovery. \n\nA core assumption involved in the Reaction strategy is to **always assume that bad things will happen, and therefore prepare your systems for the worst-case outcome**. This proactive mindset ensures that organizations have plans and resources in place to minimize the impact of security incidents and restore operations efficiently."
Analyse the design principle of Least of Privilege.,"The design principle of **Least of Privilege** dictates that privileges should be assigned carefully to minimize potential harm. This principle involves several key aspects: \n\nFirst, it requires giving each entity the minimal permissions necessary to complete its task. This limits the scope of damage if an entity is compromised. \n\nSecond, privileges should be granted only when needed and revoked after use, preventing persistent elevated access. \n\nThird, the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can do if it goes awry or becomes subverted. This reduces the attack surface and potential impact of vulnerabilities. \n\nFinally, granting unnecessary permissions poses a significant risk, as a malicious entity could abuse those permissions to perform an attack. Adhering to this principle is crucial for robust security."
Provide examples illustrating the design principle of Least of Privilege.,"The design principle of Least of Privilege can be illustrated with practical examples: \n\nOne example is to **never perform personal activities using a root or admin account in an operating system (OS)**. By using a standard user account for daily tasks, the potential damage from malware or accidental errors is significantly reduced, as the standard account has fewer privileges. \n\nAnother example is a **photo editing application on a smartphone being only allowed access to the gallery but not the microphone or location**. This demonstrates that the application is granted only the permissions essential for its function, preventing it from accessing unrelated sensitive data or hardware components."
Analyse the design principle of Separation of Privilege.,"The design principle of **Separation of Privilege** focuses on splitting responsibility to enhance security. This principle ensures that to perform a privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision. \n\nThe primary goal is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. By distributing authority and requiring multiple approvals or actions, the system becomes more resilient to individual failures or malicious intent, as a compromise of one entity is insufficient to complete a critical operation."
Provide examples that demonstrate the design principle of Separation of Privilege.,"The design principle of Separation of Privilege is demonstrated through various real-world scenarios: \n\nIn a financial system, **transferring large sums of money requires approval from an employee (initiator) and additional approval from a manager (reviewer)**. This ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a significant financial transaction, thereby minimizing the risk of fraud or error. \n\nAnother example is where **a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production; deployment is handled by a separate operations team**. This separation prevents a single individual from introducing malicious or faulty code directly into the live system, requiring independent verification and action by another team."
What are the security goals that a system aims to achieve?,"The security goals that a system aims to achieve are broadly categorized under Security Properties. These properties include the common security properties defined by the CIA model—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—as well as other properties such as Accountability, Non-repudiation, Authenticity, Anonymity or privacy, Verifiability, Freshness, and Fault tolerance. Each of these properties represents a specific objective in protecting the system and its data from various threats and ensuring its reliable operation."
"Describe the process of data exfiltration in the Target attack, including the malware and its characteristics.","In the Target attack, the data exfiltration process involved the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware, which was a type of RAM scraper. This malware collected unencrypted payment card information just after it was swiped at Target and while it sat in a POS terminal's memory. \n\nOver two weeks, the malware collected 11GB of data from Target's POS terminals. The data was first quietly moved to another server on Target's network, then transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, and finally sent to a server in Russia. \n\nThe 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware bore a strong resemblance to 'BlackPOS,' another type of POS malware, but contained a new attack method that evaded forensic detection and concealed data transfers, making it hard to detect."
Compare and contrast the security properties of Verifiability and Accountability.,"Both Verifiability and Accountability are security properties related to ensuring correctness and traceability within a system, but they focus on different aspects. \n\n**Verifiability** ensures that the system's operations can be independently verified. This means that external checks can confirm that the system is functioning as intended and its processes are correct. \n\n**Accountability**, on the other hand, ensures that actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This property focuses on attributing specific actions to specific entities, providing a record for auditing and responsibility. \n\nWhile verifiability confirms *what* the system is doing is correct, accountability identifies *who* performed specific actions within the system."
"What are the implications of an attacker having unlimited time versus needing to act quickly, regarding their capabilities?","An attacker's time constraint significantly impacts their capabilities. If an attacker has **unlimited time**, they can leverage more extensive and persistent methods. This allows for prolonged probing, trial and error, and the development of more sophisticated attacks, as they are not pressured by detection windows or operational deadlines. \n\nConversely, if an attacker **needs to act quickly**, their capabilities are constrained. They might have to rely on faster, potentially less subtle methods, or exploit readily available vulnerabilities, as they have limited time for reconnaissance or complex attack execution. This time pressure can influence the choice of attack vectors and the overall stealth of their operations."
Analyse the relationship between a smaller TCB and the KISS principle.,"The relationship between a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle** is direct and beneficial for system security. \n\nA system with a smaller TCB is inherently more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB implies less complexity, fewer lines of code, and a reduced number of components, which in turn means fewer assumptions need to be made about its behavior. When fewer assumptions are made, there are fewer opportunities for those assumptions to be violated, leading to a more robust and predictable system. \n\nThis aligns perfectly with the KISS principle, which advocates for simplicity in design to enhance reliability and maintainability. By keeping the TCB small and simple, the overall security posture of the system is improved due to reduced attack surface and increased ease of auditing and verification."
What are the potential risks if a program with unnecessary permissions goes awry or becomes subverted?,"If a program with unnecessary permissions goes awry or becomes subverted, the potential risks are significantly amplified. The design principle of Least of Privilege highlights that the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can do. \n\nConversely, if a program is granted permissions beyond what is strictly necessary for its task, a malicious entity could abuse those excessive permissions to perform a wider range of attacks. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical system components, or disruption of services, far exceeding the damage that would be possible if the program had only its minimal required privileges."
"How does the principle of Separation of Privilege minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise?","The principle of Separation of Privilege minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. Instead, to perform a privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than a single point of control or decision. \n\nThis distributed control acts as a safeguard: \n\n*   **Misuse:** It prevents a single malicious actor from unilaterally performing unauthorized actions. \n*   **Error:** It introduces checks and balances, as multiple individuals must review or approve an action, reducing the chance of a single person's mistake leading to a critical failure. \n*   **Compromise:** If one entity is compromised, it does not automatically grant the attacker sufficient power to complete a critical operation, as other entities would still need to provide their part of the authorization or action."
Describe the three main security strategies for a system.,"The three main security strategies for a system are Prevention, Detection, and Reaction. \n\n**Prevention** involves taking measures that prevent your system from being damaged. This is a proactive approach focused on stopping incidents before they occur. \n\n**Detection** involves taking measures so that you can detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. This strategy focuses on identifying security events and breaches. \n\n**Reaction** involves taking measures so that you can recover your system or recover from damage to your system. This strategy includes incident response and recovery plans, operating under the assumption that bad things will happen and preparing for the worst-case outcome."
"What is the primary objective of Confidentiality in the CIA model, and what are common ways it can be breached?",The primary objective of **Confidentiality (C)** in the CIA model is to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. This means ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. \n\nCommon ways confidentiality can be breached include: \n\n*   **Eavesdropping:** Covertly listening to private communications. \n*   **Packet sniffing:** Intercepting and analyzing data packets traveling over a network. \n*   **Illegal copying:** Unauthorized duplication of data or files.
"What is the primary objective of Integrity in the CIA model, and how can it be compromised?","The primary objective of **Integrity (I)** in the CIA model is to prevent unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties, thereby maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data. \n\nIntegrity can be compromised through actions such as intercepting packets, modifying their content, and then releasing them. This type of attack directly alters data in transit or at rest, leading to unreliable or incorrect information within the system."
"What is the primary objective of Availability in the CIA model, and what are common ways it can be violated?","The primary objective of **Availability (A)** in the CIA model is to prevent unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources should always be available for authorized users when needed. \n\nAvailability can be violated by actions that disrupt services. This means that legitimate users are prevented from accessing the system or its resources, often through attacks that overload the system or disable its components, making the information or service inaccessible."
How does the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware in the Target attack demonstrate a breach of confidentiality?,"The 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware in the Target attack directly demonstrates a breach of **Confidentiality** by collecting unencrypted payment card information from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. \n\nConfidentiality is the security property that prevents unauthorized disclosure of information. The malware acted as a RAM scraper, extracting sensitive customer credit card data from the POS terminal's memory and subsequently exfiltrating 11GB of this data to external servers, thereby leaking sensitive information to unauthorized parties and violating the confidentiality of customer data."
What role do an attacker's computing resources play in their overall capability?,"An attacker's computing resources play a significant role in their overall capability by determining the scale and complexity of attacks they can leverage. \n\nMore computing resources allow an attacker to perform actions such as brute-force attacks more quickly, process larger amounts of stolen data, or run more sophisticated malware and exploit tools. Conversely, limited computing resources might restrict an attacker to simpler, less resource-intensive methods, impacting their ability to launch large-scale or computationally demanding attacks."
Explain the concept of 'unbypassable' as a TCB design principle.,"The concept of 'unbypassable' as a TCB design principle, also referred to as **completeness**, means that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). This principle ensures that all security-relevant operations and decisions must pass through the TCB. If there were a way to circumvent the TCB, an attacker could bypass its security controls, rendering the entire security mechanism ineffective. Therefore, completeness is fundamental to the TCB's role as the trusted core of a system's security."
"What does 'tamper-resistant' mean for a TCB, and why is it important?","'Tamper-resistant' for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also referred to as **security**, means that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state. \n\nIt is important because if external, untrusted components could alter the TCB, they could compromise its integrity and subvert its security functions. This principle ensures that the TCB remains a reliable and uncorrupted foundation for the system's security, preventing unauthorized changes that could lead to breaches."
Explain the 'verifiable' principle for TCB design.,"The 'verifiable' principle for Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, also referred to as **correctness**, means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This principle implies that the TCB's design, implementation, and operation can be rigorously examined and proven to function as intended, without flaws or vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Verifiability provides assurance that the TCB accurately enforces security policies and does not introduce unintended security weaknesses."
"How does the Target attack illustrate the importance of considering malicious software as untrusted, even within a trusted system?","The Target attack clearly illustrates the importance of considering malicious software as untrusted, even when it operates within a system where the operating system (OS) and hardware are considered part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). In this case, the Target computer system, including its OS and hardware, was initially trusted. However, the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware, which was malicious software, was *not* trusted. This untrusted software was able to compromise the system by collecting and leaking sensitive credit card data. This highlights that even if the underlying hardware and OS are deemed secure, the introduction of malicious software can subvert the entire system's security, emphasizing the need to extend the 'untrusted' scope to all potentially harmful applications."
What are the implications of an attacker's ability to interact with different parts of a system?,"An attacker's ability to interact with different parts of a system has significant implications for their attack strategy and potential impact. If an attacker can interact with critical or sensitive parts of the system, they have a greater opportunity to cause damage, extract sensitive information, or gain further control. \n\nConversely, if an attacker's interaction is limited to non-critical or isolated parts, the potential harm is reduced. Understanding which parts of the system an attacker can interact with helps in identifying the attack surface and prioritizing security measures for the most vulnerable or valuable components."
Discuss the role of 'probing or trial and error' when an attacker lacks detailed system knowledge.,"When an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system's design, architecture, or source code, they must rely on **probing or trial and error** to achieve their objectives. This approach involves systematically testing various inputs, commands, or interactions with the system to observe its responses and identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses. \n\nThrough this iterative process, the attacker attempts to gather enough information to understand the system's behavior, discover exploitable flaws, or bypass security controls. While less efficient than having prior detailed knowledge, probing and trial and error can still be effective, especially against systems with unknown vulnerabilities or weak defenses."
How does the principle of Least Privilege contribute to minimizing the attack surface?,"The principle of Least Privilege contributes to minimizing the attack surface by restricting the permissions granted to any entity—whether a user, program, or process—to only those absolutely essential for it to perform its designated task. \n\nBy limiting privileges, the potential impact of a compromised entity is significantly reduced. If an attacker gains control of a component operating with minimal privileges, they cannot leverage that component to access unrelated sensitive data or execute unauthorized system-wide commands. This effectively shrinks the 'surface' an attacker can exploit, as even a successful breach of a low-privilege component yields limited opportunities for further compromise, thereby containing potential damage."
Explain how the Target attack's malware evaded forensic detection.,"The malware used in the Target attack, 'Trojan.POSRAM,' contained a new attack method that specifically evaded forensic detection and concealed data transfers. While the document notes its resemblance to 'BlackPOS,' this new method made it harder to detect. This suggests that the malware was designed with sophisticated techniques to hide its presence and operations from security analysts and tools, allowing it to remain undetected for an extended period (over two weeks) while collecting sensitive data."
What is the significance of the data being 'unencrypted' in the Target attack?,"The significance of the data being 'unencrypted' in the Target attack is critical because it meant that once the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware collected the payment card information, it was immediately readable and usable by the attackers. \n\n**Confidentiality**, a key security property, aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. If the data had been encrypted, even if collected by the malware, it would have been rendered unintelligible without the corresponding decryption key, thus preserving its confidentiality. The fact that it was unencrypted made the exfiltrated 11GB of data directly exploitable by the attackers, leading to a severe breach of sensitive customer information."
Discuss the implications of the Target attack data being moved to a server in Russia.,"The implications of the Target attack data being moved to a server in Russia, after first being moved within Target's network and then to a hijacked U.S.-based server, highlight the international scope and complexity of cyberattacks. This multi-stage exfiltration process suggests an attempt to obscure the ultimate destination of the stolen data and the identity of the attackers. \n\nSuch international transfers complicate forensic investigations, legal jurisdiction, and recovery efforts, making it more challenging to trace the perpetrators and retrieve the compromised information. It underscores the global nature of cyber threats and the difficulty in containing data once it leaves the initial compromised system."
How does the principle of Separation of Privilege relate to preventing a 'single point of control or decision'?,"The principle of Separation of Privilege directly relates to preventing a 'single point of control or decision' by requiring multiple parties to work together to perform a privileged action. Instead of one individual or entity having complete authority over a critical process, this principle mandates that several distinct entities must contribute their part to authorize or execute an action. \n\nThis design minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise because no single entity can unilaterally make or approve a critical decision. It creates a system of checks and balances, ensuring that a lapse in judgment, a mistake, or a malicious intent from one party cannot lead to a complete security failure."
What is the primary purpose of the 'Assign privileges carefully' guideline within the Least of Privilege principle?,"The primary purpose of the 'Assign privileges carefully' guideline within the Least of Privilege principle is to ensure that each entity is given only the minimal permissions required to complete its specific task. This careful assignment prevents over-privileging, which is a significant security risk. By limiting permissions, the potential damage that can be caused if an entity is compromised or behaves unexpectedly is severely restricted, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the system."
Explain the difference between 'unauthorized disclosure' and 'unauthorized modification' in terms of security properties.,"The difference between 'unauthorized disclosure' and 'unauthorized modification' lies in the specific security properties they violate. \n\n**Unauthorized disclosure** is a violation of **Confidentiality (C)**. It refers to sensitive information being revealed or leaked to parties who are not authorized to access it. Examples include eavesdropping or illegal copying. \n\n**Unauthorized modification** is a violation of **Integrity (I)**. It refers to information or system state being altered or changed by parties who do not have the authority to do so. An example is intercepting and changing data packets before releasing them. \n\nEssentially, disclosure is about *who sees* the information, while modification is about *who changes* the information."
"How do the security strategies of Prevention, Detection, and Reaction work together?","The security strategies of Prevention, Detection, and Reaction work together as a comprehensive framework to manage security risks throughout the lifecycle of a potential incident. \n\n**Prevention** acts as the first line of defense, aiming to stop security incidents from occurring in the first place by implementing proactive measures. \n\nIf prevention fails, **Detection** mechanisms are in place to identify when, how, and by whom the system has been damaged, providing crucial information about the breach. \n\nFinally, **Reaction** strategies come into play after an incident is detected, focusing on recovering the system from damage and minimizing the impact. Together, these strategies form a layered defense, where each compensates for the potential shortcomings of the others, ensuring a robust security posture that anticipates, identifies, and responds to threats."
What is a 'RAM scraper' and how was it utilized in the Target attack?,"A **RAM scraper** is a type of malware that collects unencrypted payment card information directly from a Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal's memory (RAM). \n\nIn the Target attack, the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware was identified as a RAM scraper. It was utilized to collect unencrypted payment card information just after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory. This allowed the attackers to capture sensitive financial data in its most vulnerable state before it could be encrypted or securely processed, leading to the exfiltration of millions of credit card numbers."
What are the implications of a system with a smaller TCB being more challenging to design securely?,"The implication of a system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) being more challenging to design securely is that despite its benefits in trustworthiness and verifiability, the design process itself requires greater rigor and attention to detail. This challenge arises because with a smaller TCB, designers need to consider more malicious entities. This means the critical, compact core of the system must be exceptionally robust and resilient against a wider array of potential threats and attack vectors, demanding a more intensive and meticulous security engineering effort."
How does the principle of Least Privilege relate to revoking privileges after use?,"The principle of Least Privilege explicitly states that privileges should be given when needed and revoked after use. This guideline is crucial because it prevents the accumulation of unnecessary permissions over time. By revoking privileges once a task is completed, the window of opportunity for a malicious entity to abuse those privileges is significantly reduced. This dynamic management of permissions ensures that an entity only possesses elevated access for the shortest possible duration, thereby minimizing the attack surface and potential for compromise."
Explain how the 'Disrupt services' action relates to a specific security property.,"The 'Disrupt services' action directly relates to a violation of the **Availability (A)** security property. \n\nAvailability is defined as preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources, ensuring that resources are always available for authorized users. When services are disrupted, authorized users are prevented from accessing the system or its resources, which is a direct contravention of the availability goal. This can be caused by various attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, aiming to make a system or network resource unavailable to its legitimate users."
What is the significance of the Target attack malware being similar to 'BlackPOS' but having a new attack method?,"The significance of the Target attack malware, 'Trojan.POSRAM,' being similar to 'BlackPOS' but containing a new attack method lies in its enhanced sophistication and ability to bypass existing defenses. While 'BlackPOS' was a known type of POS malware, the new attack method in 'Trojan.POSRAM' specifically enabled it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. This evolution allowed the attackers to operate undetected for over two weeks, highlighting the continuous arms race in cybersecurity where attackers adapt and innovate to circumvent established security measures and detection techniques."
How does the 'Always assume that bad things will happen' mindset contribute to security strategies?,"The 'Always assume that bad things will happen' mindset is a fundamental contribution to effective security strategies, particularly within the Reaction strategy. This proactive assumption encourages organizations to prepare their systems for the worst-case outcome. Instead of solely relying on prevention, this mindset ensures that resources, plans, and procedures are in place for incident response and recovery. It acknowledges the reality that no system is entirely impenetrable, thereby fostering a resilient security posture that can effectively minimize damage and restore operations when incidents inevitably occur."
