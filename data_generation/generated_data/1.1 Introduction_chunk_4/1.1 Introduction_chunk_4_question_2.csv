What are the design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are:

1.  **Unbypassable (completeness):** There must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB.
2.  **Tamper-resistant (security):** The TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state.
3.  **Verifiable (or correctness):** It should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB."
Explain the concept of an 'Unbypassable' TCB.,"An 'Unbypassable' TCB, also referred to as completeness, means that there must be no possible method to breach the system's security by circumventing or bypassing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). The TCB must be an inescapable component of the security architecture."
What does 'Tamper-resistant' mean in the context of TCB design?,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, 'Tamper-resistant,' also known as security, means that the TCB must be protected against interference from other parts of the system that are outside the TCB itself. These external parts are prevented from modifying the TCB's code or its operational state, ensuring its integrity."
Why is it important for a TCB to be 'Verifiable'?,"It is important for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to be 'Verifiable,' also referred to as correctness, because it should be possible to confirm and prove the TCB's correctness. This ability to verify ensures that the TCB operates as intended and meets its security objectives."
How does the size of a TCB relate to its trustworthiness and verifiability?,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions, which reduces the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This approach aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle."
What is the KISS principle and how does it apply to TCB design?,"The KISS principle, which stands for ""Keep It Simple, Stupid,"" suggests that systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. In TCB design, this principle applies by advocating for a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB). A smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made, thereby minimizing potential vulnerabilities."
What challenges arise when designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"When designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the primary challenge is that it becomes more difficult. This is because a smaller TCB necessitates considering a greater number of malicious entities and potential attack vectors, as the trusted core is minimized, requiring more rigorous security considerations for the surrounding components."
What are the different types of attackers based on their actions?,"Based on their actions, there are two main types of attackers:

1.  **Active attacker:** This type of attacker manipulates or disrupts systems. Examples include modifying data or injecting code.
2.  **Passive attacker:** This type of attacker focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation."
Differentiate between an active and a passive attacker.,"An **active attacker** is characterized by their intent to manipulate or disrupt systems, which can involve actions such as modifying data or injecting malicious code. In contrast, a **passive attacker** aims to observe and gather information without actively interfering with or altering the system's operations."
What kind of knowledge might an attacker possess about a system?,"An attacker's knowledge about a system can vary. They might possess detailed knowledge, including the system's design, architecture, and source code. Alternatively, they might lack such detailed knowledge and instead rely on probing the system or using trial and error to gain information."
What factors define an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's capability is defined by several factors:

1.  **Computing resources:** How much computing power and resources the attacker can leverage.
2.  **System interaction:** What specific parts of the system the attacker can interact with.
3.  **Time constraints:** Whether the attacker has unlimited time to carry out an attack or needs to act quickly."
What are the security goals aimed for in a system?,The security goals aimed for in a system are known as Security Properties. These properties define the objectives that the system strives to achieve to maintain its security posture.
What are the common security properties described by the CIA model?,"The common security properties described by the CIA model are:

1.  **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive data is not leaked to unauthorized parties.
2.  **Integrity (I):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties.
3.  **Availability (A):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources are always available for authorized users."
Define Confidentiality in the context of security properties.,Confidentiality (C) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. Its purpose is to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to or accessed by unauthorized parties.
What is the definition of Integrity as a security property?,"Integrity (I) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code remain unaltered by malicious parties, thereby maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data and system operations."
Explain Availability as a security property.,Availability (A) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that the system's resources and information are consistently accessible and available for use by authorized users whenever needed.
What are some examples of actions that breach Confidentiality?,"Actions that breach Confidentiality include eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying of information. These activities involve unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data."
How can Integrity be breached?,"Integrity can be breached through actions such as intercepting packets, modifying their content, and then releasing them. This process involves unauthorized alteration of information, compromising its accuracy and trustworthiness."
What constitutes a breach of Availability?,"A breach of Availability occurs when services are disrupted, preventing authorized users from accessing information or resources. This constitutes unauthorized withholding of necessary system functions."
List other important security properties beyond the CIA model.,"Beyond the CIA model, other important security properties include:

*   **Accountability:** Actions of an entity can be traced and identified.
*   **Non-repudiation:** Unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred.
*   **Authenticity:** Ensure the communicated entity is the correct entity.
*   **Anonymity or privacy:** Hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties.
*   **Verifiability:** The system's operations can be independently verified.
*   **Freshness:** The data or communications are current and not reused or replayed.
*   **Fault tolerance:** The system can continue to function correctly despite failures."
What is Accountability in the context of security properties?,"Accountability is a security property that ensures the actions performed by an entity within a system can be traced and identified. This allows for tracking who did what, which is crucial for auditing and forensics."
Define Non-repudiation as a security property.,"Non-repudiation is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. This prevents an entity from falsely denying that they performed a particular action, ensuring responsibility and trust in transactions."
What does Authenticity mean for security properties?,"Authenticity, as a security property, means ensuring that the communicated entity is indeed the correct and genuine entity it claims to be. It verifies the identity of users, systems, or data sources."
Explain Anonymity or privacy as a security property.,Anonymity or privacy is a security property focused on hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. It ensures that an individual's identity or sensitive data is protected from unauthorized disclosure.
What is Verifiability in the context of system operations?,"Verifiability, in the context of system operations, is a security property that means the system's operations can be independently verified. This allows for external confirmation that the system is functioning correctly and securely as intended."
What is the purpose of Freshness as a security property?,"The purpose of Freshness as a security property is to ensure that data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. This prevents attacks where old, legitimate messages are retransmitted to achieve an unauthorized effect."
How does Fault tolerance contribute to system security?,Fault tolerance contributes to system security by ensuring that the system can continue to function correctly and provide its services despite the occurrence of failures. This resilience helps maintain availability and integrity even when components fail.
Describe the Trusted Computing Base in the Target attack threat model.,"In the Target attack threat model, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) includes the Target computer system, specifically its operating system (OS) and hardware, which are considered trusted components. However, the malicious software involved in the attack is explicitly *not* trusted, as it is responsible for leaking data to the attacker."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge assumed in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge assumed were that the attacker could launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was capable of collecting credit card data stored in the database."
Which security property was primarily considered in the Target attack threat model?,"The security property primarily considered in the Target attack threat model was confidentiality. The focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically credit card data, to unauthorized parties."
"What type of malware was used in the Target attack, and what was its function?","The type of malware used in the Target attack was identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" which is a RAM scraper. Its function was to collect unencrypted payment card information immediately after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory."
How did the Target malware evade forensic detection?,"The Target malware, while similar to ""BlackPOS,"" contained a new attack method that enabled it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers, making it difficult to detect its presence and activities."
What are the three main security strategies?,"The three main security strategies are:

1.  **Prevention:** Taking measures that prevent your system from being damaged.
2.  **Detection:** Taking measures so that you can detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged.
3.  **Reaction:** Taking measures so that you can recover your system or recover from damage to your system."
What is the goal of the 'Prevention' security strategy?,The goal of the 'Prevention' security strategy is to implement measures that actively stop or hinder a system from being damaged. This involves proactive steps to avoid security incidents.
Explain the 'Detection' security strategy.,"The 'Detection' security strategy involves implementing measures designed to identify when a system has been damaged, how the damage occurred, and by whom it was inflicted. The objective is to gain visibility into security incidents after they happen."
What is the purpose of the 'Reaction' security strategy?,The purpose of the 'Reaction' security strategy is to implement measures that enable the recovery of a system from damage. This strategy also includes the principle of always assuming that negative events will occur and preparing systems for the worst-case outcome to facilitate recovery.
What is the core principle of 'Least of Privilege'?,The core principle of 'Least of Privilege' is to assign privileges carefully by giving each entity only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task. This minimizes the potential harm if a program goes awry or is subverted.
How should privileges be assigned according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, privileges should be assigned carefully by:

1.  Giving each entity only the minimal permissions required to complete its specific task.
2.  Granting privileges only when they are needed and revoking them immediately after use.
3.  Ensuring that the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can inflict if it malfunctions or is compromised.
4.  Avoiding the granting of unnecessary permissions, as these can be abused by malicious entities to perform attacks."
Why is it important to revoke privileges after use under the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"It is important to revoke privileges after use under the 'Least of Privilege' principle to minimize the window of opportunity for abuse. By removing permissions once they are no longer needed, the potential for a malicious entity to exploit those permissions to perform an attack is significantly reduced."
Provide an example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for an operating system.,"An example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for an operating system is never performing personal activities while logged in using a root or administrator account. These accounts possess elevated privileges that are unnecessary for routine tasks, and using them for such activities increases the risk of system compromise if the account is exploited."
Give an example of 'Least of Privilege' for a smartphone application.,"An example of 'Least of Privilege' for a smartphone application is a photo editing application that is only granted access to the device's gallery. It is explicitly *not* allowed access to the microphone or location services, as these permissions are unnecessary for its core function and could be abused if granted."
What is the main idea behind the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle?,"The main idea behind the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle is to split responsibility for privileged actions. Instead of a single point of control or decision, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise a privilege. This minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring no single entity has full control over critical processes."
How does 'Separation of Privilege' minimize risk?,"'Separation of Privilege' minimizes risk by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. By requiring multiple parties to work together to perform a privileged action, it reduces the likelihood of misuse, error, or compromise, as collusion or multiple failures would be necessary for a breach."
Provide a financial system example of 'Separation of Privilege'.,"In a financial system, an example of 'Separation of Privilege' is when transferring large sums of money. This action requires approval from an employee, who acts as the initiator, and an additional approval from a manager, who serves as the reviewer. This ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a significant financial transaction."
How is 'Separation of Privilege' applied in software development and deployment?,"In software development and deployment, 'Separation of Privilege' is applied by ensuring that a developer who writes code cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, the deployment process is handled by a separate operations team. This separation prevents a single individual from having complete control over both code creation and its release into live environments, reducing risks of errors or malicious changes."
What is the primary benefit of splitting responsibility in 'Separation of Privilege'?,"The primary benefit of splitting responsibility in 'Separation of Privilege' is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise. By requiring multiple parties to collaborate for privileged actions, it prevents any single entity from having full control over critical processes, thereby enhancing security and accountability."
What is the relationship between a smaller TCB and the number of assumptions needed for verification?,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) requires fewer assumptions for verification. This is beneficial because it reduces the chances of those assumptions being violated, making the system more trustworthy and easier to verify its correctness."
What does 'modifying data' signify in the context of an active attacker?,"In the context of an active attacker, 'modifying data' signifies an action where the attacker alters information within a system. This is a form of disruption aimed at changing the system's state or the integrity of its data."
What is 'injecting code' as an active attacker's action?,'Injecting code' as an active attacker's action refers to the act of introducing malicious programming instructions into a system. This allows the attacker to manipulate or disrupt the system's intended operations by executing their own code.
What does a passive attacker aim to do without interfering with the system?,"A passive attacker aims to observe and gather information without interfering with the system. Their objective is to collect data, such as communications or system states, without making any changes that would alert detection or alter the system's normal operation."
Why is it crucial for security to know what parts of the system an attacker can interact with?,"It is crucial for security to know what parts of the system an attacker can interact with because this knowledge defines the attacker's capability and potential attack surface. Understanding these interaction points allows for targeted defenses and risk assessment, as these are the pathways through which an attacker can attempt to compromise the system."
What is the significance of an attacker's time constraints in a threat model?,"The significance of an attacker's time constraints in a threat model lies in understanding whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly. This factor influences the types of attacks they might employ, the resources they can expend, and the complexity of their methods, which in turn informs defensive strategies."
How does the CIA model relate to the security goals for a system?,"The CIA model (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) directly relates to the security goals for a system by defining the fundamental properties that the system aims to achieve. These three properties represent the core objectives for protecting information and resources within the system."
What is the difference between 'Accountability' and 'Non-repudiation'?,"**Accountability** ensures that the actions of an entity can be traced and identified, allowing for a record of who did what. **Non-repudiation**, on the other hand, provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred, preventing an entity from falsely denying their involvement in those actions."
How does 'Anonymity or privacy' differ from 'Confidentiality'?,"**Anonymity or privacy** specifically focuses on hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties, protecting the individual. **Confidentiality** is a broader concept that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of *any* information, sensitive or otherwise, not just personal identity."
What was the initial destination of the stolen credit card data from Target's network?,"The stolen credit card data from Target's network was initially moved to another server on Target's own network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, before ultimately being sent to a server in Russia."
"What was the name of the malware similar to Trojan.POSRAM, and when was it used by cyberattackers?","The malware similar to Trojan.POSRAM was named ""BlackPOS."" Cyberattackers were using BlackPOS as far back as March 2013."
What is the general approach to preparing systems for potential damage according to security strategies?,"According to security strategies, the general approach to preparing systems for potential damage is to always assume that bad things will happen. Therefore, systems should be prepared for the worst-case outcome, which is part of the 'Reaction' strategy."
