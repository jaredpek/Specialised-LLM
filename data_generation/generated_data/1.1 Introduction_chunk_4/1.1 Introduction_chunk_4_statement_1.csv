List and define the three core design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The three core design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable.\n\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible method to breach the system's security by circumventing the TCB. The TCB must be a mandatory component in all security-relevant operations.\n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** The TCB must be protected against any unauthorized modifications from other parts of the system that exist outside the TCB. These external components are explicitly prevented from altering the TCB's code or its operational state.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** It must be feasible to verify the correctness of the TCB's implementation and operation. This ensures that the TCB behaves as expected and upholds its security guarantees."
Explain the 'Unbypassable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Unbypassable' principle, also known as completeness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design means that there must be absolutely no way to breach the system's security by circumventing or bypassing the TCB. All security-critical operations and data flows must necessarily pass through and be controlled by the TCB, ensuring it acts as the sole enforcement point for security policies."
What does 'Tamper-resistant' mean in the context of TCB security?,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) security, 'Tamper-resistant,' also referred to as security, signifies that the TCB must be protected against unauthorized interference from other parts of the system that reside outside the TCB. These external components are explicitly prohibited from modifying the TCB's code or its internal state, thereby preserving its integrity and operational correctness."
Define the 'Verifiable' principle for TCB design.,"The 'Verifiable' principle, also known as correctness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation can be rigorously examined and proven to function as intended, ensuring its reliability in enforcing security policies."
Discuss the implications of the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) on system trustworthiness and design.,"The size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) has significant implications for system trustworthiness and design. A system with a smaller TCB is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its correctness, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This approach aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, advocating for simplicity to reduce complexity and potential vulnerabilities.\n\nConversely, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging. This is because a smaller TCB implies that more components outside the TCB are untrusted, requiring designers to consider a broader range of potential malicious entities and attack vectors that could interact with or attempt to compromise the system."
"How does the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle relate to the size of a TCB?","The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle relates to the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by advocating for a smaller TCB. A system with a smaller TCB is inherently simpler, which makes it more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because fewer assumptions need to be made about its correctness, reducing the potential for errors or vulnerabilities that could arise from complex interactions or unverified components. By keeping the TCB simple, the overall security posture of the system is enhanced."
What challenges arise when designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"When designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the primary challenge is the need to consider more malicious entities. A smaller TCB implies that a larger portion of the system is considered untrusted. This necessitates a more comprehensive analysis of potential threats and attack vectors originating from these untrusted components, making the overall security design process more complex and demanding in terms of identifying and mitigating risks."
Describe the two main types of attackers based on their interaction with systems.,"Based on their interaction with systems, there are two main types of attackers: Active and Passive.\n\n*   **Active attackers:** These attackers manipulate or disrupt systems. Examples of their actions include modifying data, injecting malicious code, or altering system operations to achieve their objectives.\n*   **Passive attackers:** These attackers focus on observing and gathering information from a system without interfering with its operations. Their goal is typically to collect sensitive data or intelligence without being detected."
Define an 'Active' attacker and provide examples of their actions.,"An 'Active' attacker is a type of adversary who manipulates or disrupts systems. Their actions are characterized by direct interference with the system's operations. Examples of such actions include modifying data, injecting malicious code into the system, or altering the normal flow of system processes."
"What is a 'Passive' attacker, and how do they operate?","A 'Passive' attacker is an adversary who operates by observing and gathering information from a system without interfering with its operations. Their primary goal is to collect data or intelligence, such as sensitive communications or system states, without leaving a trace or altering the system's functionality."
What are the two primary assumptions regarding an attacker's knowledge about a system?,"The two primary assumptions regarding an attacker's knowledge about a system are:\n\n1.  **Knowledge of system internals:** The attacker may possess detailed knowledge of the system's design, architecture, source code, and other internal workings.\n2.  **Lack of detailed knowledge:** Alternatively, the attacker may lack detailed knowledge and, in such cases, must rely on probing, trial and error, or other exploratory methods to understand and exploit the system."
List the key factors that define an attacker's capability.,"The key factors that define an attacker's capability include:\n\n*   **Computing resources:** How much computing power and infrastructure the attacker can leverage.\n*   **System interaction:** What specific parts of the system the attacker can interact with, indicating their access level and potential points of entry.\n*   **Time constraints:** Whether the attacker has unlimited time to conduct their operations or if they need to act quickly, which can influence the sophistication and duration of their attacks."
What is the overarching goal of defining security properties for a system?,The overarching goal of defining security properties for a system is to establish the specific security goals that the system aims to achieve. These properties serve as fundamental requirements that the system must satisfy to be considered secure against various threats and attacks.
Define the Common Security Properties (CIA model).,"The Common Security Properties, often referred to as the CIA model, are a foundational set of security goals that systems aim to achieve. CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, each representing a critical aspect of information security:\n\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive data is not leaked to unauthorized parties.\n*   **Integrity (I):** This property focuses on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system states and code cannot be altered by malicious parties, maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data.\n*   **Availability (A):** This property seeks to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources are always accessible and available for authorized users when needed."
Explain the security property of Confidentiality (C).,Confidentiality (C) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. Its core objective is to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. This means that only individuals or systems with appropriate authorization should be able to access or view specific data.
What is the security property of Integrity (I)?,"Integrity (I) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system states and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. This property is crucial for maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and trustworthiness of data and system operations, guaranteeing that information remains unaltered from its original, intended form."
Describe the security property of Availability (A).,Availability (A) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. Its primary goal is to ensure that resources are always accessible and available for authorized users when they are needed. This property is critical for ensuring that legitimate users can reliably access and utilize system services and data without interruption.
What are some common threats that compromise Confidentiality?,"Common threats that compromise Confidentiality include eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying. These activities involve unauthorized interception or duplication of information, leading to its disclosure to unauthorized parties."
How can Integrity be compromised?,"Integrity can be compromised through actions such as intercepting packets, modifying them, and then releasing them. This process involves an unauthorized party altering data in transit or at rest, leading to unauthorized modification of information and potentially critical system states or code."
What actions can disrupt Availability?,"Availability can be disrupted by actions that prevent authorized users from accessing information or resources. The primary action mentioned is disrupting services, which makes the system or its resources inaccessible to legitimate users."
Define the security property of Accountability.,"Accountability is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This means that it is possible to determine who performed what action, when, and where, providing a record for auditing, incident response, and non-repudiation."
What is Non-repudiation in security?,"Non-repudiation in security refers to the property of providing unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. This prevents an entity from successfully denying having performed a particular action, such as sending a message or executing a transaction."
Explain the security property of Authenticity.,"Authenticity is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity. This means verifying the identity of a user, system, or piece of information to confirm it is genuine and not an imposter or a tampered version."
Define Anonymity or Privacy as a security property.,"Anonymity or privacy, as a security property, refers to the ability to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. This ensures that individuals' identities and sensitive personal data are protected from unauthorized disclosure or linkage to their activities."
What does 'Verifiability' mean as a security property?,"Verifiability, as a security property, means that the system's operations can be independently verified. This implies that there are mechanisms or processes in place to confirm that the system is functioning correctly and securely, and that its outputs and actions are consistent with its design and policies."
Explain the security property of Freshness.,"Freshness is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed. This is crucial for preventing replay attacks, where old, legitimate messages are retransmitted by an attacker to achieve an unauthorized effect."
Define the security property of Fault tolerance.,"Fault tolerance is a security property that describes a system's ability to continue to function correctly despite failures. This means that even if certain components or processes within the system encounter issues, the overall system can maintain its operational integrity and continue to provide its services without complete disruption."
Describe the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in the context of the Target attack case study.,"In the context of the Target attack case study, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) included the Target computer system, encompassing its operating system (OS) and hardware, which were initially considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware, was not trusted. This malware was responsible for leaking sensitive credit card data to the attacker, indicating a compromise within the assumed trusted environment."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge involved the attacker's ability to launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was designed to collect credit card data stored in the database. The attacker leveraged this capability to exfiltrate sensitive financial information."
Which security property was primarily considered in the Target attack threat model?,"The security property primarily considered in the Target attack threat model was Confidentiality. The focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically credit card data, to unauthorized parties."
"What type of malware was used in the Target attack, and what was its primary function?","The malware used in the Target attack was identified as 'Trojan.POSRAM,' which is a type of RAM scraper. Its primary function was to collect unencrypted payment card information immediately after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory."
Describe the data exfiltration process observed in the Target credit card data breach.,"In the Target credit card data breach, the data exfiltration process involved several stages. Over two weeks, the malware collected 11GB of data from Target's POS terminals. This data was initially moved quietly to another server within Target's internal network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, and finally, it was sent to a server in Russia."
"How long did the Target malware operate undetected, and how much data did it collect?","The Target malware operated undetected for more than two weeks. During this period, it collected a significant volume of data, specifically 11GB of credit card information from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals."
How does 'Trojan.POSRAM' compare to 'BlackPOS' according to the analysis?,"According to the analysis, 'Trojan.POSRAM' bears a strong resemblance to 'BlackPOS,' which is another type of POS malware. However, the Target malware, 'Trojan.POSRAM,' contains a new attack method that specifically evades forensic detection and conceals data transfers, making it harder to detect compared to 'BlackPOS'."
Define the security strategy of 'Prevention'.,The security strategy of 'Prevention' involves taking measures that are designed to stop your system from being damaged in the first place. These measures are proactive steps implemented to avert security incidents and protect assets before any harm occurs.
Explain the security strategy of 'Detection'.,"The security strategy of 'Detection' involves taking measures that enable you to identify when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. These measures are reactive, focusing on identifying security incidents as they happen or after they have occurred, providing visibility into breaches and their characteristics."
Describe the security strategy of 'Reaction'.,"The security strategy of 'Reaction' involves taking measures to recover your system from damage or to recover from damage to your system. This strategy also includes the crucial principle of always assuming that bad things will happen and, therefore, preparing your systems for the worst-case outcome. Reaction measures are focused on incident response, recovery, and business continuity."
Why is it important to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome as part of security strategies?,"It is important to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome as part of security strategies because it acknowledges the reality that security incidents can and often will occur despite prevention and detection efforts. By assuming that bad things will happen, organizations can proactively design and implement robust reaction measures, ensuring they can recover their systems from damage and maintain business continuity even in severe breach scenarios."
Explain the 'Least of Privilege' design principle and its core guidelines.,"The 'Least of Privilege' design principle dictates that privileges should be assigned carefully within a system. Its core guidelines are:\n\n*   **Minimal Permissions:** Each entity, whether a user, process, or program, should be given only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task, and no more.\n*   **Just-in-Time Privilege:** Privileges should be granted only when they are needed for a specific operation and should be revoked immediately after their use is complete.\n*   **Harm Reduction:** A program with fewer privileges can cause less harm if it goes awry or becomes subverted by an attacker.\n*   **Preventing Abuse:** Granting unnecessary permissions creates a vulnerability, as a malicious entity could abuse those excess permissions to perform an attack that would otherwise be impossible."
What is the primary benefit of implementing the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"The primary benefit of implementing the 'Least of Privilege' principle is that the less privilege a program or entity has, the less harm it can do if it goes awry or becomes subverted. By limiting permissions to only what is strictly necessary, the potential impact of a security breach or a malfunctioning component is significantly reduced."
What is the risk associated with granting unnecessary permissions according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, the risk associated with granting unnecessary permissions is that a malicious entity could abuse those excess permissions to perform an attack. If a program or user has more privileges than required for its legitimate tasks, an attacker who compromises that entity can leverage those elevated permissions to cause greater damage or gain unauthorized access to other parts of the system."
Provide an example of applying the 'Least of Privilege' principle concerning administrative accounts.,"An example of applying the 'Least of Privilege' principle concerning administrative accounts is to never perform personal activities using a root or administrator (admin) account in an operating system (OS). These accounts possess extensive privileges, and using them for routine, non-administrative tasks unnecessarily exposes the system to higher risk if the account is compromised or if a malicious action is inadvertently performed."
Illustrate the 'Least of Privilege' principle with an example of a smartphone application.,"An illustration of the 'Least of Privilege' principle using a smartphone application is a photo editing application. This application should only be allowed access to the gallery, which is necessary for its core function of editing photos. It should not be granted access to unrelated functionalities like the microphone or location services, as these permissions are not required for photo editing and could be abused if the application were compromised."
Explain the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle and its purpose.,"The 'Separation of Privilege' design principle involves splitting responsibility within a system. Its purpose is to ensure that to perform a privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision. This approach minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by preventing any single entity from having full control over critical processes."
What is the main benefit of implementing the 'Separation of Privilege' principle?,"The main benefit of implementing the 'Separation of Privilege' principle is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise. By requiring multiple parties to collaborate for privileged actions, it ensures that no single entity has full control over critical processes, thereby reducing the likelihood of a single point of failure or malicious intent leading to a security breach."
Provide an example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle in a financial system.,"In a financial system, an example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle is when transferring large sums of money. This action requires approval from multiple parties: an employee, who acts as the initiator, and an additional approval from a manager, who acts as the reviewer. This ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a high-value transaction, thereby minimizing the risk of fraud or error."
Illustrate the 'Separation of Privilege' principle with an example from software development and deployment.,"An illustration of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle in software development and deployment is a scenario where a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, the deployment process is handled by a separate operations team. This separation ensures that the individual who creates the code does not also have the sole authority to release it into the live environment, reducing the risk of malicious code introduction or accidental errors impacting production systems."
What is the fundamental difference between the 'Least of Privilege' and 'Separation of Privilege' design principles?,"The fundamental difference between the 'Least of Privilege' and 'Separation of Privilege' design principles lies in their focus. 'Least of Privilege' focuses on limiting the *amount* of privilege granted to any single entity, ensuring it only has the minimal permissions required for its task. 'Separation of Privilege,' on the other hand, focuses on distributing *control* over privileged actions among multiple entities, requiring collaboration to perform critical operations. While Least Privilege limits what one entity can do, Separation of Privilege limits what one entity can do *alone*."
What is the fundamental role of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in system security?,"The fundamental role of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in system security is to act as the core set of components (hardware, firmware, software) that are critical for enforcing the system's security policy. It is the part of the system that must be trusted to operate correctly and securely, as any compromise within the TCB would undermine the security of the entire system. Its design principles, such as being unbypassable, tamper-resistant, and verifiable, ensure its reliability in maintaining security."
How does an attacker's knowledge influence their approach to system exploitation?,"An attacker's knowledge significantly influences their approach to system exploitation. If an attacker knows the system's design, architecture, or source code, they can directly identify and target specific vulnerabilities, leading to more precise and efficient attacks. Conversely, if an attacker lacks detailed knowledge, they must rely on probing or trial and error. This approach involves systematically testing different inputs, configurations, or interactions to discover weaknesses, which can be a more time-consuming and less direct method of exploitation."
