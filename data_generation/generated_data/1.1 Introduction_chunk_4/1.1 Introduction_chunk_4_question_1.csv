What are the fundamental design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The fundamental design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable.\n\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible method to breach system security by circumventing the TCB.\n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** This means the TCB must be protected against interference from other parts of the system that exist outside of the TCB. These external components are prevented from modifying the TCB's code or its operational state.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** This principle requires that it should be possible to independently verify the correctness and proper functioning of the TCB."
Explain the concept of 'Unbypassable' as a TCB design principle.,"The 'Unbypassable' principle, also referred to as completeness, is a core design tenet for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB). It mandates that there must be absolutely no way for an attacker or any unauthorized entity to breach the system's security by circumventing or bypassing the TCB. The TCB must be the sole and unavoidable path for all security-critical operations, ensuring its control cannot be sidestepped."
What does 'Tamper-resistant' mean in the context of TCB design?,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, 'Tamper-resistant,' also known as security, means that the TCB must be protected against any other parts of the system that reside outside of the TCB itself. These external components are explicitly prevented from modifying the TCB's code or its internal state. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the TCB's security functions."
"Why is the size of a TCB important, and what principle does it relate to?","The size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is crucial because a smaller TCB is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions, which reduces the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This concept aligns with the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle**, which advocates for simplicity in design to enhance reliability and maintainability. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging, as it necessitates considering a greater number of potential malicious entities."
What is the KISS principle and how does it apply to TCB design?,"The **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle** is a design philosophy that suggests that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, this principle applies because a system with a smaller TCB is inherently more trustworthy and easier to verify. A smaller TCB means fewer components and interactions to scrutinize, reducing the number of assumptions that need to be made, which in turn lowers the risk of those assumptions being incorrect or violated."
What are the two main types of attackers based on their interaction with a system?,"Based on their interaction with a system, the two main types of attackers are **Active attackers** and **Passive attackers**.\n\n*   An **Active attacker** is one who manipulates or disrupts the systems. Examples of their actions include modifying data or injecting malicious code into the system.\n*   A **Passive attacker** is one who focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operations. Their goal is to collect data without being detected or altering the system's state."
Define an 'Active attacker' and provide examples of their actions.,An **Active attacker** is a type of adversary who actively manipulates or disrupts systems. Their actions are characterized by direct interference with the system's operations or data. Examples of an active attacker's actions include modifying data within the system or injecting malicious code to alter its behavior or compromise its security.
What is a 'Passive attacker' and how do they operate?,"A **Passive attacker** is a type of adversary whose primary objective is observing and gathering information from a system without interfering with its operations. Unlike active attackers, passive attackers do not modify data, inject code, or disrupt services. Their activities are typically covert, focusing on collecting sensitive information or understanding system behavior without leaving a trace of their presence or altering the system's state."
What are the different levels of knowledge an attacker might possess about a system?,"An attacker's knowledge about a system can vary significantly, impacting their attack strategies. The different levels of knowledge an attacker might possess include:\n\n*   **Detailed knowledge:** The attacker may know the system's design, architecture, source code, and other intricate details.\n*   **Limited knowledge:** The attacker may lack detailed knowledge and, in such cases, must rely on probing the system or using trial and error methods to discover vulnerabilities or gain information."
What factors define an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's capability is defined by several key factors that determine their potential effectiveness and the scope of their attacks. These factors include:\n\n*   **Computing resources:** How much computing power and infrastructure the attacker can leverage.\n*   **System interaction points:** What specific parts of the system the attacker can interact with, indicating their access and control.\n*   **Time constraints:** Whether the attacker has unlimited time to execute their attack or if they need to act quickly, which can influence the complexity and stealth of their methods."
What are the security goals that systems aim to achieve?,"The security goals that systems aim to achieve are commonly categorized under the **CIA model**, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These are the primary objectives for securing a system.\n\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information.\n*   **Integrity (I):** Preventing unauthorized modification of information.\n*   **Availability (A):** Preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources."
Explain Confidentiality as a security property.,"**Confidentiality (C)** is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. Its goal is to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. This means that only authorized individuals or systems should be able to access or view specific data. Examples of threats to confidentiality include eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying of data."
What is Integrity in the context of security properties?,"**Integrity (I)** is a security property focused on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. The goal is to maintain the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. Threats to integrity include intercepting packets, modifying them, and then releasing them."
Describe Availability as a security property.,"**Availability (A)** is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources, such as data, services, or system access, are always available to authorized users when needed. The objective is to guarantee reliable and timely access to legitimate users. A common threat to availability is the disruption of services, often through denial-of-service attacks."
What are the common threats to Confidentiality?,The common threats to **Confidentiality** are actions that lead to the unauthorized disclosure of information. These include:\n\n*   **Eavesdropping:** Covertly listening to private communications.\n*   **Packet sniffing:** Intercepting and analyzing data packets traveling over a network.\n*   **Illegal copying:** Unauthorized duplication of sensitive data or files.
What are the common threats to Integrity?,"The common threats to **Integrity** are actions that lead to the unauthorized modification of information. These primarily involve:\n\n*   **Intercepting packets:** Capturing data packets as they are transmitted.\n*   **Modify and release:** Altering the intercepted data packets before sending them on to their intended destination, thereby corrupting the information or changing system behavior."
What is the primary threat to Availability?,"The primary threat to **Availability** is the **disruption of services**. This refers to any action or event that prevents authorized users from accessing information or resources when they need them. Such disruptions can render systems, data, or services inaccessible, thereby violating the availability principle."
"Beyond the CIA model, what is Accountability in security properties?","Beyond the CIA model, **Accountability** is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This means that there should be mechanisms in place to record who performed what action, when, and where, allowing for auditing and forensic analysis. Accountability is crucial for deterring malicious behavior and for post-incident investigations."
Define Non-repudiation as a security property.,"**Non-repudiation** is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. It ensures that an entity cannot legitimately deny having performed a particular action or having sent a specific message. This property is critical for establishing trust and for legal enforceability, as it prevents participants in a communication or transaction from falsely disclaiming their involvement."
What does Authenticity mean in security properties?,"**Authenticity** is a security property that aims to ensure that the communicated entity is indeed the correct and legitimate entity it claims to be. This applies to users, systems, and data. It verifies the identity of a user or the origin of data, preventing impersonation or spoofing. For example, it ensures that a message truly came from the sender it purports to be from."
Explain Anonymity or privacy as a security property.,**Anonymity or privacy** is a security property focused on hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. Its goal is to protect an individual's sensitive data and ensure that their actions or identity cannot be linked back to them without their consent. This property is crucial for safeguarding personal data and maintaining user trust.
What is Verifiability in the context of security properties?,"**Verifiability** is a security property that states the system's operations can be independently verified. This means that there should be a way to confirm that the system is functioning correctly and securely, and that its processes are producing accurate and expected results. Independent verification adds a layer of trust and assurance to the system's integrity and correctness."
Describe Freshness as a security property.,"**Freshness** is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. This property is vital in preventing replay attacks, where old, legitimate messages are retransmitted by an attacker to achieve an unauthorized effect. Freshness guarantees that each message or data instance is unique and timely, reflecting the most recent state or intent."
What is Fault tolerance in security properties?,"**Fault tolerance** is a security property that enables a system to continue functioning correctly despite failures. This means that even if certain components or processes within the system encounter errors or cease to operate, the overall system can still maintain its essential services and integrity. It's about designing systems to be resilient and robust against unexpected issues, ensuring continuous operation and availability."
What was the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) assumption in the Target attack case study?,"In the Target attack case study, the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** assumption was that the Target computer system, including its operating system (OS) and hardware, was trusted. However, the malicious software that was introduced into the system was explicitly *not* trusted. This malicious software was responsible for leaking data to the attacker, indicating a breach within the assumed trusted environment due to untrusted software."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge involved the attacker's ability to launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was then used to collect credit card data stored in the database. This implies the attacker had the capability to infiltrate the POS network and deploy sophisticated malicious software, along with the knowledge to target and extract sensitive financial information."
Which security property was primarily considered in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the security property primarily considered was **Confidentiality**. The focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically credit card data. The breach demonstrated a failure in maintaining confidentiality, as unauthorized disclosure of customer financial data occurred."
What type of malware was identified in the Target credit card breach?,"The type of malware identified in the Target credit card breach was **""Trojan.POSRAM,""** which is known as a **RAM scraper**. This malware collected unencrypted payment card information immediately after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory. The code of ""Trojan.POSRAM"" bore a strong resemblance to ""BlackPOS,"" another type of POS malware, but included a new attack method to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers."
How did the Target malware evade detection?,"The Target malware, identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" contained a new attack method that allowed it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. This made it particularly hard to detect, contributing to its ability to remain undetected for more than two weeks while collecting sensitive credit card information."
Where was the stolen Target credit card data initially moved before being sent to Russia?,"The stolen Target credit card data was initially moved to another server on Target's internal network. After this internal transfer, it was then transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, before ultimately being sent to a server in Russia."
What are the three main security strategies?,"The three main security strategies are **Prevention**, **Detection**, and **Reaction**.\n\n*   **Prevention:** Involves taking measures that prevent your system from being damaged in the first place.\n*   **Detection:** Focuses on implementing measures that allow you to detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged.\n*   **Reaction:** Consists of taking measures to recover your system from damage, or to recover from a damage to your system. It also includes preparing for worst-case outcomes by assuming bad things will happen."
Define the 'Prevention' security strategy.,"The **Prevention** security strategy involves taking proactive measures designed to stop your system from being damaged. This strategy focuses on implementing safeguards and controls to avert security incidents before they occur, thereby minimizing the risk of harm to the system's assets, data, and operations."
What is the purpose of the 'Detection' security strategy?,"The purpose of the **Detection** security strategy is to implement measures that enable you to identify when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. This strategy focuses on monitoring, logging, and alerting mechanisms that can reveal security breaches, unauthorized activities, or system compromises after they have occurred, but ideally before significant harm is done."
Explain the 'Reaction' security strategy.,"The **Reaction** security strategy involves taking measures to recover your system from damage or to recover from a damage to your system. A key aspect of this strategy is to always assume that bad things will happen and, therefore, to prepare your systems for the worst-case outcome. This includes having incident response plans, backup and recovery procedures, and contingency plans to restore operations and minimize the impact of a security incident."
What is the core principle of 'Least of Privilege' in system design?,"The core principle of **'Least of Privilege'** in system design is to assign privileges carefully by giving each entity (such as a user, program, or process) only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its specific task. This principle aims to limit the potential harm that can be caused if an entity is compromised or malfunctions, as it will only have access to the resources absolutely required for its function."
How should privileges be assigned according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, privileges should be assigned carefully by:\n\n*   Giving each entity only the minimal permissions required to complete its specific task.\n*   Granting the necessary privilege only when it is needed and revoking that privilege after its use.\n*   Understanding that the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can do if it goes awry or becomes subverted.\n*   Recognizing that granting unnecessary permissions creates an opportunity for a malicious entity to abuse those permissions to perform an attack."
Provide an example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for an operating system user.,"An example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for an operating system user is the recommendation to **never perform personal activities using a root or administrator account in an OS**. A root or admin account possesses extensive privileges that are far beyond what is needed for routine tasks. By using a less privileged standard user account for daily activities, the potential impact of a security breach (e.g., malware infection) is significantly reduced, as the malware would only inherit the limited permissions of the standard user, rather than full system control."
Provide an example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for a mobile application.,"An example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for a mobile application is a photo editing application on a smartphone. This application should **only be allowed access to the gallery** (where photos are stored) but should **not be granted access to the microphone or location services**. Access to the microphone or location is unnecessary for its core function of editing photos, and granting such permissions would create an unnecessary security risk that could be exploited by a malicious entity."
Why is it important to revoke privileges after use under the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"It is important to revoke privileges after use under the 'Least of Privilege' principle because it minimizes the window of opportunity for those privileges to be exploited. By granting privileges only when they are actively needed for a specific task and then immediately revoking them, the system reduces the attack surface. If a program or user is compromised, the attacker will only have access to the minimal set of permissions for a limited duration, thereby reducing the potential harm they can inflict."
What is the primary goal of the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle?,"The primary goal of the **'Separation of Privilege'** design principle is to split responsibility for privileged actions. This means that to perform a critical or privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision. This approach minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes."
How does 'Separation of Privilege' minimize risk?,"'Separation of Privilege' minimizes risk by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. By requiring multiple parties to collaborate to perform a privileged action, it prevents a single point of failure or compromise. This design makes it significantly harder for a malicious actor to gain complete control, as they would need to compromise multiple independent entities. It also reduces the likelihood of errors or misuse by distributing responsibility and requiring independent verification or approval."
Provide a financial system example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle.,"In a financial system, an example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle is when transferring large sums of money. This action typically requires approval from an employee who initiates the transfer (the **initiator**), and then an additional, separate approval from a manager (the **reviewer**). This ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a significant financial transaction, thereby minimizing the risk of fraud, error, or unauthorized transfers."
Provide a software development example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle.,"In software development, an example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle is when a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, the deployment process is handled by a separate operations team. This separation ensures that the individual who writes the code does not also have the sole authority to release it into the live environment, reducing the risk of malicious code injection, accidental errors, or unauthorized changes affecting the production system."
What is the difference between 'Least of Privilege' and 'Separation of Privilege'?,"While both 'Least of Privilege' and 'Separation of Privilege' are security design principles, they address different aspects of privilege management.\n\n*   **Least of Privilege** focuses on *limiting the permissions granted to any single entity* (user, program) to the absolute minimum required for its task. It's about reducing the scope of what an entity can do.\n*   **Separation of Privilege** focuses on *distributing the authority for critical actions across multiple entities*, requiring collaboration to complete a privileged task. It's about ensuring no single entity has unilateral control over sensitive operations."
What does 'Verifiable (or correctness)' imply for TCB design?,"'Verifiable (or correctness)' as a TCB design principle implies that it should be possible to independently verify the correctness of the Trusted Computing Base. This means that the TCB's design, implementation, and operation should be amenable to rigorous analysis and testing to confirm that it functions exactly as intended and meets its security requirements without flaws or vulnerabilities. This independent verification adds a layer of assurance to the TCB's trustworthiness."
How does a smaller TCB impact trustworthiness and verification efforts?,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) positively impacts trustworthiness and verification efforts because it is inherently more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is due to the reduced complexity; with fewer components and lines of code, there are fewer assumptions that need to be made about its behavior. Fewer assumptions mean a lower chance of those assumptions being violated, making the TCB's security properties more robust and its correctness simpler to ascertain through analysis and testing."
What is the primary concern when designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"The primary concern when designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that it can be more challenging. This increased challenge stems from the need to consider more malicious entities. While a smaller TCB is easier to verify, the design process must be extremely thorough to ensure that its limited scope still adequately protects against a wider array of potential threats and attack vectors, given its critical role in system security."
What kind of information does a passive attacker typically gather?,"A passive attacker typically gathers information by observing system activities without interfering. This can include collecting data such as network traffic, communication patterns, or system configurations. Their goal is to gain insights into the system's operation, identify sensitive data, or understand user behavior, all without altering the system's state or leaving detectable traces of their presence."
Why might an attacker lack detailed knowledge of a system?,"An attacker might lack detailed knowledge of a system if they do not have access to its design specifications, architecture diagrams, or source code. In such scenarios, they must rely on less direct methods to understand the system. This typically involves **probing** the system, which means sending various inputs and observing the outputs, or using **trial and error** to discover vulnerabilities, functionalities, or configurations without a comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure."
How do security properties relate to the security goals of a system?,"Security properties are essentially the specific attributes or characteristics that a system must possess to achieve its overall security goals. For instance, **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** are common security properties (part of the CIA model) that directly correspond to the security goals of preventing unauthorized disclosure, modification, and withholding of information or resources, respectively. Other properties like Accountability, Non-repudiation, and Authenticity further define specific aspects of security that contribute to a robust and trustworthy system."
What is the significance of 'unforgeable evidence' in Non-repudiation?,"The significance of 'unforgeable evidence' in **Non-repudiation** is that it provides irrefutable proof that a specific action occurred or that a particular message was sent or received by an entity. This evidence cannot be legitimately denied by the entity involved. It's crucial for establishing trust, accountability, and legal validity in digital transactions and communications, as it prevents parties from falsely disclaiming their involvement or actions."
How does 'Freshness' protect against replay attacks?,"**Freshness** protects against replay attacks by ensuring that data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. In a replay attack, an attacker captures a legitimate message and retransmits it later to trick the system into performing an unauthorized action. By requiring freshness, the system can detect and reject messages that are old or have been seen before, thereby preventing the attacker from successfully replaying them and achieving their malicious goals."
What was the role of 'RAM scraper' malware in the Target attack?,"In the Target attack, the 'RAM scraper' malware, specifically ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" played a critical role by collecting unencrypted payment card information. This malware operated by scraping data directly from the memory (RAM) of Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. It was designed to capture credit card details immediately after they were swiped and while they temporarily resided in the terminal's memory, before encryption or further processing could occur, thus allowing the attackers to steal sensitive financial data."
Why is it important to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome as part of security strategies?,"It is important to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome as part of security strategies because it acknowledges the reality that security breaches and system failures can and often will occur, despite prevention and detection efforts. This proactive approach, part of the **Reaction** strategy, ensures that even when bad things happen, the organization has established measures to recover, minimize damage, and restore operations efficiently. It builds resilience and reduces the overall impact of security incidents."
How does the 'Least of Privilege' principle contribute to overall system security?,"The 'Least of Privilege' principle contributes significantly to overall system security by reducing the potential attack surface and limiting the damage that can be caused by a compromised entity. By ensuring that users, programs, and processes only have the minimal permissions necessary for their tasks, it restricts an attacker's ability to move laterally, escalate privileges, or cause widespread harm if they manage to compromise a part of the system. This containment strategy makes the system more resilient to various types of attacks."
What is the risk of granting unnecessary permissions according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, the risk of granting unnecessary permissions is that a malicious entity could abuse those permissions to perform an attack. If a program or user is granted more privileges than it needs, and that entity is compromised, an attacker can leverage those excessive permissions to carry out actions beyond the intended scope, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying critical system files, or escalating their control over the system. This creates an avoidable vulnerability."
How does 'Separation of Privilege' enhance security in critical processes?,"'Separation of Privilege' enhances security in critical processes by ensuring that no single entity has full, unilateral control over them. By requiring multiple independent parties to cooperate to complete a sensitive action, it introduces checks and balances. This design makes it significantly more difficult for a single malicious actor or an accidental error by one individual to compromise a critical process, as it would necessitate the compromise or collusion of multiple entities, thereby greatly reducing the risk of misuse, error, or compromise."
What are the implications of an attacker having unlimited time versus needing to act quickly?,"The implications of an attacker having unlimited time versus needing to act quickly significantly impact their strategy and the complexity of their attacks. If an attacker has **unlimited time**, they can afford to be more patient, conduct extensive reconnaissance, use slower but stealthier methods, and perform more thorough probing and trial-and-error to find vulnerabilities. Conversely, if an attacker **needs to act quickly**, they are likely to use more direct, potentially noisier, or less sophisticated methods that prioritize speed over stealth, possibly relying on known exploits or readily available tools."
What is the primary goal of security properties?,"The primary goal of security properties is to define the specific attributes and characteristics that a system must exhibit to achieve its overall security objectives. These properties, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA model), serve as benchmarks to ensure that the system effectively protects information and resources against various threats, thereby establishing a secure and trustworthy operating environment."
How does 'Accountability' support security investigations?,"**Accountability** supports security investigations by ensuring that the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This means that when a security incident occurs, investigators can use logs, audit trails, and other evidence to determine who performed what actions, when, and from where. This ability to attribute actions to specific entities is crucial for understanding the scope of a breach, identifying perpetrators, and implementing corrective measures, making it a cornerstone of forensic analysis and incident response."
What is the relationship between 'Verifiability' as a TCB design principle and 'Verifiability' as a general security property?,"The relationship between 'Verifiability' as a TCB design principle and 'Verifiability' as a general security property is one of specific application within a broader concept. \n\n*   As a **TCB design principle**, 'Verifiability (or correctness)' specifically states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the *Trusted Computing Base* itself. This focuses on the core security component.\n*   As a **general security property**, 'Verifiability' broadly refers to the ability for *the system's operations* to be independently verified. This encompasses all aspects of the system, not just the TCB, ensuring that its functions and outcomes can be confirmed as correct and legitimate."
What are the implications of an attacker's computing resources on their capabilities?,"The implications of an attacker's computing resources on their capabilities are significant. Greater computing resources allow an attacker to perform more complex and resource-intensive attacks, such as brute-force password cracking, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or sophisticated cryptographic attacks. Conversely, limited computing resources would restrict an attacker to simpler, less effective methods, or require them to compromise more systems to achieve their goals, thereby influencing the scale and sophistication of their potential threats."
Why is it challenging to design a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is challenging because it requires considering more malicious entities. While a smaller TCB is easier to verify, its reduced size means that the security mechanisms within it must be exceptionally robust and comprehensive to protect against a wider range of potential threats. The design must account for various attack vectors and ensure that the minimal set of trusted components can effectively withstand sophisticated attacks from numerous potential adversaries, making the design process more intricate and demanding."
"How does the 'KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle' relate to system trustworthiness?","The 'KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle' relates to system trustworthiness by advocating for simplicity, which inherently makes a system more trustworthy. A simpler system, particularly one with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB), is easier to understand, analyze, and verify. This reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made about its behavior and components, thereby decreasing the likelihood of hidden flaws, vulnerabilities, or unexpected interactions that could compromise its trustworthiness. Simplicity leads to greater transparency and confidence in the system's security."
