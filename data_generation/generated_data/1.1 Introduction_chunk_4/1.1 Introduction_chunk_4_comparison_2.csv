Compare an active attacker with a passive attacker.,"An **active attacker** manipulates or disrupts systems, which can involve actions such as modifying data or injecting code. In contrast, a **passive attacker** focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system."
What are the differences between Confidentiality and Integrity in security properties?,"**Confidentiality (C)** is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. **Integrity (I)**, on the other hand, is a security property focused on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties."
Compare Confidentiality with Availability as common security properties.,"**Confidentiality (C)** is a security property that prevents the unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning sensitive data should not be leaked to unauthorized parties. **Availability (A)**, in contrast, prevents the unauthorized withholding of information or resources, ensuring that resources are always available for authorized users."
What are the distinctions between Integrity and Availability in the context of security properties?,"**Integrity (I)** is a security property that prevents the unauthorized modification of information, ensuring that critical system state and code remain unaltered by malicious parties. **Availability (A)**, conversely, is a security property that prevents the unauthorized withholding of information or resources, guaranteeing that resources are consistently accessible to authorized users."
"Compare the ""Unbypassable"" and ""Tamper-resistant"" design principles for a TCB.","The **Unbypassable (completeness)** design principle for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB itself. The **Tamper-resistant (security)** principle, however, states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB, meaning these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state."
"What are the differences between an ""Unbypassable"" and a ""Verifiable"" TCB design principle?","The **Unbypassable (completeness)** design principle for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) means there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. In contrast, the **Verifiable (or correctness)** principle means it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB."
"Compare the ""Tamper-resistant"" and ""Verifiable"" design principles for a TCB.","The **Tamper-resistant (security)** design principle for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) requires that the TCB be protected against other parts outside of it, preventing these external parts from modifying the TCB's code or state. The **Verifiable (or correctness)** principle, on the other hand, focuses on the ability to verify the correctness of the TCB."
Compare the advantages and challenges associated with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"A system with a smaller **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces the need for making too many assumptions, which might otherwise be violated. This aligns with the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle**. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging because it necessitates considering more malicious entities."
Compare an attacker who knows the system's design with one who lacks detailed knowledge.,"An attacker who **knows the system's design, architecture, source code, etc.** possesses detailed knowledge that can be leveraged for attacks. Conversely, an attacker who **lacks detailed knowledge** must rely on probing or trial and error to understand and exploit the system."
What are the differences between Prevention and Detection as security strategies?,"**Prevention** as a security strategy involves taking measures that prevent your system from being damaged in the first place. **Detection**, on the other hand, involves taking measures so that you can detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged after an incident has occurred."
Compare the security strategies of Prevention and Reaction.,"**Prevention** is a security strategy focused on taking measures to stop your system from being damaged. **Reaction**, conversely, involves taking measures to recover your system from damage or to recover from damage to your system. It also includes the principle of always assuming bad things will happen and preparing systems for the worst-case outcome."
What are the differences between Detection and Reaction in security strategies?,"**Detection** as a security strategy involves taking measures to identify when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. **Reaction**, in contrast, involves taking measures to recover your system from damage. It also encompasses the proactive approach of assuming that adverse events will occur and preparing systems for the worst-case scenario."
Compare the design principles of Least of Privilege and Separation of Privilege.,"The **Design Principle: Least of Privilege** dictates assigning each entity the minimal permissions required to complete its task, giving privilege only when needed and revoking it after use. This minimizes harm if a program goes awry or is subverted. The **Design Principle: Separation of Privilege**, however, focuses on splitting responsibility, requiring multiple parties to work together to exercise a privileged action rather than a single point of control. This minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring no single entity has full control over critical processes."
What are the differences between Accountability and Non-repudiation as security properties?,"**Accountability** is a security property where the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. **Non-repudiation**, on the other hand, provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred, preventing an entity from falsely denying having performed an action."
Compare Accountability with Authenticity as security properties.,"**Accountability** is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. **Authenticity**, in contrast, is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity, verifying its genuineness."

What are the distinctions between Freshness and Fault tolerance as security properties?,"**Freshness** is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed. **Fault tolerance**, conversely, is a security property that enables the system to continue functioning correctly even in the presence of failures."
Compare Trojan.POSRAM with BlackPOS based on the Target attack case study.,"**Trojan.POSRAM** and **BlackPOS** are both types of POS malware. While they are similar, the Target malware, Trojan.POSRAM, contains a new attack method that evades forensic detection and conceals data transfers, making it harder to detect compared to BlackPOS, which was being used by cyberattackers as far back as March 2013."
"In the context of the Target attack threat model, compare the Trusted Computing Base with malicious software.","In the Target attack threat model, the **Trusted Computing Base** refers to the Target computer system, including its operating system (OS) and hardware, which are considered trusted components. In contrast, the **malicious software** launched by the attacker is explicitly *not* trusted, and it is this software that leaks data to the attacker."
Compare eavesdropping with intercepting packets as attack methods.,"**Eavesdropping** is an attack method that involves secretly listening to private communications, often associated with packet sniffing and illegal copying. **Intercepting packets**, while also involving capturing data, specifically refers to the act of seizing data packets in transit, which can then be followed by modification and release."

Compare Integrity (from the CIA model) with Non-repudiation (from other security properties).,"**Integrity (I)**, a common security property, prevents the unauthorized modification of information, ensuring that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. **Non-repudiation**, another security property, provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred, preventing an entity from falsely denying having performed an action. While both relate to the trustworthiness of actions or data, Integrity focuses on preventing alteration, and Non-repudiation focuses on proving an action's occurrence."
"Compare the concept of ""Verifiability"" as a TCB design principle with ""Verifiability"" as an other security property.","As a **TCB design principle (or correctness)**, **Verifiability** means it should be possible to verify the correctness of the Trusted Computing Base. As an **other security property**, **Verifiability** means the system's operations can be independently verified. Both contexts refer to the ability to confirm correctness or operations, but one applies specifically to the TCB itself, and the other to the broader system's operations."
"Compare the benefits of a smaller TCB, as it relates to the KISS principle, with the challenges of designing such a system.","A system with a smaller **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made, which aligns with the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle**. However, despite these benefits, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging because it requires considering a greater number of malicious entities."
Compare the security goals of preventing unauthorized disclosure and preventing unauthorized modification.,"The security goal of **preventing unauthorized disclosure of information** is known as **Confidentiality (C)**, which ensures sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. The security goal of **preventing unauthorized modification of information** is known as **Integrity (I)**, which ensures critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties."
What are the differences between preventing unauthorized modification and preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources?,"**Preventing unauthorized modification of information** is the goal of **Integrity (I)**, a security property that ensures critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. **Preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources** is the goal of **Availability (A)**, a security property that ensures resources are always available for authorized users."
Compare the security goals of preventing unauthorized disclosure and preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources.,"**Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information** is the goal of **Confidentiality (C)**, ensuring sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. **Preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources** is the goal of **Availability (A)**, ensuring that resources are always available for authorized users."
Compare the security properties where actions can be traced versus where unforgeable evidence of actions exists.,"The security property where **actions of an entity can be traced and identified** is called **Accountability**. The security property where there is **unforgeable evidence that specific actions occur** is called **Non-repudiation**. While both relate to actions, Accountability focuses on identifying the actor, and Non-repudiation focuses on proving the action itself."
What are the differences between ensuring the communicated entity is correct and hiding personal information and identity?,"**Ensuring the communicated entity is the correct entity** is the definition of the security property **Authenticity**. **Hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties** is the definition of the security property **Anonymity or privacy**. Authenticity verifies the genuineness of an entity, while Anonymity or privacy protects an entity's identity from disclosure."
Compare the security properties of system operations being independently verified and data or communications being current.,"The security property where **the system's operations can be independently verified** is called **Verifiability**. The security property where **the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed** is called **Freshness**. Verifiability focuses on the correctness of operations, while Freshness focuses on the timeliness and uniqueness of data."
What are the distinctions between a system continuing to function despite failures and data or communications being current?,"The security property where **the system can continue to function correctly despite failures** is called **Fault tolerance**. The security property where **the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed** is called **Freshness**. Fault tolerance addresses system resilience against failures, whereas Freshness addresses the timeliness and replay-prevention of data."
Compare the core tenets of assigning minimal permissions and requiring multiple parties for privileged actions.,"Assigning **minimal permissions to complete a task** is a core tenet of the **Design Principle: Least of Privilege**. Requiring **multiple parties to work together to exercise a privileged action** is a core tenet of the **Design Principle: Separation of Privilege**. Least Privilege limits an entity's power, while Separation of Privilege distributes control over critical actions."
Compare the practice of revoking privilege after use with the practice of requiring multiple approvals for an action.,"**Revoking the privilege after use** is a practice aligned with the **Design Principle: Least of Privilege**, which aims to give privilege only when needed. **Requiring approval from an employee (initiator) and additional approval from a manager (reviewer)** for transferring large sums of money is an example illustrating the **Design Principle: Separation of Privilege**, which splits responsibility to minimize risk."
Compare the security strategies of preventing system damage and recovering from system damage.,"The security strategy of **Prevention** involves taking measures that prevent your system from being damaged.

The security strategy of **Reaction** involves taking measures so that you can recover your system or recover from damage to your system, and also includes preparing your systems for the worst-case outcome."
Compare modifying data with injecting code as actions of an active attacker.,"Both **modifying data** and **injecting code** are examples of actions an **active attacker** might take to manipulate or disrupt systems. Modifying data involves altering existing information, while injecting code involves introducing new, often malicious, executable instructions into the system."
Compare observing information with gathering information in the context of a passive attacker.,"For a **passive attacker**, **observing information** and **gathering information** are closely related actions performed without interfering with the system. Observing typically refers to the act of monitoring, while gathering implies collecting the observed information for later analysis or use. Both contribute to the passive attacker's goal of acquiring intelligence without detection."
Compare an attacker's knowledge of a system's design with an attacker's knowledge of its source code.,"An attacker who **knows the system's design** has an understanding of its architecture and how its components are structured. An attacker who **knows the source code** has access to the actual implementation details of the system. Both fall under the category of detailed knowledge that an attacker might possess, providing different levels of insight into potential vulnerabilities."
Compare an attacker who has unlimited time with one who needs to act quickly.,"An attacker who has **unlimited time** can patiently probe and exploit a system, potentially conducting more thorough reconnaissance and complex attacks. Conversely, an attacker who **needs to act quickly** might be constrained by factors such as detection risk or fleeting opportunities, leading to more rapid, potentially less sophisticated, attack methods. These are considerations for an attacker's capability."
Compare eavesdropping with packet sniffing as attack methods.,"**Eavesdropping** is a general term for secretly listening to private communications. **Packet sniffing** is a specific form of eavesdropping that involves intercepting and analyzing data packets traveling over a computer network. Both are methods for unauthorized information gathering, often associated with passive attacks."
What are the differences between illegal copying and intercepting packets as attack methods?,"**Illegal copying** refers to the unauthorized duplication of information, often associated with eavesdropping and packet sniffing. **Intercepting packets** is the act of seizing data packets as they travel across a network, which can then be followed by modification and release. Illegal copying focuses on duplicating static or transmitted data, while intercepting packets focuses on capturing data in transit, potentially for further manipulation."
"Compare the attack actions of ""modify and release"" with ""disrupt services.""","The attack action of **""modify and release""** involves intercepting packets, altering their content, and then allowing them to continue to their destination. This is a form of active attack. **""Disrupt services""** is another attack action that aims to make resources unavailable to authorized users, directly impacting the availability security property."
"In the Target attack threat model, compare the trust level of the Target's OS and hardware with that of malicious software.","In the Target attack threat model, the **Target computer system, including its OS and hardware**, constitutes the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** and is considered trusted. In stark contrast, the **malicious software** launched by the attacker is explicitly stated as **not trusted**, and it is this untrusted software that is responsible for leaking data to the attacker."
Compare the characteristic of Target's POS malware collecting unencrypted payment card information with its ability to evade forensic detection.,"**Target's POS malware**, specifically Trojan.POSRAM, was characterized by its ability to **collect unencrypted payment card information** just after it was swiped and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory. Another key characteristic of this malware was its **new attack method that evades forensic detection and conceals data transfers**, making it hard to detect. Both are critical aspects of the malware's functionality and impact."
