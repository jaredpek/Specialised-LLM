Compare and contrast an active attacker with a passive attacker.,"An **active attacker** is an entity that manipulates or disrupts systems, for example, by modifying data or injecting code. In contrast, a **passive attacker** focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system."
What are the key differences between Confidentiality and Integrity as security properties?,"**Confidentiality (C)** is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. **Integrity (I)**, on the other hand, is a security property focused on preventing unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties."
Compare Confidentiality with Availability in the context of security properties.,"**Confidentiality (C)** is a security property that prevents the unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning sensitive data should not be leaked to unauthorized parties. **Availability (A)**, in contrast, is a security property that prevents the unauthorized withholding of information or resources, ensuring that resources are always available for authorized users."
Explain the differences between Integrity and Availability as common security properties.,"**Integrity (I)** is a security property that prevents unauthorized modification of information, ensuring that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. **Availability (A)**, conversely, is a security property that prevents unauthorized withholding of information or resources, guaranteeing that resources are always accessible to authorized users."
"Compare the ""Unbypassable"" and ""Tamper-resistant"" design principles for a TCB.","The **Unbypassable (completeness)** design principle for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. The **Tamper-resistant (security)** principle, however, states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB, meaning these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state."
What distinguishes a Tamper-resistant TCB from a Verifiable TCB?,"A **Tamper-resistant (security)** Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is designed to be protected against other parts outside the TCB, preventing them from modifying the TCB's code or state. A **Verifiable (or correctness)** TCB, on the other hand, is designed such that it is possible to verify its correctness."
Compare the Unbypassable and Verifiable design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The **Unbypassable (completeness)** design principle for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) requires that there is no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB.

Compare an attacker who knows the system's design with one who lacks detailed knowledge.,"An attacker who **knows the system's design, architecture, source code, etc.** possesses detailed knowledge that can be leveraged for attacks. In contrast, an attacker who **lacks detailed knowledge** must rely on probing or trial and error to understand and exploit the system."
What are the differences between Prevention and Detection as security strategies?,"**Prevention** as a security strategy involves taking measures that prevent a system from being damaged. **Detection**, on the other hand, involves taking measures so that one can detect when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged."
Compare the Detection and Reaction security strategies.,"**Detection** as a security strategy involves taking measures to detect when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged. **Reaction**, in contrast, involves taking measures to recover a system or to recover from damage to a system. It also includes preparing systems for the worst-case outcome by assuming bad things will happen."
Explain the differences between Prevention and Reaction security strategies.,"**Prevention** as a security strategy focuses on taking measures that prevent a system from being damaged in the first place. **Reaction**, conversely, involves taking measures to recover a system or to recover from damage to a system, and also includes preparing for worst-case outcomes by assuming bad things will happen."
Compare the design principles of Least of Privilege and Separation of Privilege.,"The **Design Principle: Least of Privilege** dictates assigning each entity the minimal permissions required to complete its task, giving privilege only when needed and revoking it after use. This minimizes harm if a program goes awry or is subverted. The **Design Principle: Separation of Privilege**, however, involves splitting responsibility such that performing a privileged action requires multiple parties to work together, rather than a single point of control. This minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring no single entity has full control over critical processes."

"Compare the concept of ""Verifiability"" as a TCB design principle versus a general security property.","As a **TCB design principle**, **Verifiable (or correctness)** means it should be possible to verify the correctness of the Trusted Computing Base. As a general **security property**, **Verifiability** means the system's operations can be independently verified. While both relate to verification, the TCB principle specifically applies to the correctness of the TCB itself, whereas the general security property applies to the independent verification of overall system operations."

"Discuss the dual nature of a smaller TCB, considering both its benefits and challenges.","A system with a **smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions, which might otherwise be violated. This aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. However, **designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is also more challenging** because it necessitates considering more malicious entities due to the reduced scope of trusted components."

Compare an attacker's knowledge with an attacker's capability.,"An **attacker's knowledge** refers to what the attacker knows about the system, such as its design, architecture, source code, or whether they lack detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error. An **attacker's capability**, on the other hand, refers to the resources and means available to the attacker, including how much computing resources they can leverage, what parts of the system they can interact with, and whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly. Knowledge is about information, while capability is about means and resources."
