Analyse the design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) with respect to its core security requirements.,"The design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are centered around ensuring its robustness and reliability in maintaining system security. These principles include being Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable.\n\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible method to breach system security by circumventing the TCB. It ensures that the TCB is a complete and inescapable security perimeter.\n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** The TCB must be protected against interference from other parts of the system that lie outside its boundary. These external components are explicitly prevented from modifying the TCB's code or its operational state, thereby preserving its integrity.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** It must be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This principle emphasizes the need for mechanisms or processes that allow for independent confirmation that the TCB operates as intended and correctly enforces security policies."
What insights can be derived from the analysis of the TCB's size and its implications for system design?,"Analyzing the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) reveals several critical insights for system design. A system with a smaller TCB is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made, and fewer assumptions reduce the likelihood of those assumptions being violated, which aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle.\n\nHowever, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB also presents a greater challenge. The reduced size means that the system needs to account for a potentially larger number of malicious entities or attack vectors, as the trusted core is more constrained in its scope and interactions."
Describe the different types of attackers based on their operational methods.,"Attackers can be categorized into two main types based on their operational methods: Active and Passive.\n\n*   **Active attackers:** These attackers aim to manipulate or disrupt systems. Their actions typically involve modifying data or injecting code into the system, directly interfering with its operation and integrity.\n*   **Passive attackers:** In contrast, passive attackers focus on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation. Their goal is to collect sensitive data or intelligence without being detected, often through methods like eavesdropping or data interception."
Explain the various aspects of an attacker's knowledge that are considered in a threat model.,"In a threat model, an attacker's knowledge is considered across different aspects to assess potential vulnerabilities. These aspects include:\n\n*   **Detailed System Knowledge:** The attacker may possess comprehensive knowledge of the system's design, architecture, source code, and other internal workings. This level of insight allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks.\n*   **Lack of Detailed Knowledge:** Alternatively, an attacker might lack detailed knowledge of the system. In such cases, they must rely on probing, trial and error, or other exploratory methods to discover vulnerabilities and gain access. This often involves less precise, but potentially still effective, attack strategies."
What factors define an attacker's capability within a threat model?,"An attacker's capability within a threat model is defined by several key factors that determine their potential effectiveness and reach. These factors include:\n\n*   **Computing Resources:** The amount of computing resources an attacker can leverage directly impacts the complexity and scale of attacks they can execute, such as brute-force attacks or sophisticated data processing.\n*   **System Interaction:** The specific parts of the system that an attacker can interact with dictate their potential points of entry and the scope of their influence within the system.\n*   **Time Constraints:** Whether an attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly significantly influences their strategy. Attackers with ample time can conduct more thorough reconnaissance and execute slower, more stealthy attacks, while those with limited time might opt for faster, potentially more disruptive methods."
"Analyse the common security properties, specifically the CIA model, and provide examples of threats they aim to prevent.","The Common Security Properties, often referred to as the CIA model, represent the fundamental security goals for a system. These properties are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.\n\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. It ensures that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. Threats prevented include Eavesdropping, Packet sniffing, and Illegal copying, where information is accessed by those without permission.\n*   **Integrity (I):** Integrity prevents the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. Threats prevented involve actions like Intercepting packets, Modifying them, and then Releasing them, which corrupts the data's authenticity.\n*   **Availability (A):** This property prevents the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources are always available for authorized users when needed. A primary threat prevented is the disruption of services, which makes resources inaccessible to legitimate users."
"Describe the 'Other properties' of security beyond the CIA model, focusing on how they enhance system trustworthiness.","Beyond the foundational CIA model, several other security properties enhance system trustworthiness by addressing different aspects of security and operational reliability:\n\n*   **Accountability:** This property ensures that the actions of an entity within the system can be traced and identified. It provides a record of who did what, which is crucial for auditing and forensic analysis.\n*   **Non-repudiation:** Non-repudiation provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. This means an entity cannot falsely deny having performed a particular action, establishing proof of origin or receipt.\n*   **Authenticity:** Authenticity ensures that the communicated entity is indeed the correct and claimed entity. It verifies the identity of users, systems, or data sources, preventing impersonation.\n*   **Anonymity or privacy:** This property aims to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. It protects sensitive personal data and ensures user privacy within the system.\n*   **Verifiability:** Verifiability means that the system's operations can be independently verified. This allows for external checks to confirm that the system is functioning correctly and securely.\n*   **Freshness:** Freshness ensures that data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. This prevents replay attacks where old, legitimate messages are resent to achieve an unauthorized effect.\n*   **Fault tolerance:** Fault tolerance allows the system to continue functioning correctly despite failures. It ensures resilience and continuous operation even when components or processes encounter issues."
"What was the nature of the malware used in the Target attack case study, and how did it operate?","In the Target attack case study, the malware used was identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" which is a type of RAM scraper. This malware collected unencrypted payment card information immediately after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal's memory. The code of ""Trojan.POSRAM"" bore a strong resemblance to ""BlackPOS,"" another type of POS malware. However, the Target malware contained a new attack method that allowed it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers, making it particularly difficult to detect."
Analyse the data exfiltration process in the Target credit card data breach.,"The data exfiltration process in the Target credit card data breach involved a multi-stage approach. The malware, identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" collected approximately 11GB of data from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals over a period of two weeks. This data, consisting of unencrypted payment card information, was first quietly moved to another server within Target's internal network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked. Finally, the stolen credit card numbers of millions of Target shoppers were sent to a server located in Russia, completing the international trip of the compromised data."
"What security property was the primary concern in the Target attack case study, and why?","In the Target attack case study, the primary security property of concern was **Confidentiality**. Confidentiality is defined as the prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. This was the central concern because the attack involved malicious software collecting and exfiltrating unencrypted credit card data from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals, leading to the unauthorized disclosure of millions of shoppers' sensitive financial information to attackers."
Explain the three main security strategies for protecting a system.,"The three main security strategies for protecting a system are Prevention, Detection, and Reaction.\n\n*   **Prevention:** This strategy involves taking measures that actively stop a system from being damaged in the first place. The goal is to avert security incidents before they occur, such as implementing strong access controls or patching vulnerabilities.\n*   **Detection:** This strategy focuses on implementing measures that allow for the identification of when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged. Detection mechanisms, like intrusion detection systems or security logs, aim to alert administrators to ongoing or past security breaches.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction strategy involves taking measures to recover a system from damage or to mitigate the impact of an attack. This includes incident response plans, data backups for recovery, and the proactive assumption that bad things will happen, leading to preparations for the worst-case outcome."
Analyse the 'Least of Privilege' design principle and its importance in secure system design.,"The 'Least of Privilege' is a fundamental design principle in secure system design that dictates how permissions should be assigned. Its importance lies in minimizing the potential harm that can be caused by a compromised entity or a malfunctioning program.\n\nThis principle requires assigning privileges carefully by:\n\n*   **Minimal Permissions:** Giving each entity only the absolute minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task. This limits the scope of damage if the entity is compromised.\n*   **Just-in-Time Privilege:** Granting privileges only when they are specifically needed and revoking them immediately after their use. This reduces the window of opportunity for privilege abuse.\n*   **Harm Reduction:** The less privilege a program or entity has, the less harm it can inflict if it goes awry or becomes subverted by an attacker. This directly reduces the attack surface.\n*   **Preventing Abuse:** Granting unnecessary permissions creates an opportunity for malicious entities to abuse those permissions to perform attacks that would otherwise be impossible. For example, a photo editing application should only access the gallery, not the microphone or location, to prevent potential privacy breaches."
What insights can be derived from the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle regarding critical processes?,"The 'Separation of Privilege' design principle provides crucial insights into managing critical processes by splitting responsibility. The core idea is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical operations.\n\nKey insights include:\n\n*   **Multiple Parties for Privileged Actions:** To perform a privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision. This introduces a check-and-balance mechanism.\n*   **Reduced Single Point of Failure:** By distributing control, the principle prevents a single individual's mistake, malicious intent, or a single system's compromise from leading to a catastrophic failure or breach of a critical process. For instance, in a financial system, transferring large sums of money requires approval from an employee (initiator) and an additional approval from a manager (reviewer), ensuring no single person can unilaterally complete the transaction."
Define 'Unbypassable' in the context of TCB design principles.,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design principles, 'Unbypassable' refers to the completeness requirement. It means that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. The TCB is designed to be an inescapable security perimeter, ensuring that all security-critical operations and data flows are mediated and protected by it, without any possible alternative routes for an attacker to circumvent its controls."
Define 'Tamper-resistant' as a TCB design principle.,"As a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design principle, 'Tamper-resistant' refers to the security requirement that the TCB should be protected against other parts of the system outside the TCB. This means that these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or its operational state. The principle ensures the integrity and reliability of the TCB by preventing unauthorized alterations from less trusted components of the system."
Define 'Verifiable' in the context of TCB design principles.,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design principles, 'Verifiable' (or correctness) means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This principle emphasizes the ability to confirm that the TCB operates precisely as intended and correctly enforces its security policies, ensuring its reliability and trustworthiness through independent checks or proofs."
Explain the KISS principle as it applies to TCB size.,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, when applied to the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), suggests that a smaller TCB is inherently more desirable. A smaller TCB is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components and interactions. Fewer assumptions reduce the complexity and the potential for hidden vulnerabilities or violations of those assumptions, thereby simplifying the process of ensuring its security and correctness."
What is an 'Active' attacker and what are typical examples of their actions?,"An 'Active' attacker is a type of attacker whose primary goal is to manipulate or disrupt systems. Typical examples of their actions include modifying data within the system or injecting malicious code. These actions directly interfere with the system's normal operation, integrity, or confidentiality, aiming to achieve specific malicious objectives."
What is a 'Passive' attacker and what are their objectives?,"A 'Passive' attacker is a type of attacker whose objective is to observe and gather information without interfering with the system. Their goal is to collect sensitive data or intelligence, such as user credentials or confidential communications, without being detected. They do not modify data or disrupt services, focusing solely on stealthy information acquisition."
Define 'Confidentiality' as a security property and provide an example of a threat it addresses.,"Confidentiality (C) is a common security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. It ensures that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties. An example of a threat it addresses is eavesdropping, where an unauthorized entity secretly listens to private communications to gain access to confidential data."
Define 'Integrity' as a security property and provide an example of a threat it addresses.,"Integrity (I) is a common security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. An example of a threat it addresses is when an attacker intercepts packets, modifies their content, and then releases them, thereby corrupting the original, legitimate data."
Define 'Availability' as a security property and provide an example of a threat it addresses.,"Availability (A) is a common security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources are always available for authorized users when needed. An example of a threat it addresses is the disruption of services, which makes legitimate users unable to access the system or its resources."
Define 'Accountability' as a security property.,"Accountability is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This means that there is a record or mechanism to determine who performed a specific action within a system, which is crucial for auditing, incident response, and establishing responsibility."
Define 'Non-repudiation' as a security property.,"Non-repudiation is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. This means that an entity cannot falsely deny having performed a particular action, such as sending a message or executing a transaction, thereby establishing proof of origin or receipt."
Define 'Authenticity' as a security property.,"Authenticity is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity. It verifies the identity of users, systems, or data sources, confirming that they are who or what they claim to be, thereby preventing impersonation and ensuring trust in communications."
Define 'Anonymity or privacy' as a security property.,Anonymity or privacy is a security property that aims to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. Its purpose is to protect sensitive personal data and ensure that an individual's identity or private activities cannot be linked back to them without authorization.
Define 'Verifiability' as a security property (distinct from TCB's 'Verifiable').,"Verifiability, as a general security property, means that the system's operations can be independently verified. This allows for external checks and audits to confirm that the system is functioning correctly, securely, and in accordance with its specifications, providing assurance beyond internal assertions."
Define 'Freshness' as a security property.,"Freshness is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. This property is critical for preventing replay attacks, where old, legitimate messages or data are resent to achieve an unauthorized or unintended effect."
Define 'Fault tolerance' as a security property.,"Fault tolerance is a security property that ensures the system can continue to function correctly despite failures. This means that even if certain components or processes within the system encounter issues or fail, the overall system remains operational and maintains its intended functionality, enhancing its resilience and reliability."
Describe the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in the context of the Target attack threat model.,"In the context of the Target attack threat model, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to the Target computer system, which includes its operating system (OS) and hardware. This TCB is considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the ""Trojan.POSRAM"" malware, is explicitly *not* trusted. The threat model acknowledges that this untrusted malicious software is capable of leaking data to an attacker, highlighting a critical vulnerability within the otherwise trusted hardware and OS environment."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge assumed in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the assumed adversarial capabilities and knowledge included the ability of the attacker to launch malware on the Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was then capable of collecting credit card data stored in the database. This assumption highlights that the attacker possessed the means to infiltrate the POS environment and extract sensitive information, indicating a sophisticated level of operational capability and understanding of the target system's data handling."
Explain the 'Prevention' security strategy.,"The 'Prevention' security strategy involves taking measures that are designed to stop a system from being damaged in the first place. The primary goal of prevention is to avert security incidents and breaches before they can occur, thereby maintaining the system's integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Examples include implementing firewalls, strong authentication, and regular software patching."
Explain the 'Detection' security strategy.,"The 'Detection' security strategy focuses on implementing measures that enable the identification of when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged. This strategy is crucial for recognizing security incidents that have bypassed prevention mechanisms. Detection systems, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) tools, and audit logs, aim to provide timely alerts and forensic data to understand the nature and scope of an attack."
Explain the 'Reaction' security strategy.,"The 'Reaction' security strategy involves taking measures to recover a system from damage or to mitigate the impact of a security incident. This strategy operates on the principle of assuming that bad things will inevitably happen, and therefore, systems must be prepared for the worst-case outcome. Reaction measures include incident response plans, data backup and recovery procedures, disaster recovery planning, and forensic analysis to understand the breach and prevent future occurrences."
Provide an example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for a smartphone application.,"An example of the 'Least of Privilege' principle in practice for a smartphone application is a photo editing application. This application is only allowed access to the user's gallery to retrieve and save images, which are its core functions. Crucially, it is *not* granted access to the microphone or location services, as these permissions are unnecessary for its intended purpose. This restriction minimizes the potential harm if the application were to be compromised, preventing it from illicitly recording audio or tracking the user's whereabouts."
Provide an example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle in practice within a software development context.,"An example of the 'Separation of Privilege' principle in practice within a software development context is the deployment process. A developer writes code, but they are explicitly prevented from directly deploying that code to production environments. Instead, deployment is handled by a separate operations team. This separation ensures that no single individual has full control over both code creation and its release to live systems, minimizing the risk of malicious code injection, errors, or unauthorized changes reaching critical production infrastructure."
How does a smaller TCB contribute to trustworthiness and ease of verification?,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) contributes to trustworthiness and ease of verification primarily because it reduces complexity. With fewer components and interactions within the TCB, there are fewer assumptions that need to be made about its behavior and security. This reduction in assumptions means there are fewer potential points of failure or vulnerabilities that could be exploited, making the TCB easier to analyze, audit, and formally verify for correctness, thus increasing its overall trustworthiness."
What is the challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"The challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that it requires considering more malicious entities. While a smaller TCB is easier to verify and more trustworthy, its reduced scope means that the security mechanisms must be extremely robust and comprehensive to protect against a wider array of potential threats and attack vectors that might exist outside its minimized trusted perimeter."
How does an attacker's lack of detailed knowledge influence their attack strategy?,"When an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system's design, architecture, or source code, their attack strategy must rely on probing or trial and error. Instead of exploiting known vulnerabilities or design flaws, they will attempt various inputs, observe system responses, and systematically test different approaches to discover weaknesses or gain unauthorized access. This often involves techniques like port scanning, fuzzing, or social engineering to gather information incrementally."
What is the significance of an attacker's computing resources in a threat model?,"The significance of an attacker's computing resources in a threat model lies in their ability to leverage these resources to execute more complex, resource-intensive, or faster attacks. For example, substantial computing power can enable brute-force attacks against passwords, cryptographic keys, or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Higher resources can also facilitate faster data processing for reconnaissance or exfiltration, impacting the feasibility and speed of various attack types."
How does the ability of an attacker to interact with specific parts of a system influence the threat model?,"The ability of an attacker to interact with specific parts of a system significantly influences the threat model by defining their potential points of entry and the scope of their influence. If an attacker can interact with critical components, they might be able to bypass security controls, inject malicious code, or access sensitive data. Conversely, if their interaction is limited to non-critical, isolated parts, the potential impact of a breach is reduced. This factor helps in identifying critical assets and prioritizing security measures."
Why is it important to consider whether an attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly?,"It is important to consider whether an attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly because this factor dictates the types of attacks they can employ and the likelihood of detection. An attacker with unlimited time can conduct extensive reconnaissance, develop highly sophisticated and stealthy attacks, and patiently wait for opportune moments, making detection more challenging. Conversely, an attacker needing to act quickly might resort to faster, potentially noisier, or less refined methods, which could increase their chances of detection but achieve rapid impact."
How does 'Eavesdropping' relate to the security property of Confidentiality?,"'Eavesdropping' directly relates to the security property of Confidentiality as it represents a primary threat against it. Eavesdropping involves an unauthorized party secretly listening to or intercepting private communications or data transmissions. This action leads to the unauthorized disclosure of information, which is precisely what Confidentiality aims to prevent, ensuring that sensitive data remains private and accessible only to authorized entities."
How does 'Packet sniffing' relate to the security property of Confidentiality?,"'Packet sniffing' is a direct threat to the security property of Confidentiality. It involves capturing and analyzing data packets as they travel across a network. By doing so, an unauthorized party can gain access to the contents of these packets, leading to the unauthorized disclosure of information. Confidentiality aims to prevent such disclosures, ensuring that sensitive data transmitted over a network remains private."
How does 'Illegal copying' relate to the security property of Confidentiality?,"'Illegal copying' directly relates to the security property of Confidentiality as it constitutes a threat that leads to the unauthorized disclosure of information. When data is illegally copied, it means that an unauthorized party has duplicated sensitive information, making it accessible to individuals or systems that should not have access. Confidentiality aims to prevent such unauthorized duplication and dissemination of sensitive data."
"How do actions like 'Intercept packets, Modify and release' relate to the security property of Integrity?","Actions such as 'Intercept packets, Modify and release' directly relate to the security property of Integrity because they involve the unauthorized alteration of information. When an attacker intercepts data packets, changes their content, and then retransmits them, they are corrupting the original, legitimate data. Integrity aims to prevent precisely this type of unauthorized modification, ensuring that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered by malicious parties."
How does 'Disrupt services' relate to the security property of Availability?,"'Disrupt services' directly relates to the security property of Availability as it represents a primary threat against it. When services are disrupted, it means that authorized users are prevented from accessing information or resources that should be readily available to them. Availability aims to ensure that resources are always accessible and usable by authorized users, and service disruption directly undermines this goal."
Why is 'Non-repudiation' important for establishing trust in transactions?,"'Non-repudiation' is important for establishing trust in transactions because it provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred, preventing any party from falsely denying their involvement. In a transaction, this means that the sender cannot deny having sent a message, and the receiver cannot deny having received it. This irrefutable proof of origin and receipt is crucial for legal enforceability, accountability, and building confidence among transacting parties."
How does 'Freshness' protect against certain types of attacks?,"'Freshness' protects against certain types of attacks, specifically replay attacks, by ensuring that data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. In a replay attack, an attacker captures legitimate data or messages and retransmits them at a later time to achieve an unauthorized effect. By verifying the freshness of data, systems can detect and reject these replayed messages, thereby preventing the attacker from exploiting outdated or previously valid information."
What is the role of 'Fault tolerance' in maintaining system security?,"The role of 'Fault tolerance' in maintaining system security is to ensure the system's continued operation and availability even when components or processes fail. While not directly preventing breaches, it contributes to security by ensuring that critical services remain accessible and functional despite unexpected failures, which could otherwise be exploited by attackers to cause denial of service or create vulnerabilities during recovery periods. It enhances resilience and robustness against disruptions."
Why is it crucial to 'Give each entity the minimal permissions to complete the task' under the Least of Privilege principle?,"It is crucial to 'Give each entity the minimal permissions to complete the task' under the Least of Privilege principle because it significantly limits the potential damage if that entity is compromised or malfunctions. By restricting permissions to only what is absolutely necessary, an attacker who gains control of that entity will have a much narrower scope of actions they can perform, thereby containing the impact of a breach and preventing unauthorized access to other parts of the system."
"Explain the concept of 'giving privilege when needed, and revoking the privilege after use' in the context of Least of Privilege.","The concept of 'giving privilege when needed, and revoking the privilege after use' in the context of the Least of Privilege principle emphasizes temporary and just-in-time access. Instead of granting permanent elevated permissions, an entity receives the necessary privilege only for the duration required to complete a specific task. Once the task is finished, the privilege is immediately revoked. This practice minimizes the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit elevated permissions, even if they manage to compromise the entity, thereby reducing the overall attack surface."
"How does the 'less privilege that a program has, the less harm it can do if it goes awry or becomes subverted' statement relate to system security?","The statement 'the less privilege that a program has, the less harm it can do if it goes awry or becomes subverted' directly relates to system security by highlighting the principle of damage containment. If a program, due to a bug or malicious subversion, starts behaving unexpectedly or maliciously, its ability to cause harm is directly proportional to the permissions it holds. By limiting its privileges, any unintended or malicious actions it performs will be restricted in scope, preventing it from accessing or modifying critical system resources it doesn't need, thus minimizing the overall security impact."
"Why is it important to 'Minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes' under Separation of Privilege?","It is important to 'Minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes' under the Separation of Privilege principle because it creates a system of checks and balances. If a single entity (whether a person or a system component) holds complete control, it becomes a single point of failure. This increases the risk of: 1) **Misuse:** Deliberate malicious actions by that entity. 2) **Error:** Unintentional mistakes leading to system compromise or data corruption. 3) **Compromise:** An attacker gaining control of that single entity, thereby gaining full control over the critical process. By requiring multiple entities, each with partial control, to cooperate, the principle significantly reduces these risks."
"What specific type of malware was identified in the Target attack, and what was its primary function?","The specific type of malware identified in the Target attack was ""Trojan.POSRAM."" Its primary function was to act as a RAM scraper, collecting unencrypted payment card information. This collection occurred immediately after the cards were swiped at Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals and while the data resided in the terminal's memory."
How did the Target malware evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers?,"The Target malware, ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" contained a new attack method that allowed it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. While similar to ""BlackPOS,"" this new method made it hard to detect the malware's presence and its activities, particularly the exfiltration of sensitive credit card data, by obscuring its operations from security analysts and tools."
What was the initial destination of the stolen credit card data within Target's network before it was sent externally?,"The stolen credit card data, after being collected by the malware from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals, was first quietly moved to another server on Target's internal network. This internal transfer occurred before the data was transmitted in chunks to an external U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, and subsequently to a server in Russia."
What is the purpose of the 'Attacker's Assumption' section in a threat model?,"The purpose of the 'Attacker's Assumption' section in a threat model is to define the characteristics, knowledge, and capabilities of potential adversaries. This includes specifying the type of attacker (active or passive), their level of knowledge about the system (detailed or relying on trial and error), and their available resources and time constraints. By clearly outlining these assumptions, the threat model can accurately assess potential risks and design appropriate security measures against realistic threats."
"How does the 'KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle' apply to the design of a TCB?","The 'KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle' applies to the design of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by advocating for a smaller TCB. A smaller TCB is inherently simpler, making it more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a simpler design requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components and interactions, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated and simplifying the process of proving its correctness and security."
What is the primary goal of 'Security Properties' in system design?,"The primary goal of 'Security Properties' in system design is to define the security objectives that the system aims to achieve. These properties, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA model), along with others like Accountability and Non-repudiation, serve as the foundational goals that guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system's security mechanisms to protect its assets from various threats."
