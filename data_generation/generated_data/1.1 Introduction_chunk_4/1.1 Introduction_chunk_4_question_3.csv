What are the core design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The core design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable. \n\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible way to breach system security by circumventing the TCB. \n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** This means the TCB must be protected against other parts of the system that are outside the TCB. These external parts should not be able to modify the TCB's code or its operational state. \n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** It should be possible to independently verify the correctness and proper functioning of the TCB."
How does the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) relate to its trustworthiness and design challenges?,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions, which might otherwise be violated. This approach aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging, as it necessitates considering a greater number of potential malicious entities."
What is the KISS principle in the context of TCB design?,"In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, the KISS principle, which stands for 'Keep It Simple, Stupid,' suggests that a simpler design is generally better. For a TCB, this means that a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made, thereby decreasing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated."
Describe the different types of attackers based on their actions.,Attackers can be categorized into two main types based on their actions: Active and Passive. \n\n*   **Active attackers:** These attackers manipulate or disrupt systems. Examples include modifying data or injecting malicious code. \n*   **Passive attackers:** These attackers focus on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation.
What defines an active attacker?,An active attacker is defined as an entity that manipulates or disrupts systems. This can involve actions such as modifying data or injecting code into a system.
What is a passive attacker?,A passive attacker is an entity that observes and gathers information without interfering with the system. Their actions do not disrupt the system's normal operation.
What are the different levels of knowledge an attacker might possess about a system?,"An attacker's knowledge about a system can vary significantly. They might either: \n\n*   Possess detailed knowledge of the system's design, architecture, source code, and other internal specifics. \n*   Lack detailed knowledge and, as a result, must rely on probing, trial and error methods to understand and exploit the system."
What factors determine an attacker's capability?,An attacker's capability is determined by several factors: \n\n*   **Computing resources:** How much computing power and infrastructure the attacker can leverage. \n*   **System interaction:** What specific parts of the system the attacker can interact with. \n*   **Time constraints:** Whether the attacker has unlimited time to carry out an attack or needs to act quickly.
What is the primary goal of defining security properties?,The primary goal of defining security properties is to establish the security objectives that a system aims to achieve.
Explain the Common Security Properties (CIA model).,"The Common Security Properties, often referred to as the CIA model, consist of three fundamental principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. \n\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive data is not leaked to unauthorized parties. \n*   **Integrity (I):** This property focuses on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. \n*   **Availability (A):** This property seeks to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources, ensuring that resources are always accessible to authorized users."
What is Confidentiality in the context of security properties?,Confidentiality (C) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. Its purpose is to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties.
Define Integrity as a security property.,Integrity (I) is a security property that focuses on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties.
What does Availability mean in security?,Availability (A) is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that the necessary resources are always available for authorized users.
Provide examples of actions that breach confidentiality.,"Actions that breach confidentiality include eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying of information. These actions involve unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data."
What are examples of integrity breaches?,"Examples of integrity breaches include intercepting packets, modifying them, and then releasing them. These actions involve unauthorized modification of information."
How can availability be breached?,"Availability can be breached by actions that disrupt services, thereby preventing authorized users from accessing information or resources."
What is Accountability in security properties?,Accountability is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified.
Define Non-repudiation.,"Non-repudiation is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions have occurred, preventing an entity from denying their actions."
What is Authenticity in security?,Authenticity is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is indeed the correct and legitimate entity.
Explain Anonymity or privacy as a security property.,Anonymity or privacy is a security property that aims to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties.
What is Verifiability in the context of security properties?,Verifiability is a security property that ensures a system's operations can be independently verified for correctness.
Define Freshness as a security property.,Freshness is a security property that ensures data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed.
What is Fault tolerance in security?,Fault tolerance is a security property that allows a system to continue functioning correctly despite encountering failures.
Describe the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in the Target attack threat model.,"In the Target attack threat model, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) includes the Target computer system, its operating system (OS), and hardware, all of which are considered trusted. However, the malicious software involved in the attack is explicitly not trusted, as it was responsible for leaking data to the attacker."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge assumed in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge assumed that the attacker could launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was then used to collect credit card data stored in the database."
Which security property was primarily considered in the Target attack threat model?,"The security property primarily considered in the Target attack threat model was confidentiality. The focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically credit card data."
What type of malware was used in the Target credit card data breach?,"The malware used in the Target credit card data breach was identified as 'Trojan.POSRAM,' which is a type of RAM scraper. It collected unencrypted payment card information just after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory."
How much data was collected by the malware in the Target breach and where was it sent?,"Over two weeks, the malware collected 11GB of data from Target's POS terminals. This data was initially moved to another server on Target's network, then transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server hijacked by attackers, and finally sent to a server in Russia."
What made the Target malware particularly difficult to detect?,"The Target malware, while similar to 'BlackPOS,' contained a new attack method that specifically evaded forensic detection and concealed data transfers, making it hard to detect its presence and activities."
What is the definition of the 'Prevention' security strategy?,The 'Prevention' security strategy involves taking measures that are designed to stop your system from being damaged in the first place.
Explain the 'Detection' security strategy.,"The 'Detection' security strategy involves taking measures that enable you to identify when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged."
What does the 'Reaction' security strategy entail?,"The 'Reaction' security strategy involves taking measures to recover your system from damage. It also emphasizes the importance of always assuming that negative events will occur and, therefore, preparing your systems for the worst-case outcome."
What is the core principle of 'Least of Privilege' in system design?,The core principle of 'Least of Privilege' is to assign privileges carefully by giving each entity only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task.
How should privileges be assigned according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, privileges should be assigned carefully by: \n\n*   Giving each entity only the minimal permissions required to complete its task. \n*   Granting privileges only when they are needed and revoking them after use. \n*   Recognizing that the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can inflict if it malfunctions or is compromised. \n*   Understanding that granting unnecessary permissions can allow a malicious entity to abuse those permissions to perform an attack."
Provide an example of applying the 'Least of Privilege' principle in an operating system context.,"An example of applying the 'Least of Privilege' principle in an operating system context is to never perform personal activities using a root or administrator account. These accounts possess elevated privileges that are not necessary for routine personal tasks, and using them for such activities increases the risk of system compromise."
Give an example of 'Least of Privilege' for a smartphone application.,"An example of 'Least of Privilege' for a smartphone application is a photo editing application that is only allowed access to the gallery. It is not granted access to the microphone or location, as these permissions are not necessary for its core function."
What is the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle?,"The 'Separation of Privilege' design principle involves splitting responsibility for privileged actions. It requires multiple parties to work together to exercise a privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision. This approach minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes."
What is the main benefit of implementing the 'Separation of Privilege' principle?,"The main benefit of implementing the 'Separation of Privilege' principle is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise. This is achieved by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes, requiring multiple parties to collaborate for privileged actions."
Provide an example of 'Separation of Privilege' in a financial system.,"In a financial system, an example of 'Separation of Privilege' is when transferring large sums of money requires approval from an employee, who acts as the initiator, and an additional approval from a manager, who acts as the reviewer. This ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a significant financial transaction."
Give an example of 'Separation of Privilege' in a software development context.,"In a software development context, an example of 'Separation of Privilege' is when a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, deployment is handled by a separate operations team. This separation prevents a single individual from both creating and releasing potentially flawed or malicious code into a live environment."
Why are design principles important for TCB?,"Design principles are important for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to ensure its fundamental security properties. Principles like Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable guarantee that the TCB is robust against circumvention, protected from internal and external modification, and its correctness can be confirmed, thereby establishing trust in the system's security foundation."
Explain the relationship between the size of a TCB and its trustworthiness.,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components, and fewer assumptions mean a lower chance of those assumptions being violated, thus increasing overall reliability and ease of verification."
What makes designing a secure system with a smaller TCB challenging?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is more challenging because it requires considering a greater number of malicious entities. While a smaller TCB is easier to verify, the design process must account for a broader range of potential threats given the reduced scope of trusted components."
How does an active attacker typically disrupt or manipulate systems?,An active attacker typically disrupts or manipulates systems through actions such as modifying data or injecting code. These actions directly interfere with the system's intended operation and state.
How does a passive attacker gather information without interfering with a system?,"A passive attacker gathers information by observing the system. This involves monitoring communications and data flows without actively modifying or disrupting the system's operations, such as through eavesdropping or packet sniffing."
What approach does an attacker take if they lack detailed knowledge of a system's design?,"If an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system's design, architecture, or source code, they must rely on probing or trial and error methods to understand the system's vulnerabilities and behavior."
What is 'disclosure of information' in the context of security properties?,"In the context of security properties, 'disclosure of information' refers to the act of revealing sensitive data to unauthorized parties. Preventing this unauthorized disclosure is the primary goal of the Confidentiality security property."
What is 'modification of information' in the context of security properties?,"In the context of security properties, 'modification of information' refers to the unauthorized alteration of data, critical system state, or code. Preventing such unauthorized changes is the primary goal of the Integrity security property."
What is 'withholding of information or resources' in the context of security properties?,"In the context of security properties, 'withholding of information or resources' refers to the act of preventing authorized users from accessing necessary data or system resources. Preventing this unauthorized withholding is the primary goal of the Availability security property."
How does the Target attack case study exemplify a breach of confidentiality?,The Target attack case study exemplifies a breach of confidentiality because the malicious software launched on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems collected unencrypted credit card data and subsequently leaked this sensitive information to the attacker. This unauthorized disclosure of private customer data directly violates the principle of confidentiality.
