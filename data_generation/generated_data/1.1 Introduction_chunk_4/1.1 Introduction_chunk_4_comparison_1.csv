Compare the Unbypassable design principle with the Tamper-resistant design principle for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The Unbypassable and Tamper-resistant principles are both critical design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible way to breach system security by circumventing or bypassing the TCB. It ensures that all security-critical operations must pass through the TCB.\n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** This principle states that the TCB itself should be protected against other parts of the system that are outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or state, ensuring the integrity and security of the TCB's internal workings."
What are the differences between the Unbypassable and Verifiable design principles of a TCB?,"The Unbypassable and Verifiable principles are distinct design considerations for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle focuses on ensuring that the TCB cannot be circumvented. It means there should be no path to breach system security by bypassing the TCB, guaranteeing that the TCB is always in control of security-critical functions.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** This principle emphasizes the ability to confirm the TCB's proper functioning. It should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB, meaning its design and implementation can be proven to behave as intended and correctly enforce security policies."

This prevents external components from altering the TCB's code or state.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** This principle focuses on the ability to ascertain the TCB's accuracy and reliability. It means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB, confirming that it operates as designed and correctly implements its security functions."
Compare the benefits and challenges associated with designing a system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"Designing a system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) presents both significant benefits and challenges.\n*   **Benefits of a smaller TCB:** A system with a smaller TCB is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because fewer assumptions need to be made about its behavior, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This approach aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which advocates for simplicity to enhance reliability and maintainability.\n*   **Challenges of designing a smaller TCB:** Despite the benefits, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging. This is due to the need to consider a greater number of malicious entities and potential attack vectors, as the reduced complexity of the TCB itself might require more rigorous analysis of external interactions."

Compare the design principles of Least of Privilege and Separation of Privilege.,"The design principles of Least of Privilege and Separation of Privilege are both fundamental for secure system design, but they address different aspects of privilege management.\n*   **Least of Privilege:** This principle dictates that each entity (user, program, process) should be given only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task. Privileges should be granted only when needed and revoked after use. The core idea is that the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can do if compromised or if it malfunctions. Granting unnecessary permissions creates opportunities for malicious entities to abuse them.\n*   **Separation of Privilege:** This principle requires that a privileged action necessitates multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision. It aims to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. For example, in a financial system, transferring large sums of money might require approval from both an initiator and a manager."
"What are the implications of an attacker knowing the system's design, architecture, and source code compared to an attacker who lacks detailed knowledge?","The extent of an attacker's knowledge significantly impacts their approach and potential success.\n*   **Attacker knowing the system's design, architecture, source code, etc.:** An attacker with this detailed knowledge has a profound advantage. They can identify vulnerabilities more efficiently, understand the system's internal workings, and craft highly targeted and effective attacks. This knowledge allows for precise exploitation without extensive trial and error.\n*   **Attacker lacking detailed knowledge and relying on probing or trial and error:** An attacker without detailed knowledge must resort to less efficient methods. They will typically engage in probing, scanning, and trial-and-error attempts to discover vulnerabilities or gain information. This approach is often slower, noisier, and more prone to detection, as they are essentially guessing or systematically exploring the system's surface."
Compare the implications of an attacker having unlimited time versus needing to act quickly.,"The time constraints on an attacker significantly influence their strategy and the types of attacks they can execute.\n*   **Attacker with unlimited time:** An attacker with unlimited time can afford to be patient and thorough. They can conduct extensive reconnaissance, perform slow and stealthy probing, and develop sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that are difficult to detect. This allows for a higher chance of success with minimal risk of exposure.\n*   **Attacker needing to act quickly:** An attacker under time pressure must prioritize speed and efficiency. They are more likely to use readily available exploits, conduct rapid and potentially noisy attacks, and may forgo thorough reconnaissance. While they might achieve quick results, their actions are often more detectable, and the success rate might be lower due to less preparation."

"What are the differences between the malware ""Trojan.POSRAM"" and ""BlackPOS"" as described in the Target attack case study?","The Target attack case study mentions ""Trojan.POSRAM"" and ""BlackPOS"" as types of Point-of-Sale (POS) malware, with a specific distinction.\n*   **BlackPOS:** This is described as another type of POS malware that cyberattackers had been using as far back as March 2013. ""Trojan.POSRAM"" bears a strong resemblance to ""BlackPOS."".\n*   **Trojan.POSRAM:** While similar to BlackPOS, the Target malware, identified as ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" contains a new attack method. This new method specifically evades forensic detection and conceals data transfers, making it harder to detect compared to its predecessor. Both are RAM scrapers that collect unencrypted payment card information."
Compare the general concept of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) with its specific application in the Target attack threat model.,"The general concept of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to all the protection mechanisms within a computer system, including hardware and software, that are essential for enforcing the security policy. In the context of the Target attack threat model, the TCB is specifically defined.\n*   **General TCB:** A TCB encompasses all components whose correct operation is critical for enforcing the system's security policy. Its design principles include being unbypassable, tamper-resistant, and verifiable.\n*   **TCB in Target attack threat model:** In this specific case, the Target computer system, including its Operating System (OS) and hardware, is considered trusted. However, the malicious software (malware) is explicitly *not* trusted, as it is responsible for leaking data to the attacker. This highlights that the TCB's trust boundary is drawn around the legitimate system components, excluding the adversarial elements."
Compare the adversarial capabilities with the attacker's knowledge in the context of the Target attack threat model.,"In the Target attack threat model, both adversarial capabilities and attacker's knowledge are crucial assumptions that define the threat.\n*   **Adversarial capabilities:** The attacker's capabilities are defined by their ability to launch malware on the Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This includes the ability to execute malicious code that can collect credit card data stored in the database.\n*   **Attacker's knowledge:** The attacker's knowledge is implied by their ability to develop and deploy malware like ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" which can collect unencrypted payment card information from POS terminal memory. While not explicitly detailed in the case study, this suggests a level of understanding of POS system vulnerabilities and data handling. The case study focuses on the *outcome* of this knowledge (malware deployment and data collection) rather than a general statement about knowing system design."
Compare the general security property of Confidentiality with its specific consideration in the Target attack case study.,"Confidentiality is a fundamental security property, and its specific consideration in the Target attack case study highlights its practical importance.\n*   **General Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. It ensures that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties, applying broadly to all types of sensitive data.\n*   **Confidentiality in Target attack case study:** In the context of the Target attack, confidentiality was the specific security property considered. The primary goal was protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically the credit card data collected by the malware from the POS terminals and stored in the database. This demonstrates a real-world scenario where the breach of confidentiality led to a significant data compromise."
Compare the act of data collection by malware with the act of data transmission by malware in the Target attack.,"In the Target attack, the malware engaged in both data collection and data transmission, which are distinct phases of the attack.\n*   **Data collection by malware:** The ""Trojan.POSRAM"" malware collected unencrypted payment card information. This occurred just after the cards were swiped at Target and while the data sat in a POS terminal's memory. This process involved the malware acting as a RAM scraper to extract sensitive data.\n*   **Data transmission by malware:** After collection, the data was not immediately sent out. It was first quietly moved to another server on Target's internal network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, and then eventually sent to a server in Russia. This transmission phase involved exfiltrating the collected data from the compromised system."
Compare the principle of granting minimal permissions with the implications of granting unnecessary permissions under the Least of Privilege design principle.,"The Least of Privilege design principle emphasizes careful assignment of permissions, contrasting the benefits of minimal permissions with the risks of unnecessary ones.\n*   **Granting minimal permissions:** This involves giving each entity (user, program) only the exact permissions required to complete its specific task. This approach reduces the attack surface, as a compromised entity has limited capabilities, thereby minimizing the potential harm it can inflict if it goes awry or becomes subverted. Privileges should also be granted only when needed and revoked after use.\n*   **Implications of granting unnecessary permissions:** If unnecessary permissions are granted, a malicious entity could abuse those permissions to perform an attack. This expands the scope of what an attacker can do if they compromise an entity, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data, modify critical system components, or escalate privileges beyond their intended scope."
"Compare the approach of requiring multiple parties for a privileged action with having a single point of control for critical processes, in the context of the Separation of Privilege design principle.","The Separation of Privilege design principle advocates for distributing control over critical actions, contrasting it with the risks of a single point of control.\n*   **Requiring multiple parties for a privileged action:** This approach mandates that to perform a privileged action, multiple distinct parties must work together to exercise that privilege. This means no single individual or entity has unilateral authority over critical operations. For example, a financial transaction might require approval from both an initiator and a manager.\n*   **Having a single point of control for critical processes:** This approach, which Separation of Privilege aims to avoid, means that one entity has full control over critical processes. This significantly increases the risk of misuse, error, or compromise, as a single malicious actor, mistake, or system vulnerability could lead to a complete breach or failure of the critical process. By splitting responsibility, the principle minimizes these risks."

It is crucial for preventing replay attacks and ensuring the timeliness and validity of information, which can be important for ensuring that available resources provide correct and up-to-date information."
Compare the security properties of Confidentiality and Fault tolerance.,"Confidentiality and Fault tolerance are security properties that address different aspects of system protection and resilience.\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. It ensures that sensitive data is kept private and is only accessible to authorized parties.\n*   **Fault tolerance:** This property ensures that the system can continue to function correctly despite failures. It focuses on the system's ability to withstand and recover from errors or component malfunctions without complete shutdown or data loss, which is generally unrelated to preventing information disclosure."
What are the differences between the security properties of Integrity and Fault tolerance?,"Integrity and Fault tolerance are security properties that both contribute to the reliability of a system, but with different focuses.\n*   **Integrity (I):** This property prevents unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code remain unaltered by malicious parties, maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data.\n*   **Fault tolerance:** This property ensures that the system can continue to function correctly despite failures. It focuses on the system's ability to withstand and recover from errors or component malfunctions without complete shutdown or data loss, which can help preserve data integrity during failures."
Compare the security properties of Availability and Fault tolerance.,"Availability and Fault tolerance are closely related security properties that both aim to ensure continuous system operation.\n*   **Availability (A):** This property prevents the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources are always available for authorized users when needed, focusing on uninterrupted access.\n*   **Fault tolerance:** This property ensures that the system can continue to function correctly despite failures. It focuses on the system's ability to withstand and recover from errors or component malfunctions without complete shutdown or data loss. Fault tolerance is a key mechanism for achieving high availability, as it allows a system to remain operational even when components fail."
