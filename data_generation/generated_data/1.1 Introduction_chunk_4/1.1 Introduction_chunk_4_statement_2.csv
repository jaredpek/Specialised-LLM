Define the three core design principles of TCB.,"The three core design principles of TCB are Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable.\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible method to breach system security by circumventing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).\n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** This principle requires that the TCB be protected against interference from other parts of the system that are outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or its operational state.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** This principle states that it should be feasible to confirm the correctness and proper functioning of the TCB."
Explain the relationship between the size of a TCB and its trustworthiness and verifiability.,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its operation, and these assumptions are less likely to be violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which advocates for simplicity in design to reduce complexity and potential vulnerabilities."
What is the KISS principle and how does it relate to TCB design?,"The KISS principle, which stands for ""Keep It Simple, Stupid,"" is a design philosophy that advocates for simplicity. In the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, it relates to the idea that a system with a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made, thereby decreasing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated and enhancing the overall security and reliability of the system."
Discuss the challenges associated with designing a secure system that utilizes a smaller TCB.,"While a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) generally leads to a more trustworthy and verifiable system, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging. This increased challenge arises because a smaller TCB often necessitates considering a greater number of malicious entities or potential attack vectors. The design must be robust enough to withstand threats from a broader range of adversaries, despite the reduced complexity of the TCB itself."
Differentiate between an active attacker and a passive attacker based on their methods.,"An **active attacker** is characterized by their intent and capability to manipulate or disrupt systems. Examples of their methods include modifying data or injecting code into a system. In contrast, a **passive attacker** focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with or altering the system's operation. Their actions are limited to surveillance and data collection."
Describe the two primary categories of an attacker's knowledge as outlined in the document.,"The document outlines two primary categories regarding an attacker's knowledge. The first category is when an attacker possesses detailed knowledge, such as knowing the system's design, architecture, or source code. The second category describes an attacker who lacks this detailed knowledge and, as a result, must rely on methods like probing, trial and error to gain information or exploit vulnerabilities."
What factors define an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's capability is defined by several factors, including:\n*   **Computing resources:** How much computational power and infrastructure the attacker can leverage.\n*   **System interaction:** What specific parts of the system the attacker is able to interact with.\n*   **Time constraints:** Whether the attacker has unlimited time to conduct their operations or if they are required to act quickly."
Provide an example of an action an active attacker might take.,"An example of an action an active attacker might take is modifying data within a system. This falls under their characteristic ability to manipulate or disrupt systems, as opposed to merely observing them. Another example is injecting malicious code."
Provide an example of an action a passive attacker might take.,An example of an action a passive attacker might take is observing network traffic to gather information. This aligns with their characteristic of observing and gathering information without interfering with the system.
Define Confidentiality as a security property within the CIA model.,"**Confidentiality (C)**, as a security property within the CIA model, is the principle of preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. This means that sensitive information should be protected from being leaked or accessed by parties who are not authorized to view it. Examples of breaches include eavesdropping, packet sniffing, and illegal copying of data."
Define Integrity as a security property within the CIA model.,"**Integrity (I)**, as a security property within the CIA model, is the principle of preventing unauthorized modification of information. This ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. Breaches of integrity can involve intercepting packets, modifying their content, and then releasing them."
Define Availability as a security property within the CIA model.,"**Availability (A)**, as a security property within the CIA model, is the principle of preventing unauthorized withholding of information or resources. This means that the system's resources and information should always be accessible and available for use by authorized users when needed. A common example of an availability breach is the disruption of services."
List the three common security properties that form the CIA model.,The three common security properties that form the CIA model are:\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** Prevents unauthorized disclosure of information.\n*   **Integrity (I):** Prevents unauthorized modification of information.\n*   **Availability (A):** Prevents unauthorized withholding of information or resources.
What are some examples of actions that violate Confidentiality?,Actions that violate Confidentiality include:\n*   **Eavesdropping:** Secretly listening to private conversations or communications.\n*   **Packet sniffing:** Intercepting and inspecting data packets as they travel across a network.\n*   **Illegal copying:** Unauthorized duplication of sensitive information or data.\nThese actions all lead to the unauthorized disclosure of information.
What is an example of an action that violates Integrity?,"An example of an action that violates Integrity is when an attacker intercepts data packets, modifies their content, and then releases them back into the system. This unauthorized alteration of information directly breaches the principle of integrity, which aims to prevent unauthorized modification of data and critical system states."
What is an example of an action that violates Availability?,"An example of an action that violates Availability is the disruption of services. This occurs when an attacker prevents authorized users from accessing information or resources that should be readily available to them, thereby withholding the necessary system functionality."
Define Accountability as a security property.,"**Accountability** is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This means that there should be a record or mechanism to determine who performed a specific action within a system, allowing for auditing and responsibility assignment."
Define Non-repudiation as a security property.,"**Non-repudiation** is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. This means that an entity cannot legitimately deny having performed a particular action, as there is irrefutable proof of their involvement."
Define Authenticity as a security property.,"**Authenticity** is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity. This means verifying the identity of a user, system, or piece of information to confirm it is genuine and not an imposter or a tampered version."
Define Anonymity or privacy as a security property.,**Anonymity or privacy** is a security property focused on hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. This ensures that individuals' sensitive data and identifying details remain confidential and are not disclosed without authorization.
Define Verifiability as a security property.,**Verifiability** is a security property that states the system's operations can be independently verified. This means that there are mechanisms or processes in place to allow for external or independent confirmation that the system is functioning as intended and its actions are correct.
Define Freshness as a security property.,"**Freshness** is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed. This prevents attacks where old, legitimate data or messages are retransmitted to trick a system into accepting them as new, valid interactions."
Define Fault tolerance as a security property.,"**Fault tolerance** is a security property that ensures the system can continue to function correctly despite failures. This means that even if certain components or processes within the system encounter issues or fail, the overall system remains operational and maintains its intended functionality."
"List four ""other"" security properties beyond the CIA model.","Four ""other"" security properties beyond the CIA model are:\n*   **Accountability:** Actions of an entity can be traced and identified.\n*   **Non-repudiation:** Unforgeable evidence that specific actions occur.\n*   **Authenticity:** Ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity.\n*   **Anonymity or privacy:** Hides personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties."
Describe the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in the context of the Target attack case study.,"In the context of the Target attack case study, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to the Target computer system, which includes its operating system (OS) and hardware. These components are considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the malware launched by the attacker, is explicitly *not* trusted, as it was responsible for leaking data to the attacker."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge demonstrated in the Target attack?,"In the Target attack, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge involved the attacker's ability to launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware then collected credit card data stored in the database. This indicates the attacker had the capability to deploy malicious code and the knowledge to target specific system components for data exfiltration."
Which specific security property was the primary concern in the Target attack case study?,"The specific security property that was the primary concern in the Target attack case study was **Confidentiality**. The threat model explicitly states that the focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, which is the core objective of confidentiality. The attack involved the unauthorized disclosure of credit card data."
What type of malware was identified in the Target attack and what was its function?,"The malware identified in the Target attack was ""Trojan.POSRAM,"" which is described as a **RAM scraper**. Its function was to collect unencrypted payment card information immediately after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory. This allowed the attackers to capture sensitive data before it could be encrypted or secured."
How did the attackers in the Target case study exfiltrate the stolen credit card data?,"The attackers in the Target case study exfiltrated the stolen credit card data in a multi-stage process. First, the data was quietly moved to another server within Target's internal network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked. Finally, the data was sent to a server located in Russia."
How long did the attackers remain undetected in Target's network?,"The attackers remained undetected in Target's network for more than two weeks. During this period, the malicious software collected approximately 11GB of data from Target's POS terminals."
What was the total volume of data collected by the malware in the Target attack?,The malware collected 11GB of data from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals during the attack.
"What was the relationship between ""Trojan.POSRAM"" and ""BlackPOS"" malware?","The code of ""Trojan.POSRAM"" bore a strong resemblance to ""BlackPOS,"" which is another type of POS malware that had been used by cyberattackers as far back as March 2013. However, the Target malware (""Trojan.POSRAM"") contained a new attack method that allowed it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers, making it harder to detect compared to its predecessor."
Define the security strategy of Prevention.,**Prevention** as a security strategy involves taking measures that are designed to stop your system from being damaged in the first place. These measures are proactive steps aimed at averting security incidents and protecting system assets from harm.
Define the security strategy of Detection.,"**Detection** as a security strategy involves taking measures that enable you to identify when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. These measures are focused on monitoring and alerting, allowing for the recognition of security breaches or compromises after they have occurred."
Define the security strategy of Reaction.,"**Reaction** as a security strategy involves taking measures to recover your system from damage. This also includes the crucial principle of always assuming that negative events will occur and, therefore, preparing your systems for the worst-case outcome. This strategy focuses on incident response and business continuity."
List the three main security strategies.,"The three main security strategies are:\n*   **Prevention:** Taking measures to prevent your system from being damaged.\n*   **Detection:** Taking measures to detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged.\n*   **Reaction:** Taking measures to recover your system from damage, including preparing for worst-case outcomes."
"Explain the core principle of ""Least of Privilege.""","The core principle of **Least of Privilege** dictates that each entity within a system should be assigned only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its designated task. This means granting privileges only when they are needed and revoking them after use. The underlying rationale is that the less privilege a program or entity has, the less harm it can inflict if it malfunctions, goes awry, or becomes subverted by a malicious entity. Granting unnecessary permissions creates an opportunity for abuse and attack."
"Why is it important to revoke privileges after use, according to the Least of Privilege principle?","According to the Least of Privilege principle, it is important to revoke privileges after use to minimize potential harm. Granting privileges only when needed and revoking them immediately after their task is complete reduces the window of opportunity for those privileges to be abused. If a program or entity were to go awry or become subverted, having fewer active privileges limits the scope of damage it could cause."
Provide an example of applying the Least of Privilege principle in an operating system context.,"An example of applying the Least of Privilege principle in an operating system context is to never perform personal activities using a root or administrator account. These accounts possess elevated privileges that are far beyond what is necessary for routine personal tasks. By using a standard user account for daily activities, the potential harm from malware or accidental misconfigurations is significantly reduced, as the standard account has minimal permissions."
How does the Least of Privilege principle apply to smartphone applications?,"The Least of Privilege principle applies to smartphone applications by ensuring they are granted only the necessary permissions for their intended function. For example, a photo editing application should only be allowed access to the gallery to retrieve and save images. It should not be granted access to the microphone or location services, as these permissions are irrelevant to its core functionality and could be abused if the application were compromised."
What is the potential risk of granting unnecessary permissions to an entity?,"The potential risk of granting unnecessary permissions to an entity is that a malicious entity could abuse those permissions to perform an attack. If a program or user has more privileges than required for its legitimate tasks, an attacker who compromises that entity can leverage those excess permissions to gain unauthorized access, modify critical data, or disrupt system operations, leading to greater harm."
"Explain the core concept of ""Separation of Privilege.""","The core concept of **Separation of Privilege** is to split responsibility for privileged actions. Instead of a single entity having full control or making a sole decision for a critical process, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege. This design principle aims to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity possesses complete control over critical processes, thereby requiring collusion or multiple failures for a breach to occur."
How does Separation of Privilege minimize risk?,"Separation of Privilege minimizes risk by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. By requiring multiple parties to cooperate to perform a privileged action, it reduces the likelihood of misuse, error, or compromise. A single malicious actor or an accidental mistake by one individual cannot unilaterally bypass security measures or cause significant damage, as multiple approvals or actions are needed."
Provide an example of Separation of Privilege in a financial system.,"In a financial system, an example of Separation of Privilege is when transferring large sums of money. This action typically requires approval from an employee, who acts as the initiator, and then additional approval from a manager, who serves as the reviewer. This ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a significant financial transaction, thereby minimizing the risk of fraud or error."
Provide an example of Separation of Privilege in a software development and deployment context.,"In a software development and deployment context, an example of Separation of Privilege is when a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, the deployment process is handled by a separate operations team. This separation ensures that the individual who creates the code does not also have the sole authority to release it into the live environment, reducing the risk of malicious code injection or accidental deployment errors."
"What does ""completeness"" refer to in the context of TCB design principles?","In the context of TCB design principles, ""completeness"" refers to the **Unbypassable** characteristic. It means there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). The TCB must comprehensively mediate all security-relevant operations, ensuring no security-critical path can circumvent its control."
"What does ""security"" refer to in the context of TCB design principles?","In the context of TCB design principles, ""security"" refers to the **Tamper-resistant** characteristic. It means the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state, ensuring its integrity and preventing unauthorized alterations that could compromise security."
"What does ""correctness"" refer to in the context of TCB design principles?","In the context of TCB design principles, ""correctness"" refers to the **Verifiable** characteristic. It means it should be possible to verify the correctness of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). This implies that the TCB's design and implementation can be rigorously examined and proven to function as intended, without flaws that could lead to security vulnerabilities."
What are the implications if an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system?,"If an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system, such as its design, architecture, or source code, the implication is that they must rely on alternative methods to understand and exploit it. These methods typically involve **probing** the system, which means actively sending inputs and observing outputs to infer its behavior, or using **trial and error**, where they attempt various actions until one yields a desired result or reveals a vulnerability."
"Explain the overall goal of ""Security Properties"" for a system.","The overall goal of ""Security Properties"" for a system is to define and achieve the specific security objectives that the system aims to uphold. These properties, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA model), along with others like Accountability and Non-repudiation, represent the desired states of security that the system must maintain to protect its assets and operations from various threats. They serve as benchmarks against which the system's security posture is evaluated."
