Summarize the design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The design principles of a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** are:\n\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** There must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB.\n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** The TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state.\n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** It should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB.\n\nA **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** refers to the set of all hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical to enforcing the security policy of a system."
Discuss the implications of the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The size of a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** has significant implications for system security and trustworthiness.\n\n*   **Smaller TCB:** A system with a smaller TCB is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because fewer assumptions need to be made, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This concept aligns with the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle**, which advocates for simplicity in design to enhance reliability and maintainability.\n*   **Challenges of Smaller TCB:** Despite the benefits, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging. This is because a smaller TCB implies a more concentrated and critical set of components, requiring careful consideration of a potentially wider range of malicious entities and attack vectors.\n\nA **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is the collection of all security-relevant hardware, firmware, and software components within a system."
Define an 'Active' type of attacker.,"An **Active attacker** is a type of attacker whose primary goal is to manipulate or disrupt systems. This can involve actions such as modifying data or injecting malicious code into the system. Unlike passive attackers, active attackers directly interfere with the system's operations."
Define a 'Passive' type of attacker.,"A **Passive attacker** is a type of attacker focused on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operations. Their activities do not disrupt the system's normal functioning, but rather aim to collect sensitive data or intelligence."
What are the different levels of knowledge an attacker might possess?,"An attacker's knowledge can vary significantly, influencing their attack strategies:\n\n*   **Detailed Knowledge:** Some attackers may possess detailed knowledge of the system's design, architecture, and even its source code. This allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks.\n*   **Limited Knowledge:** Other attackers may lack detailed knowledge and, as a result, must rely on probing, trial and error, or reconnaissance to understand the system's vulnerabilities and structure.\n\nUnderstanding the attacker's knowledge level is crucial for designing effective security measures."
What are the key considerations regarding an attacker's capability?,"When assessing an attacker's capability, several key considerations are important:\n\n*   **Computing Resources:** How much computing resources can the attacker leverage? This includes processing power, storage, and network bandwidth, which can impact the scale and speed of an attack.\n*   **System Interaction:** What parts of the system can the attacker interact with? Understanding accessible interfaces and components helps in identifying potential attack surfaces.\n*   **Time Constraints:** Does the attacker have unlimited time, or do they need to act quickly? Time constraints can influence the complexity and duration of an attack, with more time allowing for more persistent and elaborate methods."
Summarize the common security properties as defined by the CIA model.,"The common security properties, often referred to as the **CIA model**, represent the fundamental goals for securing a system:\n\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information, ensuring that sensitive data is not leaked to unauthorized parties.\n*   **Integrity (I):** This property focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties.\n*   **Availability (A):** This property ensures that information or resources are not withheld from authorized users without authorization. Resources should always be accessible to those who are permitted to use them.\n\nThese three properties form the cornerstone of information security."
Explain the security property of Confidentiality and provide examples of its violation.,**Confidentiality (C)** is a security property that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. Its goal is to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to unauthorized parties.\n\nExamples of confidentiality violations include:\n\n*   **Eavesdropping:** Covertly listening to private communications.\n*   **Packet sniffing:** Intercepting and analyzing data packets traveling over a network.\n*   **Illegal copying:** Unauthorized duplication of data or files.
Describe the security property of Integrity and illustrate it with examples of attacks.,"**Integrity (I)** is a security property designed to prevent unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code remain unaltered by malicious parties, maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of data.\n\nAn example of an integrity violation includes:\n\n*   **Intercept packets, Modify and release:** An attacker intercepts data packets, alters their content, and then releases them back into the network, leading to corrupted or false information."
"What is the security property of Availability, and what does its violation entail?","**Availability (A)** is a security property that prevents the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources are always available for authorized users when needed.\n\nA violation of availability typically entails **disrupting services**, making them inaccessible to legitimate users. This could be through denial-of-service attacks or other means that prevent access to systems or data."
List other important security properties beyond the CIA triad.,"Beyond the core CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), other important security properties include:\n\n*   **Accountability:** Actions of an entity can be traced and identified.\n*   **Non-repudiation:** Unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred.\n*   **Authenticity:** Ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity.\n*   **Anonymity or privacy:** Hides personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties.\n*   **Verifiability:** The system's operations can be independently verified.\n*   **Freshness:** Data or communications are current and not reused or replayed.\n*   **Fault tolerance:** The system can continue to function correctly despite failures."
Define the security property of Accountability.,"**Accountability** is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity within a system can be traced and identified. This means that there is a record or mechanism to determine who performed what action, which is crucial for auditing, incident response, and deterring malicious behavior."
Explain the concept of Non-repudiation in security.,"**Non-repudiation** is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. It prevents an entity from denying that they performed an action, such as sending a message or executing a transaction. This evidence is typically cryptographic and legally binding."
What does the security property of Authenticity ensure?,"**Authenticity** is a security property that ensures the communicated entity is indeed the correct and claimed entity. It verifies the identity of users, systems, or data sources, preventing impersonation and ensuring trust in interactions."
Describe the security property of Anonymity or Privacy.,**Anonymity or privacy** is a security property focused on hiding personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. It aims to protect an individual's sensitive data and ensure that their actions or presence cannot be linked back to their identity without authorization.
What is meant by Verifiability as a security property?,"**Verifiability** is a security property that means the system's operations can be independently verified. This implies that there are mechanisms or processes in place to confirm that the system is functioning as intended and adhering to its security policies, often through audits or formal methods."
Explain the security property of Freshness.,"**Freshness** is a security property that ensures data or communications are current and have not been reused or replayed. It protects against replay attacks where old, legitimate messages are retransmitted by an attacker to achieve an unauthorized effect."
Define the security property of Fault Tolerance.,"**Fault tolerance** is a security property that enables a system to continue functioning correctly despite failures. This means that even if certain components or processes fail, the system can maintain its operations and provide its services without complete disruption, enhancing reliability and availability."
What are the general components of a threat model?,"A **threat model** generally considers several key components to understand potential security risks:\n\n*   **Trusted Computing Base (TCB):** Identifies which parts of the system are trusted and which are not, highlighting where vulnerabilities might exist if trust is misplaced.\n*   **Adversarial Capabilities and Knowledge:** Assesses what an attacker can do and what information they possess, informing the types of attacks that are feasible.\n*   **Security Properties:** Specifies which security goals (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability) are most critical to protect for the system."
Describe the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) in the context of the Target attack case study.,"In the context of the Target attack case study, the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** included the Target computer system, encompassing its operating system (OS) and hardware. These components were considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the RAM scraper malware, was explicitly *not* trusted, as it was responsible for leaking sensitive credit card data to the attacker. This highlights a critical failure within the assumed trust boundary."
Summarize the adversarial capabilities and knowledge relevant to the Target attack.,"In the Target attack, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge involved the attacker's ability to launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was capable of collecting credit card data stored in the database. The attacker's knowledge allowed them to exploit vulnerabilities to deploy this malicious software and exfiltrate sensitive financial information."
Which security property was the primary concern in the Target attack case study?,"In the Target attack case study, the primary security property of concern was **Confidentiality**. The goal was to protect the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically credit card data, to unauthorized parties. The breach demonstrated a failure in maintaining the confidentiality of customer financial information."
Provide a summary of the Target credit card data breach based on the provided news information.,"The Target credit card data breach involved the theft of millions of shoppers' credit card numbers, which were sent to a server in Russia. The data was quietly moved around Target's network for over two weeks before being transmitted to a U.S.-based server hijacked by attackers, and then to Russia. The malicious software, identified as 'Trojan.POSRAM,' collected unencrypted payment card information from POS terminals' memory immediately after cards were swiped. This malware was a RAM scraper, similar to 'BlackPOS,' but included new attack methods to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers, making it hard to detect."
Describe the Trojan.POSRAM malware used in the Target attack.,"The **Trojan.POSRAM** malware was the specific malicious software used in the Target attack. It was a RAM scraper that collected unencrypted payment card information directly from a Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal's memory immediately after a card was swiped. While bearing a strong resemblance to 'BlackPOS,' Trojan.POSRAM incorporated new attack methods designed to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers, making it particularly difficult to detect."
What is BlackPOS malware and its relation to Trojan.POSRAM?,"**BlackPOS** is a type of Point-of-Sale (POS) malware that cyberattackers were using as early as March 2013. The Trojan.POSRAM malware, which was used in the Target attack, bears a strong resemblance to BlackPOS, indicating a shared lineage or similar functionality in scraping payment card data from POS systems."
What new attack methods did the Target malware (Trojan.POSRAM) incorporate?,"The Target malware, Trojan.POSRAM, incorporated new attack methods designed to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. These advanced techniques made it significantly harder for security teams to identify and respond to the breach, allowing the malware to operate undetected for an extended period."
Summarize the three main categories of security strategies.,"The three main categories of security strategies are:\n\n*   **Prevention:** Measures taken to stop a system from being damaged in the first place.\n*   **Detection:** Measures designed to identify when, how, and by whom a system has been damaged.\n*   **Reaction:** Measures implemented to recover a system from damage or to recover from the damage itself.\n\nThese strategies work together to create a comprehensive security posture."
Explain the Prevention security strategy.,"The **Prevention** security strategy involves taking measures that actively prevent a system from being damaged. This includes implementing controls, safeguards, and policies designed to stop security incidents from occurring, such as firewalls, access controls, and encryption."
Describe the Detection security strategy.,"The **Detection** security strategy focuses on implementing measures that allow for the identification of security incidents. This means being able to detect when a system has been damaged, understanding how the damage occurred, and identifying who was responsible. Examples include intrusion detection systems and security information and event management (SIEM) tools."
What is the purpose of the Reaction security strategy?,"The **Reaction** security strategy involves taking measures to recover a system from damage or to recover from the damage itself. This includes incident response plans, disaster recovery procedures, and backup and restoration processes. A key aspect of this strategy is to always assume that bad things will happen and to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome."
Why is it important to assume worst-case outcomes in security planning?,"It is important to assume that bad things will happen and to prepare systems for the worst-case outcome as part of a robust security strategy. This proactive approach, falling under the **Reaction** strategy, ensures that organizations have plans and measures in place to recover from potential damage, minimizing the impact of security incidents when they inevitably occur."
Summarize the design principle of Least of Privilege.,The **Design Principle of Least of Privilege** dictates that privileges should be assigned carefully. This means:\n\n*   **Minimal Permissions:** Each entity should be given only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its assigned task.\n*   **Just-in-Time Privilege:** Privileges should be granted only when needed and revoked immediately after use.\n*   **Harm Reduction:** A program with less privilege can cause less harm if it goes awry or becomes subverted by an attacker.\n*   **Attack Prevention:** Granting unnecessary permissions creates opportunities for malicious entities to abuse those permissions to perform attacks.\n\nThis principle minimizes the attack surface and potential damage from compromised entities.
What are the benefits of implementing the Least of Privilege principle?,"Implementing the **Least of Privilege** principle offers several benefits:\n\n*   **Reduced Attack Surface:** By limiting permissions, the potential pathways an attacker can exploit are minimized.\n*   **Containment of Damage:** If an entity is compromised, the damage it can inflict is restricted to only what its minimal privileges allow.\n*   **Improved System Stability:** Unnecessary permissions can sometimes lead to unintended system changes or errors, which are reduced with least privilege.\n*   **Enhanced Security:** It makes it harder for malicious entities to abuse permissions to perform attacks, as they won't have access to functions beyond their legitimate scope.\n\n**Least of Privilege** is a security principle where every module (such as a process, a user, or a program) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose."
Explain the risks associated with granting unnecessary permissions.,"Granting unnecessary permissions poses significant risks to system security. If an entity, whether a user or a program, has more privileges than required for its legitimate tasks, a malicious entity could abuse those excess permissions to perform an attack. This expands the attack surface and increases the potential damage that can be caused if that entity is compromised or goes awry. This directly violates the **Least of Privilege** principle, which advocates for providing only the minimal necessary permissions."
Provide examples illustrating the Least of Privilege design principle.,"Examples illustrating the **Least of Privilege** design principle include:\n\n*   **Operating System Accounts:** Never performing personal activities using a root or administrator account in an operating system. Instead, a standard user account with limited privileges should be used for daily tasks.\n*   **Application Permissions:** A photo editing application on a smartphone should only be allowed access to the gallery (where photos are stored) but not to the microphone or location services, as these are not necessary for its core function.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how limiting access to only what is essential reduces potential security risks."
Summarize the design principle of Separation of Privilege.,"The **Design Principle of Separation of Privilege** involves splitting responsibility to enhance security. Its core tenets are:\n\n*   **Multiple Parties for Privileged Actions:** To perform a privileged action, it requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege, rather than relying on a single point of control or decision.\n*   **Risk Minimization:** This approach minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes.\n\nThis principle prevents any one individual or component from having unchecked power, thereby reducing the likelihood of a single point of failure leading to a security breach."
What are the benefits of implementing the Separation of Privilege principle?,"Implementing the **Separation of Privilege** principle offers several benefits for system security:\n\n*   **Reduced Risk of Misuse:** By requiring multiple parties for privileged actions, it becomes harder for a single malicious actor or an accidental error to compromise a critical process.\n*   **Enhanced Accountability:** The involvement of multiple entities can increase accountability, as actions require coordination and approval.\n*   **Improved Security Posture:** It minimizes the risk of a single point of failure, making the system more resilient against attacks or internal errors.\n*   **Deterrence:** The need for collusion among multiple parties can deter malicious insiders.\n\n**Separation of Privilege** is a security principle that requires multiple conditions to be met or multiple parties to agree before a critical operation can be performed."
Provide examples illustrating the Separation of Privilege design principle.,"Examples illustrating the **Separation of Privilege** design principle include:\n\n*   **Financial System Transactions:** In a financial system, transferring large sums of money requires approval from an employee (the initiator) and an additional approval from a manager (the reviewer). This ensures that no single person can unilaterally authorize a high-value transaction.\n*   **Software Development and Deployment:** A developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, deployment is handled by a separate operations team. This separation prevents a single individual from introducing potentially malicious or erroneous code directly into the live environment.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how splitting critical responsibilities across multiple entities enhances security."
Explain the 'Unbypassable' aspect of TCB design principles.,"The 'Unbypassable' aspect, also known as **completeness**, is a fundamental design principle for a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**. It mandates that there must be absolutely no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations and data flows must pass through and be controlled by the TCB, ensuring that its security mechanisms cannot be circumvented."
What does 'Tamper-resistant' mean for TCB security?,"For a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**, 'Tamper-resistant' refers to the **security** principle that the TCB should be protected against other parts of the system that lie outside its boundary. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or state. This protection is crucial to ensure the integrity and reliability of the TCB's security functions, as any unauthorized alteration could compromise the entire system's security."
Describe the 'Verifiable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Verifiable' principle, also known as **correctness**, in **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** design states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis, testing, or formal methods to confirm that it behaves exactly as intended and correctly enforces the system's security policy."
How does the KISS principle relate to the size of a TCB?,"The **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle** directly relates to the size of a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** by advocating for simplicity. A system with a smaller TCB is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components. Fewer assumptions mean a reduced chance of those assumptions being violated, thereby simplifying the verification process and enhancing overall security. The KISS principle encourages minimizing complexity to improve reliability and security."
Differentiate between an attacker's knowledge and their capability.,"An attacker's **knowledge** refers to what they know about a system, such as its design, architecture, or source code, or conversely, their lack of detailed knowledge, forcing them to rely on probing. An attacker's **capability**, on the other hand, refers to their resources and means of interaction, such as how much computing resources they can leverage, what parts of the system they can interact with, and whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly. While knowledge informs *how* an attacker might plan an attack, capability dictates *what* they can actually execute."
What are the overarching security goals that the CIA model aims to achieve for a system?,"The **CIA model** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) defines the overarching security goals that aim to achieve a secure system.\n\n*   **Confidentiality** aims to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.\n*   **Integrity** aims to prevent unauthorized modification of information.\n*   **Availability** aims to prevent unauthorized withholding of information or resources.\n\nTogether, these properties ensure that information is protected from unauthorized access, alteration, and denial of service, forming the foundation of information security."
How does confidentiality prevent data leakage?,"**Confidentiality** prevents data leakage by ensuring that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized parties. This means implementing measures to protect data from being accessed, viewed, or copied by individuals or systems that do not have the necessary permissions. Examples of data leakage prevention include encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels."
How does integrity prevent unauthorized modification?,"**Integrity** prevents unauthorized modification by ensuring that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. This is achieved through mechanisms that detect or prevent changes to data and software by unauthorized entities. Examples include cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and strict access controls that limit write permissions."
How does availability ensure resources are accessible to authorized users?,"**Availability** ensures that information or resources are not withheld from authorized users by preventing unauthorized disruptions or denial of service. This means designing systems to be resilient, redundant, and capable of handling expected loads and failures, so that legitimate users can always access the resources they need when they need them. Measures include redundant systems, load balancing, and disaster recovery plans."
How do the security properties of Anonymity/Privacy and Accountability relate to each other?,"**Anonymity or privacy** aims to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties, focusing on protecting an individual's identity. In contrast, **Accountability** ensures that the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. These two properties can sometimes be in tension, as enhancing anonymity might make accountability more challenging, and vice-versa. The balance between them depends on the specific security requirements and legal/ethical considerations of a system."
"How do Prevention, Detection, and Reaction strategies work together for damage control?","The **Prevention**, **Detection**, and **Reaction** security strategies work synergistically for comprehensive damage control.\n\n*   **Prevention** measures are the first line of defense, aiming to stop damage from occurring.\n*   **Detection** measures act as a safety net, identifying when prevention has failed and damage has occurred, along with details about the incident.\n*   **Reaction** measures then come into play to recover the system from the damage and mitigate its impact.\n\nThis layered approach ensures that even if initial defenses are breached, there are mechanisms to identify the breach and recover effectively, preparing for worst-case outcomes."
Differentiate between the design principles of Least of Privilege and Separation of Privilege.,"The **Design Principle of Least of Privilege** focuses on granting each entity (user, process, program) only the minimal permissions necessary to complete its specific task. Its goal is to limit the potential harm an entity can cause if compromised or misused.\n\nIn contrast, the **Design Principle of Separation of Privilege** focuses on splitting critical responsibilities so that a privileged action requires multiple parties or conditions to be met. Its goal is to prevent any single entity from having complete control over critical processes, thereby minimizing the risk of misuse, error, or compromise.\n\nWhile both aim to enhance security by limiting power, Least of Privilege restricts *what* an entity can do, while Separation of Privilege restricts *who* can do a critical action alone."
