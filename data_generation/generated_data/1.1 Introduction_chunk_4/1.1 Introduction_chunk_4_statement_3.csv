What are the fundamental design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The fundamental design principles of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are Unbypassable, Tamper-resistant, and Verifiable. \n\n*   **Unbypassable (completeness):** This principle dictates that there must be no possible way to breach system security by circumventing or bypassing the TCB. The TCB must be the sole arbiter of security decisions. \n*   **Tamper-resistant (security):** This principle states that the TCB should be protected against unauthorized interference from other parts of the system that lie outside the TCB. These external parts are explicitly prevented from modifying the TCB's code or its operational state. \n*   **Verifiable (or correctness):** This principle requires that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This means that the TCB's operations and logic can be independently checked to ensure they function as intended and uphold security policies."
Explain the relationship between the size of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and system trustworthiness.,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its correctness, and these assumptions are less likely to be violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which advocates for simplicity in design to reduce complexity and potential vulnerabilities. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging, as it necessitates considering a greater number of potential malicious entities and attack vectors within a more constrained and critical component."
Differentiate between an active attacker and a passive attacker based on their actions.,"The distinction between an active attacker and a passive attacker lies in their interaction with the system. \n\n*   An **active attacker** is characterized by their intent and ability to manipulate or disrupt systems. Examples of actions performed by an active attacker include modifying data, which involves altering existing information, or injecting code, which means introducing malicious programming into a system to change its behavior. \n*   A **passive attacker**, in contrast, focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operations. Their activities might include eavesdropping on communications or collecting data, but they do not alter the system's state or functionality."
Describe the two main categories of knowledge an attacker might possess regarding a system.,"An attacker's knowledge regarding a system can generally fall into two main categories: \n\n*   **Detailed Knowledge:** This category refers to attackers who possess comprehensive understanding of the system's internal workings. This includes knowing the system's design, its architecture, and having access to its source code. Such knowledge allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks. \n*   **Limited Knowledge:** This category describes attackers who lack detailed knowledge of the system's internals. Instead, they must rely on methods like probing, which involves systematically testing the system's responses to various inputs, or trial and error, where they repeatedly attempt different actions to discover vulnerabilities or gain access."
What factors define an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's capability is defined by several key factors: \n\n*   **Computing Resources:** This refers to the amount of processing power, storage, and network bandwidth an attacker can leverage. Greater resources can enable more complex attacks, faster brute-force attempts, or the ability to process large amounts of stolen data. \n*   **System Interaction Points:** This factor concerns what specific parts of the system the attacker can interact with. Understanding these interaction points helps in identifying potential entry points and attack surfaces. \n*   **Time Constraints:** This relates to whether the attacker has unlimited time to carry out their attack or if they need to act quickly? Attacks requiring speed might be less sophisticated but more disruptive, while those with unlimited time can be more stealthy and persistent."
Define Confidentiality as a security property within the CIA model.,"**Confidentiality (C)**, as a security property within the CIA model, is the principle that aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. This means that sensitive information should not be leaked or made accessible to unauthorized parties. The goal is to ensure that only individuals or systems with appropriate permissions can access and view specific data, thereby protecting it from eavesdropping, unauthorized copying, or other forms of illicit access."
Explain Integrity as a security property and provide an example of its violation.,"**Integrity (I)**, as a security property, is the principle that aims to prevent the unauthorized modification of information. This ensures that critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties. The goal is to maintain the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. An example of its violation is when an attacker intercepts packets, modifies their content, and then releases them, thereby altering the information being transmitted without authorization."
"What is Availability in the context of security properties, and how can it be compromised?","**Availability (A)**, as a security property, is the principle that aims to prevent the unauthorized withholding of information or resources. It ensures that resources, such as data, services, or systems, are always accessible and available for authorized users when needed. Availability can be compromised through actions that disrupt services, making them inaccessible to legitimate users. This could involve denial-of-service attacks or other means of overwhelming or disabling system resources."
Describe the three common security properties of the CIA model.,"The three common security properties of the CIA model are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. \n\n*   **Confidentiality (C):** This property aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information. It ensures that sensitive data is not leaked to or accessed by unauthorized parties. \n*   **Integrity (I):** This property focuses on preventing the unauthorized modification of information. It ensures that critical system state and code remain unaltered by malicious entities, maintaining data accuracy and trustworthiness. \n*   **Availability (A):** This property ensures that information and resources are not withheld without authorization. It guarantees that authorized users can always access the necessary resources and services when required."
"Provide examples of actions that breach Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.","Breaches of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability can be illustrated by the following actions: \n\n*   **Confidentiality breaches** include eavesdropping, which is secretly listening to private conversations or communications; packet sniffing, which involves intercepting and inspecting data packets traveling over a network; and illegal copying, which is making unauthorized duplicates of sensitive information. \n*   **Integrity breaches** typically involve intercepting packets, modifying their content, and then releasing them, thereby altering data in transit without authorization. \n*   **Availability breaches** are characterized by actions that disrupt services, making them inaccessible to authorized users, such as a denial-of-service attack."
Define Accountability as a security property.,"**Accountability** is a security property that ensures the actions of an entity can be traced and identified. This means that there is a record or mechanism to determine who performed what action, when, and where, making it possible to hold entities responsible for their behavior within a system."
What is Non-repudiation in the context of security properties?,"**Non-repudiation** is a security property that provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. This means that an entity cannot legitimately deny having performed a particular action, as there is irrefutable proof linking them to that action. It prevents participants in a communication or transaction from falsely denying that they sent a message or performed an action."
Explain the security property of Authenticity.,"**Authenticity** is a security property that aims to ensure the communicated entity is the correct entity. This means verifying the identity of a user, process, or system to confirm that they are who or what they claim to be. It prevents impersonation and ensures that interactions are with legitimate and trusted parties."
What does Anonymity or privacy mean as a security property?,"**Anonymity or privacy** as a security property refers to the ability to hide personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. This ensures that individuals can interact with a system or service without their personal details being revealed or compromised, protecting their privacy from unauthorized disclosure."
Define Verifiability in the context of system operations.,"**Verifiability** is a security property that states the system's operations can be independently verified. This means that there are mechanisms or processes in place that allow for external or independent checks to confirm that the system is functioning correctly and securely, and that its actions align with its intended design and security policies."
What is the security property of Freshness?,"**Freshness** is a security property that ensures the data or communications are current and not reused or replayed. This means that information being processed or transmitted is recent and has not been captured and re-sent by an attacker to deceive the system or gain unauthorized access. It protects against replay attacks where old, legitimate messages are retransmitted."
Explain the concept of Fault tolerance as a security property.,"**Fault tolerance** is a security property that describes a system's ability to continue to function correctly despite failures. This means that even if certain components or processes within the system encounter errors or cease to operate, the overall system can maintain its intended functionality and availability, preventing a complete system outage due to isolated failures."
List and briefly describe the 'Other properties' of security beyond the CIA model.,"Beyond the CIA model, other important security properties include: \n\n*   **Accountability:** Actions of an entity can be traced and identified. \n*   **Non-repudiation:** Provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred. \n*   **Authenticity:** Ensures the communicated entity is the correct entity. \n*   **Anonymity or privacy:** Hides personal information and identity from being leaked to external parties. \n*   **Verifiability:** The system's operations can be independently verified. \n*   **Freshness:** The data or communications are current and not reused or replayed. \n*   **Fault tolerance:** The system can continue to function correctly despite failures."
"In the Target attack case study, what was considered the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and what was untrusted?","In the Target attack case study, the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** was identified as the Target computer system, which included its operating system (OS) and hardware. These components were considered trusted. However, the malicious software, specifically the 'Trojan.POSRAM' malware, was explicitly not trusted. This untrusted malicious software was responsible for leaking sensitive credit card data to the attacker."
What were the adversarial capabilities and knowledge demonstrated in the Target attack threat model?,"In the Target attack threat model, the adversarial capabilities and knowledge involved the attacker's ability to launch malware on Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This malware was designed to collect credit card data stored in the database. The attacker leveraged this capability to infiltrate the system and exfiltrate sensitive financial information."
Which security property was the primary concern in the Target attack case study's threat model?,"In the Target attack case study's threat model, the primary security property of concern was **Confidentiality**. The focus was on protecting the system from leaking sensitive information, specifically the credit card data of customers, to unauthorized parties. The breach highlighted the failure to maintain the confidentiality of this critical data."
"According to the news summary, what type of malware was used in the Target attack and what did it do?","According to the news summary, the malware used in the Target attack was identified as 'Trojan.POSRAM', which is a type of **RAM scraper**. This malware collected unencrypted payment card information immediately after it was swiped at Target and while it resided in a POS terminal's memory. It was designed to extract sensitive financial data directly from the system's volatile memory."
How did the Target malware evade detection and conceal data transfers?,"The Target malware, identified as 'Trojan.POSRAM', contained a new attack method that allowed it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. While similar to 'BlackPOS', this new attack method specifically enabled it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. This innovation made the breach particularly hard to detect and allowed the attackers to operate undetected for an extended period, contributing to its prolonged undetected operation within Target's network."
Describe the path the stolen credit card data took from Target's network to the attacker's server.,"The stolen credit card data from Target's network followed a specific path to the attacker's server. Initially, the data was quietly moved around on Target's internal network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked. Finally, from this hijacked U.S. server, the data was sent to a server located in Russia."
How much data was collected by the malware from Target's POS terminals over what period?,"Over a period of two weeks, the malware collected a significant volume of data from Target's Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals. Specifically, it gathered 11 gigabytes (GB) of data, which primarily consisted of unencrypted payment card information."
Define the security strategy of Prevention.,"**Prevention** is a security strategy that involves taking measures designed to stop your system from being damaged in the first place. These measures are proactive steps implemented to avert security incidents, vulnerabilities, or attacks before they can cause harm to the system's assets or operations."
What is the purpose of the Detection security strategy?,"The purpose of the **Detection** security strategy is to implement measures that enable you to identify and understand when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. These measures are reactive, focusing on discovering security incidents after they have occurred or are in progress, providing insights into the nature and source of the damage."
Explain the security strategy of Reaction.,"**Reaction** is a security strategy that involves taking measures to recover your system from damage or to recover from a damage to your system. A key aspect of this strategy is to always assume that adverse events will occur and, therefore, to prepare your systems for the worst-case outcome. This includes having plans and procedures in place for incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity to minimize the impact of security breaches."
List and briefly describe the three main security strategies.,"The three main security strategies are Prevention, Detection, and Reaction. \n\n*   **Prevention:** This strategy involves taking proactive measures to prevent your system from being damaged. \n*   **Detection:** This strategy focuses on implementing measures to detect when, how, and by whom your system has been damaged. \n*   **Reaction:** This strategy entails taking measures to recover your system from damage, with an underlying assumption that bad things will happen, necessitating preparation for worst-case scenarios."
What is the core principle of 'Least of Privilege' in system design?,"The core principle of **Least of Privilege** in system design is to assign each entity, whether it's a user, process, or program, the minimal permissions necessary to complete its specific task. This means granting only the essential rights and access required for an entity to perform its legitimate functions, and nothing more."
How should privileges be managed according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, privileges should be managed carefully by giving them only when needed and revoking them after use. This dynamic approach ensures that an entity possesses elevated permissions only for the duration required to complete a specific task, minimizing the window of opportunity for potential abuse. Furthermore, the less privilege a program has, the less harm it can inflict if it goes awry or becomes subverted by malicious actors."
Why is it important to follow the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"It is important to follow the 'Least of Privilege' principle because it significantly reduces the potential harm a program can cause if it malfunctions or is compromised. If a program or entity is granted unnecessary permissions, a malicious entity could abuse those excessive permissions to perform an attack, gain unauthorized access, or cause widespread damage. By limiting privileges, the attack surface is reduced, and the impact of a security breach is contained."
Provide an example of applying the 'Least of Privilege' principle in an operating system context.,"An example of applying the 'Least of Privilege' principle in an operating system context is the recommendation to **never perform personal activities using a root or administrator account in an OS**. A root or admin account possesses extensive privileges that are far beyond what is needed for routine tasks like browsing the internet, checking email, or editing documents. By using a standard user account for such activities, the potential damage from malware or accidental misconfigurations is significantly reduced, as the standard account has limited permissions."
Give an example of 'Least of Privilege' for a smartphone application.,"An example of 'Least of Privilege' for a smartphone application is a photo editing application that is only allowed access to the gallery but not the microphone or location. A photo editor's core function is to manipulate images, which requires access to stored photos. However, it has no legitimate need for microphone access (for audio recording) or location services (for GPS data). By restricting its permissions to only what is essential for its function, the risk of the application secretly recording audio or tracking location is eliminated, even if the app itself is compromised."
What is the fundamental idea behind the 'Separation of Privilege' design principle?,"The fundamental idea behind the **'Separation of Privilege'** design principle is to split responsibility for privileged actions. Instead of a single entity having full control or making a sole decision, performing a privileged action requires multiple parties to work together to exercise that privilege. This distributed control minimizes the risk of misuse, error, or compromise by ensuring that no single entity possesses complete authority over critical processes."
How does 'Separation of Privilege' minimize risk?,"'Separation of Privilege' minimizes risk by ensuring that no single entity has full control over critical processes. By requiring multiple parties to cooperate for a privileged action, it reduces the likelihood of misuse, accidental error, or a successful compromise. If one party is compromised or makes a mistake, the other parties involved in the process can act as a check, preventing the unauthorized or erroneous action from being completed."
Provide an example of 'Separation of Privilege' in a financial system.,"An example of 'Separation of Privilege' in a financial system is when transferring large sums of money. Such an action typically requires approval from an employee, who acts as the **initiator**, and an additional, separate approval from a manager, who serves as the **reviewer**. This setup ensures that no single individual can unilaterally authorize a significant financial transaction, thereby minimizing the risk of fraud or error."
Illustrate 'Separation of Privilege' in a software development and deployment context.,"An illustration of 'Separation of Privilege' in a software development and deployment context is a scenario where a developer writes code but cannot directly deploy it to production. Instead, the deployment process is handled by a separate operations team. This separation ensures that the individual who creates the code does not also have the authority to release it into the live environment, reducing the risk of malicious code injection, accidental deployment of untested code, or unauthorized changes to the production system."
Explain the KISS principle in the context of TCB design.,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, in the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, suggests that a simpler TCB is inherently more secure and easier to verify. A smaller TCB implies less complexity, fewer lines of code, and a reduced number of components, which in turn means fewer potential vulnerabilities and a smaller attack surface. This simplicity makes it easier to reason about its correctness and trustworthiness, as fewer assumptions need to be made, and those assumptions are less likely to be violated."
What does it mean for an attacker to 'manipulate or disrupt the systems'?,"For an attacker to 'manipulate or disrupt the systems' means they are performing **active** attacks. This involves actions such as modifying data, which refers to altering existing information within the system, or injecting code, which is introducing unauthorized programming instructions into the system. These actions are intended to change the system's normal operation, compromise its integrity, or cause it to fail."
What are 'security goals' in the context of system design?,"In the context of system design, 'security goals' refer to the specific objectives or aims that a system is designed to achieve in terms of its security posture. These goals define what the system strives to protect and how it intends to protect it. The common security properties like Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA model) are examples of such fundamental security goals that systems aim to uphold."
How does 'Non-repudiation' differ from 'Accountability'?,"'Non-repudiation' and 'Accountability' are related but distinct security properties. \n\n*   **Accountability** ensures that actions of an entity can be traced and identified, meaning you can determine who did what. It focuses on the ability to attribute actions to specific entities. \n*   **Non-repudiation**, on the other hand, provides unforgeable evidence that specific actions occurred, preventing an entity from falsely denying that they performed an action. It goes a step further than mere traceability by providing irrefutable proof, making denial impossible."
What is a 'RAM scraper' as mentioned in the Target attack case study?,"A 'RAM scraper' is a type of malicious software, like the 'Trojan.POSRAM' mentioned in the Target attack case study, that is designed to collect sensitive information directly from a computer's Random Access Memory (RAM). In the context of Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, RAM scrapers are particularly dangerous because they can capture unencrypted payment card information, such as credit card numbers and expiration dates, while it is temporarily stored in memory during transaction processing, before it is encrypted or written to disk."
What was the significance of the Target malware being similar to 'BlackPOS' but having a new attack method?,"The significance of the Target malware, 'Trojan.POSRAM', being similar to 'BlackPOS' but possessing a new attack method lies in its enhanced stealth and persistence. While 'BlackPOS' was a known type of POS malware, the Target malware's new attack method specifically enabled it to evade forensic detection and conceal data transfers. This innovation made the breach particularly hard to detect and allowed the attackers to operate undetected for an extended period, highlighting the evolving sophistication of cyber threats."
Why is it important to 'always assume that bad things will happen' in security strategies?,"It is important to 'always assume that bad things will happen' as part of the **Reaction** security strategy because it fosters a proactive mindset for preparedness. By anticipating potential security incidents, organizations are compelled to prepare their systems for the worst-case outcome. This includes developing robust incident response plans, disaster recovery procedures, and business continuity strategies, ensuring that even when breaches or failures occur, the system can recover and minimize disruption effectively."
What is the potential danger of granting unnecessary permissions according to the 'Least of Privilege' principle?,"According to the 'Least of Privilege' principle, the potential danger of granting unnecessary permissions is that a malicious entity could abuse those permissions to perform an attack. If a program or user has more privileges than required for its legitimate functions, and it becomes compromised, an attacker can leverage those excessive permissions to gain unauthorized access, modify critical data, or execute malicious code, leading to a more severe security breach than if privileges were appropriately restricted."
What is the benefit of requiring multiple parties to work together for a privileged action?,"The benefit of requiring multiple parties to work together for a privileged action, as per the 'Separation of Privilege' principle, is to minimize the risk of misuse, error, or compromise. By distributing control, no single individual or entity can unilaterally perform a critical action. This acts as a safeguard, ensuring that actions are reviewed or approved by at least one other party, thereby reducing the chances of malicious intent, accidental mistakes, or a single point of failure leading to a security breach."
What does 'completeness' mean for a TCB?,"'Completeness' for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) means that the TCB is **Unbypassable**. This implies that there must be absolutely no way to breach the overall system security by circumventing or bypassing the TCB itself. The TCB must be comprehensive in its security enforcement, ensuring that all security-relevant operations and data flows are mediated and protected by it, leaving no gaps for attackers to exploit."
How does 'unauthorized disclosure' relate to Confidentiality?,"'Unauthorized disclosure' is the direct threat that the security property of **Confidentiality** aims to prevent. Confidentiality is specifically defined as preventing the unauthorized disclosure of information, meaning that sensitive data should not be revealed or made accessible to individuals or entities who lack the necessary permissions. Actions like eavesdropping or illegal copying are examples of unauthorized disclosure that violate confidentiality."
Why is 'Freshness' important for data and communications?,"'Freshness' is important for data and communications because it ensures that the information being used or transmitted is current and has not been reused or replayed. This property protects against replay attacks, where an attacker might capture legitimate, but old, data or communication packets and re-send them to a system to gain unauthorized access, impersonate a legitimate user, or cause unintended actions. By verifying freshness, systems can ensure they are acting upon the most recent and valid information."
What is the primary objective of 'Security Properties'?,"The primary objective of 'Security Properties' is to define the security goals that a system aims to achieve. These properties serve as the fundamental targets for securing a system, outlining what aspects of information and resources need protection and how that protection should be maintained. Examples include Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which collectively describe the desired state of security for a system."
What is the role of 'probing or trial and error' for an attacker with limited knowledge?,"For an attacker with limited knowledge, 'probing or trial and error' serves as their primary method to gain understanding and exploit a system. Since they lack detailed knowledge of the system's design, architecture, or source code, they must rely on systematically testing the system's responses to various inputs (probing) or repeatedly attempting different actions (trial and error) to discover vulnerabilities, identify interaction points, or uncover ways to bypass security controls."
How does 'Tamper-resistant' principle contribute to TCB security?,"The 'Tamper-resistant' principle contributes to Trusted Computing Base (TCB) security by ensuring that the TCB is protected against unauthorized interference from other parts of the system that lie outside its boundary. This means that external components are explicitly prevented from modifying the TCB's code or its operational state. By safeguarding the TCB from alteration, this principle maintains the integrity and reliability of the TCB's security functions, which are critical for the overall security of the system."
What is the significance of an attacker having 'unlimited time' versus needing to 'act quickly'?,"The significance of an attacker having 'unlimited time' versus needing to 'act quickly' lies in the nature and sophistication of the attacks they can mount. An attacker with **unlimited time** can afford to be more patient, stealthy, and persistent, allowing for extensive reconnaissance, development of custom exploits, and slow, undetectable data exfiltration. Conversely, an attacker who needs to **act quickly** might resort to more overt, disruptive, or less sophisticated attacks, such as denial-of-service, or rapid data breaches, as their window of opportunity is limited."
How does 'Verifiability' of TCB relate to its 'correctness'?,"'Verifiability' of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) directly relates to its 'correctness' by ensuring that it is possible to independently confirm that the TCB operates as intended and adheres to its security specifications. This means that the TCB's logic, code, and behavior can be scrutinized and proven to be free from errors or vulnerabilities that could compromise system security. The ability to verify correctness is crucial for establishing trust in the TCB's security mechanisms."
What is the purpose of 'Security Strategies'?,"The purpose of 'Security Strategies' is to provide a structured approach to managing and mitigating security risks within a system. These strategies, which include Prevention, Detection, and Reaction, outline the types of measures and actions that should be taken to protect a system from damage, identify when damage has occurred, and recover from any incidents. They form a comprehensive framework for maintaining the security posture of a system."
How does 'Anonymity or privacy' protect individuals?,"'Anonymity or privacy' protects individuals by ensuring that their personal information and identity are hidden from being leaked to external parties. This security property allows individuals to interact with systems or services without the risk of their sensitive personal data being exposed or compromised. It safeguards personal details, preventing unauthorized collection, use, or disclosure that could lead to identity theft, surveillance, or other privacy violations."
What is the role of 'computing resources' in an attacker's capability?,"The role of 'computing resources' in an attacker's capability refers to the amount of processing power, memory, storage, and network bandwidth an attacker can command. Greater computing resources enable an attacker to perform more intensive tasks, such as faster brute-force attacks to crack passwords, process larger volumes of stolen data, or launch more complex and distributed attacks. It directly impacts the scale, speed, and sophistication of an attacker's operations."
