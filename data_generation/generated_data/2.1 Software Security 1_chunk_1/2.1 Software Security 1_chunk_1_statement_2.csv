What kind of malware would you suspect if your computer is displaying unwanted advertisements?,"If a computer is displaying unwanted advertisements, Adware is the type of malware that would be suspected, as its function is to display unwanted advertisements."
What are the primary factors contributing to software vulnerabilities?,The primary factors contributing to software vulnerabilities are the human factor and the language factor. A vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance.
"Explain the ""Human factor"" as a cause of software vulnerabilities.","The human factor contributes to software vulnerabilities because programs are developed by humans, and humans make mistakes. Additionally, programmers may not be security-aware, and misconfigurations could lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance."
"How does the ""Language factor"" contribute to software vulnerabilities?","The language factor contributes to software vulnerabilities because some programming languages are not designed well for security. This is mainly due to more flexible handling of pointers/references, a lack of strong typing, and manual memory management, which makes it easier for programmers to make mistakes. A vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance."
Provide specific reasons why programming languages can be a source of vulnerabilities.,"Programming languages can be a source of vulnerabilities due to several reasons: more flexible handling of pointers/references, a lack of strong typing, and manual memory management. These characteristics can make it easier for programmers to introduce mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance."
What role does programmer security awareness play in software vulnerabilities?,"Programmer security awareness plays a significant role in software vulnerabilities because if programmers are not security-aware, they are more likely to introduce weaknesses into the software. This lack of awareness is part of the ""human factor"" contributing to vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance."
Describe the memory layout of a program (x86).,"The memory layout of a program (x86) consists of four main sections: Code, Static data, Stack, and Heap. The Code section contains the fixed-size, read-only program code. The Static data section holds statically allocated data like variables and constants. The Stack stores parameters and local variables of methods as they are invoked, with each method invocation creating one frame pushed onto the stack, growing towards lower addresses. The Heap stores dynamically allocated data, such as class instances and data arrays, and grows towards higher addresses."

The Stack is a section of a program's memory layout that stores parameters and local variables of methods and grows towards lower memory addresses."
What is the difference in growth direction between the Stack and the Heap?,"The Stack grows towards lower memory addresses, while the Heap grows towards higher memory addresses. Both are fundamental sections of a program's memory layout."
"Can the program code in the ""Code"" section be modified during runtime?","No, the program code in the ""Code"" section is fixed in size and read-only, meaning it cannot be modified during runtime. The Code section is a part of a program's memory layout."
Where are local variables of methods stored in memory?,Local variables of methods are stored on the Stack as part of the frames created when methods are invoked. The Stack is a section of a program's memory layout that stores parameters and local variables of methods and grows towards lower memory addresses.
Where are dynamically allocated data structures like class instances stored?,"Dynamically allocated data structures, such as class instances and data arrays, are stored in the Heap section of memory. The Heap is a section of a program's memory layout that stores dynamically allocated data and grows towards higher memory addresses."
"What are the characteristics of the ""Code"" section of memory?","The ""Code"" section of memory contains the program code, which is characterized by being fixed in size and read-only. It is one of the main sections in a program's memory layout."
