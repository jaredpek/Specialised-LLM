Compare the two primary focuses of security assessment for biometric user identification systems according to Matsumoto.,"Matsumoto states that security assessment of biometric user identification systems should be conducted not only for accuracy of authentication but also for security against fraud. Accuracy of authentication refers to the system's ability to correctly verify a user's identity. Security against fraud, on the other hand, pertains to the system's resilience against deceptive attempts to bypass it, such as using fake biometrics."
What are the differences between protecting biometric information against abuse and preventing fake biometrics in biometric systems?,"Biometric systems must protect the information for biometrics against abuse, meaning they must safeguard the stored biometric data from unauthorized access or misuse. Concurrently, they must also prevent fake biometrics, which involves mechanisms to detect and reject artificial or spoofed biometric samples, such as cloned fingerprints, presented to the system for identification."
Distinguish between making fingerprint moulds by pressing live fingers and by processing fingerprint images from prints on glass surfaces.,"Moulds for cloning fingerprints can be made by pressing live fingers against a material to create an impression. Alternatively, they can be made by processing fingerprint images obtained from prints on glass surfaces. Both methods are used to create moulds that enable the production of fake biometrics, such as gummy or conductive silicone fingers, capable of fooling fingerprint devices."
Compare the method of making fingerprint moulds from prints on glass surfaces with the method using impressions of inked fingers.,"Fingerprint moulds can be made by processing fingerprint images from prints on glass surfaces. Another method involves processing impressions of inked fingers. Both techniques are described as ways to create moulds that can then be used to produce fake biometrics, like gummy or conductive silicone fingers, which can fool fingerprint devices."
What are the differences between gummy fingers and conductive silicone fingers in the context of fooling fingerprint devices?,"Gummy fingers and conductive silicone fingers are both types of fake biometrics that are made with moulds. These fake fingers are described as being capable of fooling fingerprint devices. The document highlights them as two distinct materials used for creating these spoofing devices, without detailing specific functional differences between the 'gummy' and 'conductive silicone' properties in fooling devices."
Compare the effectiveness of a single authentication technique versus combining various authentication techniques.,"Combining various authentication techniques is more effective than using a single authentication technique alone. A single authentication technique relies on one method for user verification. In contrast, combining techniques, such as biometric authentication with a password or a token, enhances the authentication process, making it more robust and secure."
What are the disadvantages of using biometric authentication alone compared to combining it with other techniques?,"The document discusses some disadvantages of using biometric authentication alone. However, if biometric authentication is combined with another technique, such as a password or a token, the authentication process becomes more effective. This implies that relying solely on biometrics may have vulnerabilities that can be mitigated by incorporating additional, independent authentication factors."
Compare two-factor authentication (2FA) with a single authentication method.,"Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a case where a user is authenticated based upon two independent methods, making the process more effective. A single authentication method, by contrast, relies on only one technique for verification, which is described as less effective than combining multiple techniques. An ATM card transaction, requiring both the card and a PIN, is an example of 2FA."
What are the differences between 'something the user has' and 'something the user knows' in the context of two-factor authentication?,"In two-factor authentication (2FA), 'something the user has' refers to a physical item possessed by the user, such as an ATM card. 'Something the user knows' refers to information that only the user is aware of, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN), which functions like a password. For 2FA, both types of factors are required for authentication, providing two independent methods of verification."
Compare the role of an ATM card with a PIN in an ATM transaction as an example of two-factor authentication.,"In an ATM transaction, the ATM card serves as 'something that the user has,' representing a physical token of authentication. The PIN, or Personal Identification Number, which can be thought of as a password, serves as 'something that the user knows.' For authentication, the user is required to enter both the card into the teller machine and the PIN, demonstrating the use of two independent methods for two-factor authentication."
What are the differences between the information stored on an ATM card's magnetic stripe and a PIN?,"ATM cards have magnetic stripes that contain the user's name and account number. When the card is used, the user is required to enter not only the card but also a PIN. The PIN, which can be thought of as a password, is a piece of information the user knows, distinct from the data physically stored on the card's magnetic stripe. Both are used together for authentication in a two-factor system."
Compare traditional authentication factors with location as an additional factor in authentication.,"Traditional authentication factors typically involve things like an ATM card (something the user has) and a PIN (something the user knows). However, other factors, such as Alice's location, can be taken into account when conducting authentication. Location, determined by a cellphone's GPS chip and verified by a cellphone company's computer system, can serve as an additional, independent method to enhance security, especially against fraudulent withdrawal requests."
What are the differences between a GPS chip in a cellphone and a cellphone company's computer system in determining a user's location for authentication?,"A cellphone that has a GPS chip inside of it can determine Alice's location. When Alice stands in front of an ATM requesting to withdraw money, Alice's bank could ask her cellphone company's computer system where she currently is. The GPS chip is the hardware component that acquires location data, while the cellphone company's computer system is the entity that processes and responds with the latitude and longitude corresponding to the cellphone's expected location, which the bank then uses for verification."
Compare an authentication process relying solely on an ATM card and PIN with one that also incorporates location.,"An authentication process relying solely on an ATM card and PIN requires the user to provide 'something they have' (the card) and 'something they know' (the PIN). While this is a form of two-factor authentication, it can be compromised if both are stolen. However, if Alice's ATM card and PIN were stolen by a bad guy trying to withdraw money, then taking Alice's location (or specifically, the location of her cell phone) into account could help thwart such a fraudulent withdrawal request, adding an extra layer of security."
What are the differences between protecting biometric data from abuse and preventing the creation of fake biometrics?,"Protecting biometric data from abuse involves securing the stored templates or raw biometric information from unauthorized access, modification, or leakage. This is about data integrity and confidentiality. Preventing the creation of fake biometrics, on the other hand, refers to the methods and technologies used to make it difficult or impossible for attackers to fabricate artificial biometric samples (like cloned fingerprints) that can fool the system's sensors. This is about input integrity."
Compare the security implications of assessing biometric systems only for accuracy versus also for security against fraud.,"Assessing biometric systems only for accuracy of authentication would focus solely on how well the system correctly identifies legitimate users and rejects imposters under normal conditions. However, Matsumoto emphasizes that assessment must also include security against fraud, which addresses the system's vulnerability to sophisticated attacks like spoofing with fake biometrics. Neglecting fraud assessment leaves systems open to bypass, even if they are highly accurate with genuine inputs."
Distinguish between the 'moulds' and the 'gummy fingers' or 'conductive silicone fingers' in fingerprint cloning.,"The 'moulds' are the intermediate forms created by pressing live fingers or processing fingerprint images/impressions. They serve as templates. The 'gummy fingers' and 'conductive silicone fingers' are the actual fake biometrics, the final products, which are made *with* these moulds. These fake fingers are what are presented to the fingerprint devices to fool them, whereas the moulds are the tools used in their creation."
Compare the effectiveness of biometric authentication alone versus biometric authentication combined with a password.,"Biometric authentication alone, while convenient, has discussed disadvantages. However, if biometric authentication is combined with a password, the authentication process becomes more effective. A password, being 'something the user knows,' adds an independent layer of security, mitigating vulnerabilities that might exist when relying solely on biometric traits."
What are the differences between a password and a token as additional authentication techniques combined with biometrics?,"When combining biometric authentication with another technique, a password is a piece of secret information that the user knows. A token, by contrast, is a physical or digital object that the user possesses. Both a password and a token serve as independent authentication factors that, when combined with biometrics, make the overall authentication process more effective."
Compare the security provided by an ATM card and PIN alone with the security enhanced by adding location verification.,"Security provided by an ATM card and PIN alone relies on 'something the user has' and 'something the user knows.' While this is a form of two-factor authentication, it can be compromised if both are stolen. Security enhanced by adding location verification, such as checking the cellphone's location against the ATM's location, provides an additional, independent factor. This extra layer can help thwart fraudulent withdrawal requests even if the card and PIN are stolen, by verifying the user's presence at the transaction location."
What are the differences between the user's name and account number found on an ATM card's magnetic stripe?,ATM cards have magnetic stripes that contain both the user's name and account number. The user's name serves to identify the cardholder personally. The account number is the specific identifier for the financial account linked to the card. Both pieces of information are stored on the magnetic stripe and are necessary for the card's functionality in a teller machine.
Compare the initial source material for creating fingerprint moulds: live fingers versus processed images/impressions.,"The initial source material for creating fingerprint moulds can be live fingers, which are directly pressed to form a mould. Alternatively, the source can be processed images from prints on glass surfaces or processed impressions of inked fingers. Both approaches lead to the creation of moulds that are then used to produce fake biometrics capable of fooling fingerprint devices."
What are the differences between the threat of 'abuse' of biometric information and the general 'disadvantages of using biometric authentication alone'?,"The 'abuse' of biometric information refers to specific malicious actions like unauthorized access or misuse of stored biometric data. The 'disadvantages of using biometric authentication alone' is a broader concept encompassing various weaknesses when only biometrics are used, which could include susceptibility to spoofing (fake biometrics) or the potential for abuse of the stored data if not properly secured. While abuse is a specific threat, the disadvantages are a wider category of vulnerabilities."
Compare the role of a user's physical presence at an ATM with their cellphone's reported location in authentication.,"When Alice stands in front of an ATM requesting to withdraw money, her physical presence at the ATM is a given. Her cellphone's reported location, obtained via its GPS chip and confirmed by her cellphone company's computer system, provides an independent verification of her location. If the cellphone's reported location corresponds to the expected ATM location, it corroborates her physical presence and helps approve the withdrawal request, especially in preventing fraud."
What are the differences between a PIN and a password in the context of authentication methods?,"A PIN, or Personal Identification Number, can basically be thought of as a password. Both are forms of 'something the user knows,' which means they are secret pieces of information known only to the user and used for authentication. The document uses 'PIN' specifically in the context of ATM card usage, where it acts as a password for accessing funds, implying they are functionally similar in verifying user knowledge."
Compare the security assessment of biometric systems for 'accuracy of authentication' with the broader concept of 'security against fraud'.,"Assessing biometric systems for 'accuracy of authentication' focuses on their performance in correctly identifying legitimate users and rejecting imposters under ideal or expected conditions. The broader concept of 'security against fraud,' however, is a more comprehensive objective that encompasses accuracy but also critically evaluates the system's resilience against deliberate attempts to bypass it using deceptive methods, such as cloned fingerprints. Matsumoto emphasizes that both aspects are crucial for a complete security assessment."
What are the differences between the two methods of making fingerprint moulds that involve processing images or impressions?,One method of making fingerprint moulds involves processing fingerprint images from prints on glass surfaces. The other method involves processing impressions of inked fingers. Both require a processing step to convert the visual or impressed data into a mould. The distinction lies in the initial form of the print: a latent print on glass versus a visible print made with ink.
Compare the security concerns related to the 'information for biometrics' with the concerns related to 'fake biometrics'.,"Security concerns related to the 'information for biometrics' focus on protecting the stored biometric data itself from abuse, such as unauthorized access or misuse. Security concerns related to 'fake biometrics' focus on preventing the creation and successful use of artificial biometric samples, like cloned fingerprints, to spoof the system. One deals with data at rest, the other with data at input."
What are the differences between the 'moulds' and the 'fake biometrics' they produce?,"The 'moulds' are the templates created from genuine fingerprints, serving as the intermediate step in the cloning process. They are used to shape the final product. The 'fake biometrics,' such as gummy fingers or conductive silicone fingers, are the actual artificial replicas produced *from* these moulds. These fake biometrics are the items directly presented to fingerprint devices to fool them, whereas the moulds are the tools for their creation."
Compare the general concept of 'authentication' with 'two-factor authentication (2FA)'.,"Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a specific, more robust form of authentication where a user is authenticated based upon two independent methods. The document implies that general authentication can be a single technique, which is less effective than 2FA, which combines two distinct factors to enhance security."
What are the differences between a password and a PIN in their application for authentication?,"A PIN, or Personal Identification Number, can basically be thought of as a password. Both are secret pieces of information that the user knows and are used for authentication. The document specifically mentions a PIN in the context of an ATM card, where it is entered into a teller machine. While functionally similar as 'something the user knows,' their typical application contexts might differ, with PINs often associated with physical cards or devices."
Compare the security of an ATM transaction without location verification versus with location verification.,"An ATM transaction without location verification relies solely on the ATM card and PIN. If these are stolen, a fraudulent withdrawal can occur. With location verification, the bank can check the user's cellphone location against the ATM's location. If they correspond, it adds an extra layer of security, helping to thwart fraudulent withdrawal requests even if the card and PIN have been compromised, by ensuring the legitimate user's presence."
What are the differences between the information on an ATM card's magnetic stripe and the user's name?,"An ATM card's magnetic stripe contains the user's name and account number. The user's name is a specific piece of identifying information stored on the magnetic stripe. The magnetic stripe itself is the physical component of the card that holds this data, along with the account number, for use in a teller machine."
Compare the process of making fingerprint moulds by pressing live fingers with the objective of creating fake biometrics.,"The process of making fingerprint moulds by pressing live fingers is a specific technique for creating a template. This is a foundational step. The objective of creating fake biometrics, such as gummy or conductive silicone fingers, is the ultimate goal, which is achieved *after* the mould is made. These fake biometrics are then used to fool fingerprint devices, demonstrating the progression from mould creation to spoofing."
What are the differences between the security assessment of biometric systems for 'accuracy' and for 'fraud'?,"Security assessment for 'accuracy' in biometric systems evaluates how well the system performs its primary function of correctly authenticating legitimate users and rejecting unauthorized ones. Security assessment for 'fraud' specifically evaluates the system's vulnerability to sophisticated attacks, such as the use of fake biometrics to bypass the system. Matsumoto stresses that both are essential for a complete assessment."
Compare the general concept of 'abuse' of biometric information with the specific act of 'preventing fake biometrics'.,"The general concept of 'abuse' of biometric information refers to any unauthorized or improper use of stored biometric data. The specific act of 'preventing fake biometrics' is a measure taken to counter a particular type of abuse, namely, the creation and presentation of artificial biometric samples to trick the system. While related, one is a broad category of misuse, and the other is a targeted defense against a specific attack vector."
What are the differences between the two types of fake fingers mentioned: 'gummy' and 'conductive silicone'?,"The document mentions 'gummy fingers' and 'conductive silicone fingers' as two types of fake biometrics made with moulds that can fool fingerprint devices. While both serve the purpose of spoofing, their names suggest different material properties. 'Gummy' implies a soft, pliable texture, while 'conductive silicone' implies a material that can conduct electricity, potentially relevant for certain types of fingerprint sensors, though the document does not elaborate on these specific material differences beyond their names."
Compare the role of a password with the role of a token when combined with biometric authentication.,"When combined with biometric authentication, a password serves as a 'something the user knows' factor, requiring the user to recall a secret piece of information. A token, on the other hand, serves as a 'something the user has' factor, requiring the user to possess a physical or digital item. Both are independent methods that enhance the effectiveness of the authentication process when used alongside biometrics."
What are the differences between the user's name and account number as pieces of information on an ATM card?,"The user's name on an ATM card identifies the individual cardholder. The account number identifies the specific financial account associated with that card. Both are distinct pieces of information stored on the magnetic stripe of the ATM card, essential for linking the card to the correct person and their funds during a transaction."
Compare the security of using only an ATM card and PIN with the enhanced security provided by adding Alice's cell phone location.,"Using only an ATM card and PIN provides a basic level of two-factor authentication, relying on 'something the user has' and 'something the user knows.' However, if these are stolen, fraud is possible. Adding Alice's cell phone location provides enhanced security by introducing a third, independent factor ('somewhere the user is'). This allows the bank to verify if the card and PIN are being used at the expected location, thereby helping to thwart fraudulent withdrawal requests."
What are the differences between the 'moulds' and the 'devices' that are fooled by fake fingerprints?,"The 'moulds' are the templates created from genuine fingerprints, used to produce fake biometrics. The 'devices' are the fingerprint devices themselves, which are the target of the spoofing attack. The moulds are a tool in the creation process, while the devices are the legitimate security mechanisms that the fake biometrics are designed to bypass."
Compare the concept of 'authentication' with the specific example of 'ATM cards' as a form of authentication.,"Authentication is the general process of verifying a user's identity. ATM cards represent a specific example of authentication, particularly two-factor authentication. When an ATM card is used, it requires both the card itself ('something the user has') and a PIN ('something the user knows') to authenticate the user, illustrating a practical application of combined authentication techniques."
What are the differences between the information stored on an ATM card's magnetic stripe and the card itself?,"The ATM card itself is the physical object, which serves as a 'something the user has' factor in authentication. The information stored on its magnetic stripe, such as the user's name and account number, is the data encoded onto that physical object. The card is the carrier, and the information is the content, both essential for its function."
Compare the process of entering an ATM card into a teller machine with entering a PIN.,"Entering an ATM card into a teller machine is the physical act of presenting the 'something the user has' factor. Entering a PIN is the act of providing the 'something the user knows' factor. Both actions are required for authentication during an ATM transaction, demonstrating the two independent methods of verification in two-factor authentication."
What are the differences between the 'accuracy of authentication' and the 'effectiveness' of the authentication process?,"Accuracy of authentication refers to how correctly a biometric system verifies a user's identity. The 'effectiveness' of the authentication process is a broader term, which can be enhanced by combining various authentication techniques. While accuracy is a component, effectiveness also considers factors like security against fraud and the overall robustness achieved by using multiple, independent methods, making the process more difficult to bypass."
Compare the security assessment of biometric systems for 'accuracy' with the overall security posture against 'fraud'.,"Security assessment for 'accuracy' focuses on the system's ability to correctly match genuine biometric inputs. The overall security posture against 'fraud' encompasses this accuracy but extends to the system's resilience against deliberate attempts to deceive it, such as using fake biometrics. Matsumoto emphasizes that a complete assessment must consider both, as a system can be accurate with genuine inputs but vulnerable to fraud."
What are the differences between the 'abuse' of biometric information and the 'fraudulent withdrawal request' mentioned?,"The 'abuse' of biometric information refers to the misuse or unauthorized handling of stored biometric data. A 'fraudulent withdrawal request' is a specific type of malicious action, where an unauthorized individual attempts to withdraw money, potentially using stolen credentials like an ATM card and PIN. While abuse is a general threat to biometric data, a fraudulent withdrawal request is a concrete example of a financial crime that authentication systems, including those using biometrics and location, aim to prevent."
Compare the role of the ATM card as 'something the user has' with the PIN as 'something the user knows' in preventing fraud.,"The ATM card, as 'something the user has,' provides a physical barrier to unauthorized access. The PIN, as 'something the user knows,' provides a knowledge-based barrier. In combination, they form a two-factor authentication system. If both are stolen, fraud is still possible. However, the combination makes it harder than if only one factor were used, and adding location verification further strengthens fraud prevention."
What are the differences between the 'expected location of the ATM' and 'Alice's current location' in the context of fraud prevention?,"The 'expected location of the ATM' is the fixed geographical position of the Automated Teller Machine where a transaction is initiated. 'Alice's current location' refers to the real-time geographical position of Alice's cellphone, as reported by her cellphone company's computer system. For fraud prevention, the bank compares these two locations. If Alice's current location does not correspond to the expected ATM location, it signals a potential fraudulent activity, even if the ATM card and PIN are correct."
Compare the general concept of 'authentication techniques' with the specific examples of 'password' and 'token'.,"Authentication techniques are the various methods used to verify a user's identity. A 'password' and a 'token' are specific examples of such techniques. A password is a knowledge-based technique ('something the user knows'), while a token is a possession-based technique ('something the user has'). The document suggests combining these specific techniques, along with biometrics, to make the overall authentication process more effective."
What are the differences between the security assessment of biometric systems for 'accuracy' and the overall 'security' of the system?,"The security assessment of biometric systems for 'accuracy' focuses on the system's performance in correctly identifying users. The overall 'security' of the system is a broader concept that encompasses accuracy but also critically includes 'security against fraud.' Matsumoto emphasizes that a complete security assessment must consider both, as a system can be accurate but still insecure if it is vulnerable to fraud through fake biometrics."
Compare the role of the 'magnetic stripe' on an ATM card with the 'PIN' in securing a transaction.,"The 'magnetic stripe' on an ATM card physically stores identifying information like the user's name and account number, making the card itself a 'something the user has' factor. The 'PIN' is a secret code known only to the user, acting as a 'something the user knows' factor. Both are required for an ATM transaction, with the magnetic stripe providing the card's data and the PIN verifying the user's knowledge, together forming a two-factor authentication mechanism."
What are the differences between the 'disadvantages of using biometric authentication alone' and the 'effectiveness' of combined authentication?,"The 'disadvantages of using biometric authentication alone' refer to the inherent weaknesses or vulnerabilities when only a single biometric factor is used for verification. The 'effectiveness' of combined authentication, conversely, refers to the enhanced security and robustness achieved when multiple, independent authentication techniques (like biometrics with a password or token) are used together. The document states that combining techniques makes the process 'more effective' than using biometrics alone, directly addressing these differences."
Compare the concept of 'user identification systems' with 'biometric user identification systems'.,"User identification systems are general systems designed to verify a user's identity. 'Biometric user identification systems' are a specific type of user identification system that relies on unique biological or behavioral characteristics (biometrics) for verification. The document focuses on the security assessment of these biometric systems, highlighting their unique challenges like security against fraud and the need to prevent fake biometrics."
What are the differences between the 'moulds' used for cloning and the 'fingerprint devices' that are fooled?,"The 'moulds' are intermediate tools created from genuine fingerprints, used to fabricate fake biometrics. The 'fingerprint devices' are the authentication systems that are the target of the spoofing attack. The moulds are part of the attacker's toolkit, while the fingerprint devices are the legitimate security mechanisms that the fake biometrics are designed to bypass."
Compare the security assessment of biometric systems for 'accuracy' versus for their ability to 'prevent fake biometrics'.,"Security assessment for 'accuracy' evaluates how well a biometric system correctly identifies legitimate users and rejects imposters. Assessment for its ability to 'prevent fake biometrics' specifically evaluates the system's robustness against spoofing attacks, where artificial biometric samples are presented. Matsumoto emphasizes that both are crucial, as a system can be accurate with real biometrics but fail if it cannot detect fake ones."
What are the differences between the 'information for biometrics' and 'fake biometrics' in terms of system protection?,"Biometric systems must protect the 'information for biometrics' against abuse, which refers to safeguarding the stored biometric data itself. They must also prevent 'fake biometrics,' which refers to detecting and rejecting artificial biometric samples presented for authentication. One concerns the security of stored data, while the other concerns the integrity of the input during an authentication attempt."
Compare the general concept of 'authentication' with the specific example of 'Alice's location' as an authentication factor.,"Authentication is the general process of verifying a user's identity. 'Alice's location' is a specific, additional factor that can be taken into account during authentication. While traditional authentication might rely on 'something Alice has' (like an ATM card) and 'something Alice knows' (like a PIN), her location provides an independent 'somewhere Alice is' factor, enhancing security, particularly against fraudulent withdrawal requests."
What are the differences between the 'magnetic stripe' and the 'ATM card' itself in terms of authentication components?,"The 'ATM card' is the physical object that a user possesses, serving as a 'something the user has' factor. The 'magnetic stripe' is a component *on* the ATM card that stores specific data, such as the user's name and account number. While the card is the overall physical token, the magnetic stripe is the part that carries the machine-readable data essential for the card's function in a teller machine."
Compare the security implications of a stolen ATM card and PIN alone versus when location verification is also considered.,"If an ATM card and PIN are stolen, a fraudulent withdrawal request can be made, as the two primary authentication factors are compromised. However, if location verification is also considered, the bank can check if the cellphone's location corresponds to the ATM's location. If it doesn't, the fraudulent request can be thwarted, demonstrating that location adds a critical layer of security beyond just the card and PIN."
What are the differences between the 'user's name' and the 'PIN' in an ATM card transaction?,"The 'user's name' is identifying information stored on the ATM card's magnetic stripe. The 'PIN' (Personal Identification Number) is a secret code known only to the user, functioning as a password. The user's name helps identify the cardholder, while the PIN verifies the user's knowledge. Both are distinct pieces of information used in the two-factor authentication process for an ATM transaction."
Compare the methods of making fingerprint moulds using 'live fingers' versus using 'inked fingers'.,"Moulds for cloning fingerprints can be made by pressing 'live fingers' against a material. Alternatively, they can be made by processing the 'impression of inked fingers'. Both methods aim to capture the fingerprint pattern to create a mould. The distinction lies in whether the finger is directly pressed or if an inked impression is used as the source material for processing."
What are the differences between the 'accuracy of authentication' and the 'security against fraud' as distinct assessment criteria?,"Accuracy of authentication is a criterion that measures how precisely a biometric system performs its intended function of verifying identity. Security against fraud is a distinct criterion that measures the system's resilience against malicious attempts to bypass it using deceptive means, such as fake biometrics. Matsumoto emphasizes that both criteria are independently crucial for a comprehensive security assessment of biometric user identification systems."
