Unauthorized access, modification, or misuse of biometric information could lead to severe security breaches, identity theft, or fraudulent activities that are difficult to reverse, as biometric data is typically immutable.\n\n*   **Biometric systems:** Technologies that use unique biological characteristics for identification.\n*   **Biometric information:** Data representing a person's unique biological traits.\n*   **Abuse:** Unauthorized or improper use.\n*   **Security breaches:** Incidents where security measures are circumvented.\n*   **Identity theft:** The fraudulent appropriation and use of another person's identity."
What is the role of 'prints on glass surfaces' in fingerprint cloning?,"Prints on glass surfaces play a role in fingerprint cloning as a source for obtaining fingerprint images. These images can then be processed to create moulds, which are subsequently used to make artificial fingers capable of fooling fingerprint devices.\n\n*   **Prints on glass surfaces:** Latent or visible fingerprint marks left on glass.\n*   **Fingerprint cloning:** The process of creating artificial replicas of fingerprints.\n*   **Fingerprint images:** Digital or physical representations of fingerprint patterns.\n*   **Moulds:** Templates used to create artificial fingers."
How does the concept of 'something that the user knows' differ from 'something that the user has' in authentication?,"The concept of 'something that the user knows' (like a password or PIN) differs from 'something that the user has' (like an ATM card or token) in authentication by the nature of the factor. 'Knows' relies on cognitive memory of a secret, while 'has' relies on physical possession of an item. Both are independent factors that, when combined, enhance security by requiring different types of credentials.\n\n*   **'Something that the user knows':** An authentication factor based on secret knowledge (e.g., password, PIN).\n*   **'Something that the user has':** An authentication factor based on physical possession (e.g., card, token).\n*   **Authentication:** The process of verifying identity.\n*   **Independent factors:** Authentication methods that are distinct and do not rely on each other."
