Analyze the scope of security assessment for biometric user identification systems.,The security assessment of biometric user identification systems should be conducted not only for the accuracy of authentication but also for security against fraud.\n\n*Definition: Biometric user identification systems are technologies that verify an individual's identity based on unique biological characteristics. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or process. Fraud refers to wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.*
What are the primary responsibilities of biometric systems regarding information protection?,"Biometric systems must protect the information for biometrics against abuse, and they must also prevent fake biometrics.\n\n*Definition: Biometric systems are security systems that use unique biological characteristics for identification. Biometrics refers to unique physical or behavioral characteristics used for identification and authentication. Abuse, in this context, refers to the misuse or unauthorized access/manipulation of sensitive information. Fake biometrics are artificial or replicated biometric data used to bypass security systems.*"
