What are the primary security challenges faced by modern operating systems?,"Modern operating systems face several security challenges, evolving from simpler systems. These include the transition from single-user to multi-user environments, the shift from trusted applications to untrusted applications, and the change from standalone systems to networked systems."
Explain the security implications of the transition from single-user to multi-user operating systems.,"The transition from single-user to multi-user operating systems introduces a significant security challenge because not all users are trusted. In multi-user systems, such as MacOS, Linux, NT-based Windows, and cloud computing environments, multiple users can run on the same system, often without knowing each other. This necessitates robust mechanisms to isolate users and prevent unauthorized access or interference. A single-user operating system (OS), like DOS, does not face this particular challenge as only one user operates it."
How do modern PCs and smartphones present a security challenge regarding applications compared to simple real-time systems?,"Modern PCs and smartphones present a security challenge because they run applications from third-party developers, meaning not all applications are trusted. In contrast, simple real-time systems typically only run one specific application from trusted sources, which inherently reduces the risk of malicious software."
What security threats do standalone computer systems primarily need to protect against?,"Isolated computer systems, also known as standalone systems, primarily need to protect against physical threats. These systems are not connected to networks, so their vulnerabilities are typically localized to their physical environment."
How do security concerns change when a computer system transitions from a standalone to a networked system?,"When a computer system transitions from a standalone system to a networked system, the security concerns expand significantly. Once connected to networks, the system faces external unknown threats, as not all network components are trusted. This requires protection beyond just physical threats, encompassing network-based attacks and vulnerabilities."
What is the primary responsibility of an Operating System in terms of security protection?,The primary responsibility of an Operating System (OS) in terms of security protection is to protect the applications and resources inside it. The OS achieves this by controlling what users and processes are allowed to do and preventing what they are not allowed to do.
List the main security protection stages within an Operating System.,"The main security protection stages within an Operating System (OS) are Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing."
What is Authentication in the context of Operating System security?,"Authentication is the first stage of security protection in an Operating System (OS) where the system verifies the identity of a user or process. It is the process by which a computer determines if a user is legitimate, typically by requiring ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" or ""something you are."""
What is Authorization with Access Control in OS security?,"Authorization with Access Control is a security protection stage in an Operating System (OS) that determines what authenticated users or processes are permitted to do. Access Control refers to the mechanisms that enforce these permissions, ensuring that users and processes can only access resources and perform actions for which they have been granted explicit rights."
"Explain the purpose of Logging, Monitoring & Auditing in Operating System security.","Logging, Monitoring & Auditing is a security protection stage in an Operating System (OS) that involves recording system activities, observing system behavior for anomalies, and reviewing logs to ensure security policies are being followed and to detect potential breaches.\n- **Logging** is the process of recording events that occur within the OS.\n- **Monitoring** involves continuously observing the system for suspicious activities or deviations from normal behavior.\n- **Auditing** is the systematic examination of logs and system records to verify compliance with security policies and to investigate security incidents."
How does a computer determine if a user is a correct or legitimate user?,"A computer determines if a user is a correct or legitimate user through authentication, which involves verifying their identity based on three main factors: ""something you know,"" ""something you have,"" or ""something you are."""
What are the three main factors used for user authentication?,"The three main factors used for user authentication are:\n1.  **Knowledge Factor**: Something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN, public/private keys).\n2.  **Possession Factor**: Something the user has (e.g., smartcard, hardware tokens).\n3.  **Inherence Factor**: Something the user is (e.g., biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition)."
"Define the ""Knowledge Factor"" in authentication and provide examples.","The ""Knowledge Factor"" in authentication refers to something that only the legitimate user knows. Examples include a password, a Personal Identification Number (PIN), or public/private keys. A **password** is a secret word or phrase used for authentication, while a **PIN** is a numerical code used for the same purpose. A **security question** is another form of knowledge factor, requiring the user to recall specific information."
"Define the ""Possession Factor"" in authentication and provide examples.","The ""Possession Factor"" in authentication refers to something that only the legitimate user has. Examples include a smartphone, a smartcard, or hardware tokens. A **smartcard** is a plastic card with an embedded microchip that can store and process data, used for authentication. A **hardware token** is a physical device that generates a one-time password or cryptographic challenge for authentication."
"Define the ""Inherence Factor"" in authentication and provide examples.","The ""Inherence Factor"" in authentication refers to something that is inherent to the legitimate user's physical self. Examples include biometrics such as fingerprints, retina patterns, or characteristics used for face recognition and voice recognition. **Biometrics** are unique biological characteristics that can be used to identify individuals. A **fingerprint** is an impression of the friction ridges of all or any part of the finger, used for biometric authentication. A **retina pattern** is the unique arrangement of blood vessels on the retina, also used for biometric authentication. **Face recognition** is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame by comparing selected facial features from the image with faces in a database."
What is a password and why is it a common authentication method?,"A password is a secret string of characters, typically a word or phrase, that a user knows and provides to prove their identity. It is the most common way to prove who you are because it has been widely adopted by various networking websites and applications due to its simplicity and ease of implementation."
What determines the security of a password-based authentication mechanism?,"The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password. A strong password makes it difficult for an attacker to guess the password, thereby enhancing the security of the authentication process."
Describe the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize, which makes it convenient for users, but it is also easy to be guessed by attackers. Conversely, a complex password is strong and difficult to guess, offering better security, but it often results in frustrated users because it is harder to remember and type."
What is a weak password?,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These passwords lack complexity and often rely on predictable patterns or personal information."
Provide examples of characteristics that make a password weak.,"Characteristics that make a password weak include:\n1.  **Short passwords**: A single word or numerical phrase (e.g., ""password"", ""12345"").\n2.  **Recognizable keystroke patterns**: Sequences that are easy to find on a keyboard (e.g., ""QWERTY"").\n3.  **Personal information**: Details like date of birth, address, or name.\n4.  **Repeated letters or numbers**: Simple repetitions (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"")."
"What are ""short passwords"" in the context of weak passwords?","In the context of weak passwords, ""short passwords"" refer to character combinations that are brief and often consist of a single word or a simple numerical phrase, such as ""password"" or ""12345"". These are considered weak because they are easy to guess."
How do recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to weak passwords because they are sequences of characters that are physically close on a keyboard and thus easy to type and guess. An example is ""QWERTY,"" which is the top row of letters on many keyboards."
Why is using personal information in passwords considered a security risk?,"Using personal information in passwords, such as a date of birth, address, or name, is considered a security risk because this information is often publicly available or easily discoverable by attackers. This makes it much easier for them to guess the password, compromising security."
Why are passwords with repeated letters or numbers considered weak?,"Passwords with repeated letters or numbers, such as ""55555"" or ""aaaa,"" are considered weak because they are simple, predictable patterns that are easy for attackers to guess or for password-cracking software to identify quickly."
What are some of the most popular weak passwords according to the provided data?,"According to the provided data on password popularity, some of the most popular weak passwords include ""123456,"" ""12345,"" ""123456789,"" ""Password,"" ""iloveyou,"" ""princess,"" ""rockyou,"" ""1234567,"" ""12345678,"" and ""abc123."""
What is the role of an Operating System in controlling user and process actions?,"An Operating System (OS) controls what users and processes can do by enforcing security policies and permissions. It prevents unauthorized actions, ensuring that users and processes only interact with resources and applications for which they have explicit authorization."
How does cloud computing introduce security challenges in multi-user environments?,"Cloud computing introduces security challenges in multi-user environments by allowing multiple users from all over the world to run on the same system, often without knowing each other. This increases the attack surface and the complexity of ensuring that ""not all users are trusted,"" requiring robust isolation and access control mechanisms."
"What is the significance of ""Not all users are trusted!"" in the context of multi-user OS security?","The statement ""Not all users are trusted!"" signifies a fundamental security principle in multi-user Operating Systems. It highlights the necessity for the OS to implement strong authentication, authorization, and isolation mechanisms to prevent malicious or accidental harm from one user to another, or to the system's integrity, even if they are legitimate users of the system."
"What is the significance of ""Not all apps are trusted!"" in the context of modern OS security?","The statement ""Not all apps are trusted!"" is significant in modern Operating System security because modern PCs and smartphones run applications from third-party developers. This means the OS cannot assume that every application is benign, necessitating mechanisms like sandboxing, permission models, and application vetting to mitigate risks from potentially malicious or vulnerable software."
"What is the significance of ""Not all network components are trusted!"" in the context of networked systems security?","The statement ""Not all network components are trusted!"" is significant in the context of networked systems security because once a system is connected to a network, it faces external and unknown threats. This implies that any device or service on the network, including routers, servers, or other connected computers, could be a source of attack or vulnerability, requiring the system to implement network security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection, and secure communication protocols."
"What is ""Privilege Management in OS"" as outlined in the security topics?","""Privilege Management in OS"" is identified as a key area within Operating System security, as outlined in the document. While the document lists it as a topic, it does not provide further details on its definition or implementation."
How does Authentication relate to Authorization in the OS security protection stages?,"Authentication is the prerequisite stage for Authorization in Operating System (OS) security. First, Authentication verifies the identity of a user or process. Once authenticated, Authorization with Access Control then determines what specific actions that now-identified user or process is permitted to perform on the system's resources."
Can an unauthenticated user gain access to resources in an OS with proper security protection?,"No, an unauthenticated user cannot gain access to resources in an Operating System (OS) with proper security protection. Authentication is the initial stage that verifies identity, and only after successful authentication can Authorization determine what resources and actions a user or process is permitted to access."
What is the purpose of public/private keys as an authentication factor?,"Public/private keys serve as a ""Knowledge Factor"" in authentication. They are cryptographic keys that a user knows (or possesses in a secure manner) to prove their identity. The private key is kept secret by the user, while the public key can be shared and used to verify the user's identity or encrypt data that only the private key holder can decrypt."
"How does a smartcard function as a ""Possession Factor"" for authentication?","A smartcard functions as a ""Possession Factor"" for authentication because it is a physical item that the legitimate user has. It typically contains an embedded microchip that stores user credentials or cryptographic keys, which are then used by the system to verify the user's identity when the smartcard is presented."
What is a hardware token in the context of authentication?,"A hardware token is a physical device that serves as a ""Possession Factor"" for authentication. It is something the user has, and it typically generates a one-time password or a cryptographic challenge-response, which is then used in conjunction with a username or password to verify the user's identity."
What is biometrics in the context of authentication?,"Biometrics refers to the use of unique biological characteristics of an individual for authentication, falling under the ""Inherence Factor."" Examples include fingerprints, retina patterns, and facial features used for recognition. These are ""something you are,"" making them difficult to lose or forget."
"How does face recognition work as an ""Inherence Factor"" for authentication?","Face recognition works as an ""Inherence Factor"" for authentication by identifying or verifying a person based on their unique facial features. It is categorized as ""something you are"" because it uses inherent biological characteristics of the user to confirm their identity."
What is a PIN and which authentication factor does it belong to?,"A PIN, or Personal Identification Number, is a numerical code used for authentication. It belongs to the ""Knowledge Factor"" because it is ""something you know"" that is used to verify your identity."
What is a security question and which authentication factor does it belong to?,"A security question is a pre-defined question that only the legitimate user is expected to know the answer to, used for authentication. It belongs to the ""Knowledge Factor"" because it relies on ""something you know"" to verify identity."
"What are the risks associated with using ""123456"" as a password?","Using ""123456"" as a password carries a high risk because it is listed as the most popular weak password. It is a short, sequential numerical phrase that is extremely easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess, making accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access."
"Why is ""QWERTY"" considered a weak password?","""QWERTY"" is considered a weak password because it is a recognizable keystroke pattern. It represents the sequence of keys on the top row of a standard keyboard, making it easy to guess for anyone familiar with keyboard layouts or for password-cracking software."
How do Operating Systems prevent what users/processes cannot do?,"Operating Systems (OS) prevent what users/processes cannot do by enforcing strict access controls and permissions. After a user or process is authenticated, the OS consults its authorization policies to determine which resources they are allowed to access and which operations they are permitted to perform, blocking any unauthorized attempts."
What is the primary difference in security needs between DOS and MacOS/Linux/NT-based Windows?,"The primary difference in security needs between DOS and MacOS/Linux/NT-based Windows stems from their user models. DOS is a single-user system, primarily needing protection against physical threats. MacOS, Linux, and NT-based Windows are multi-user systems, requiring robust security mechanisms to manage multiple users, isolate their processes, and protect against untrusted users and applications."
"In the context of OS security, what does ""resource"" refer to?","In the context of Operating System (OS) security, ""resource"" refers to any component or data within the system that needs protection. This can include files, memory, CPU time, network connections, peripherals, and applications. The OS is responsible for protecting these resources from unauthorized access or modification."
"What is the purpose of the ""Processes"" component in the OS security protection diagram?","In the OS security protection diagram, ""Processes"" represent the active execution of programs or applications on behalf of users. These processes interact with system resources, and the Operating System's security stages (Authentication, Authorization, Logging/Monitoring/Auditing) are applied to control and monitor their actions to ensure they operate within their authorized permissions."
How does the OS ensure that users only access authorized resources?,"The Operating System (OS) ensures that users only access authorized resources through a two-step process: Authentication and Authorization. First, Authentication verifies the user's identity. Then, Authorization, with Access Control, determines which specific resources the authenticated user is permitted to access and prevents access to any unauthorized resources."
"What is the role of ""User"" in the OS security protection model?","In the Operating System (OS) security protection model, ""User"" represents an individual or entity attempting to interact with the OS and its resources. The user initiates processes and requests access, which then triggers the OS's security stages, starting with authentication to verify their identity."
Why is it important for an Operating System to prevent what users/processes cannot do?,"It is important for an Operating System (OS) to prevent what users/processes cannot do to maintain system integrity, confidentiality, and availability. By enforcing restrictions, the OS protects critical system resources, prevents unauthorized data access or modification, and safeguards against malicious activities or accidental errors that could compromise the system's security and stability."
What is the primary difference in security challenges between simple real-time systems and modern PCs/smartphones regarding applications?,"The primary difference in security challenges regarding applications between simple real-time systems and modern PCs/smartphones is the source and trust level of applications. Simple real-time systems only run one specific app from trusted sources, minimizing app-related risks. Modern PCs and smartphones, however, run apps from third-party developers, meaning ""not all apps are trusted,"" which introduces a significant challenge of managing and mitigating risks from potentially malicious or vulnerable software."
