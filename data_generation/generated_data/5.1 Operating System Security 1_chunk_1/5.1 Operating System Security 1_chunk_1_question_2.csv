What are the primary security challenges faced by modern operating systems?,"Modern operating systems face several security challenges stemming from their evolution. These include the transition from single-user to multi-user environments, the shift from trusted applications to untrusted applications, and the move from standalone systems to networked systems."
Explain the security implications of the transition from single-user to multi-user operating systems.,"The transition from single-user to multi-user operating systems introduces a significant security challenge because not all users are trusted. In single-user systems like DOS, security concerns are simpler. However, in multi-user systems such as MacOS, Linux, NT-based Windows, and cloud computing environments, multiple users can run on the same system without knowing each other, making it crucial to manage trust and access among them."
How has the shift from trusted applications to untrusted applications impacted operating system security?,"The shift from trusted applications to untrusted applications has created new security vulnerabilities. Simple real-time systems traditionally ran only specific applications from trusted sources. However, modern PCs and smartphones run applications from third-party developers, meaning that not all applications can be trusted, necessitating robust security measures to protect the system from potentially malicious software."
What are the security concerns that arise when standalone computer systems become networked systems?,"When standalone computer systems become networked systems, they face external unknown threats that were not present when they were isolated. Isolated computer systems primarily needed protection against physical threats. However, once connected to networks, the system's attack surface expands significantly, and not all network components can be trusted, requiring comprehensive network security protocols."
List the main security protection stages within an Operating System.,"The main security protection stages within an Operating System (OS) are: Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing."
What is the fundamental responsibility of an Operating System regarding security protection?,The fundamental responsibility of an Operating System (OS) regarding security protection is to protect the applications and resources inside it. This involves controlling what users and processes are allowed to do and preventing what they are not allowed to do.
Define Authentication in the context of computer security.,"Authentication is the process by which a computer verifies the identity of a user, determining if they are indeed a correct and legitimate user. It answers the question: ""How does a computer know if I am a correct user?"""
What are the three main factors used for authentication?,"The three main factors used for authentication are: ""Something you know"" (Knowledge Factor), ""Something you have"" (Possession Factor), and ""Something you are"" (Inherence Factor)."
Explain the 'Knowledge Factor' in authentication and provide examples.,"The 'Knowledge Factor' in authentication refers to ""something you know,"" which is information only the legitimate user should possess. Examples include a password, a Personal Identification Number (PIN), public/private keys, and security questions."
What is the 'Possession Factor' for authentication? Give examples.,"The 'Possession Factor' for authentication refers to ""something you have,"" which is a physical item or device that only the legitimate user should possess. Examples include a smartcard, hardware tokens, and a smartphone."
Describe the 'Inherence Factor' in authentication and list its examples.,"The 'Inherence Factor' in authentication refers to ""something you are,"" which involves unique biological or behavioral characteristics of the user. Examples include biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition, fingerprint, and retina pattern."
Which authentication factor do passwords and PINs fall under?,"Passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) fall under the 'Knowledge Factor' of authentication, as they represent ""something you know."""
Categorize smartcards and hardware tokens within the authentication factors.,"Smartcards and hardware tokens are categorized under the 'Possession Factor' of authentication, representing ""something you have."""
"Where do biometrics, face recognition, and fingerprints fit into the authentication framework?","Biometrics, face recognition, and fingerprints fit into the 'Inherence Factor' of authentication, as they represent ""something you are,"" relying on unique biological characteristics."
What is considered the most common way to prove identity in computer systems?,"The most common way to prove identity in computer systems is through a password, which is a form of ""something you know"" authentication."
How does the security of a password-based authentication mechanism depend on the password itself?,"The security of a password-based authentication mechanism directly depends on the strength of the selected password. A stronger password reduces the chance that an attacker can guess it, thereby enhancing the overall security of the authentication process."
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"There is a trade-off between password security and convenience. A weak password is easy to memorize but also easy to be guessed by attackers. Conversely, a complex password is strong and difficult to guess, but it can result in frustrated users due to its difficulty in remembering and typing."
What defines a weak password?,"A weak password is defined as a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. These passwords lack complexity and predictability, making them vulnerable to various attack methods."
List the characteristics that make a password weak.,"Characteristics that make a password weak include: short passwords (e.g., a single word or numerical phrase like ""12345""), recognizable keystroke patterns (e.g., ""QWERTY""), personal information (e.g., date of birth, address, name), and repeated letters or numbers (e.g., ""55555"" or ""aaaa"")."
Why are short passwords considered weak?,"Short passwords are considered weak because they typically consist of a single word or a simple numerical phrase (e.g., ""password"" or ""12345""). Such brevity and simplicity make them much easier for attackers, including password-hacking software, to guess through brute-force or dictionary attacks."
How do recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to password weakness?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns contribute to password weakness because they are easy for attackers to predict. For example, patterns like ""QWERTY"" are directly visible on a keyboard and are often among the first combinations tried by those attempting to guess a password, making them highly insecure."
Why is using personal information in passwords a security risk?,"Using personal information in passwords, such as date of birth, address, or name, is a significant security risk because this information is often publicly available or easily discoverable by attackers. This makes it simple for bad actors to guess such passwords through social engineering or by compiling information from public records."
What is the risk associated with using repeated letters or numbers in a password?,"The risk associated with using repeated letters or numbers in a password (e.g., ""55555"" or ""aaaa"") is that these patterns are highly predictable and simple. They are among the first combinations that password-hacking software or even human attackers will try, making them extremely vulnerable to guessing attacks."

"Give three examples of weak passwords that are based on personal information or common words, as indicated in the document.","Three examples of weak passwords based on personal information or common words, as indicated in the document, are ""iloveyou"", ""princess"", and ""monkey"". These are easily guessable due to their commonality or association with personal attributes."
What does the 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table illustrate about password choices?,"The 'Password Popularity – Top 20' table illustrates that a significant number of users choose extremely simple, predictable, and easily guessable passwords. It highlights common patterns and words that make passwords weak and vulnerable to attacks, demonstrating a widespread lack of strong password practices."
"What is the role of 'Logging, Monitoring & Auditing' in OS security protection?","Logging, Monitoring & Auditing is a crucial stage in OS security protection. It involves recording system activities (logging), continuously observing system behavior for anomalies or security events (monitoring), and systematically reviewing logs and system configurations to ensure compliance and identify vulnerabilities (auditing). This helps detect and respond to security incidents."
How does an Operating System control what users and processes can do?,"An Operating System (OS) controls what users and processes can do primarily through Authorization with Access Control. After a user or process is authenticated, the OS uses access control mechanisms to determine which resources they are permitted to access and what operations they can perform on those resources."
Provide examples of single-user operating systems mentioned in the document.,An example of a single-user operating system mentioned in the document is DOS.
Provide examples of multi-user operating systems mentioned in the document.,"Examples of multi-user operating systems mentioned in the document include MacOS, Linux, and NT-based Windows."
What is the significance of 'Privilege Management in OS' as outlined in the document?,"The document outlines 'Privilege Management in OS' as a key area within operating system security. While not detailed, it implies the mechanisms and policies used to control and assign specific rights and permissions to users and processes, ensuring they only have the necessary privileges to perform their tasks, thereby limiting potential damage from security breaches."
Describe the overall flow of security protection stages as depicted in the OS security diagram.,"The overall flow of security protection stages in the OS security diagram begins with a User attempting to access the system. This triggers Authentication, which verifies the user's identity. Upon successful authentication, the user's Processes are then subject to Authorization, which determines their access rights to various Resources. Throughout these stages, Logging, Monitoring & Auditing continuously records and oversees activities for security purposes."
What is the purpose of Authorization with Access Control in OS security?,"The purpose of Authorization with Access Control in OS security is to determine what authenticated users and processes are permitted to do. After a user's identity is verified through authentication, authorization mechanisms, often implemented via access control lists or policies, grant or deny specific permissions to access or modify system resources."
What are public/private keys and their role in authentication?,"Public/private keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used in authentication as a 'Knowledge Factor' (something you know). The private key is kept secret by the user, while the public key can be shared. They are used in challenge-response protocols or digital signatures to verify a user's identity without transmitting the actual secret key."
What is a PIN in the context of authentication?,"A PIN, or Personal Identification Number, is a numerical code used as a 'Knowledge Factor' (something you know) for authentication. It is a secret number known only to the user, typically used to verify identity for accessing accounts, devices, or services."
What is a smartcard as an authentication method?,"A smartcard is a physical card with an embedded integrated circuit chip, used as a 'Possession Factor' (something you have) for authentication. It securely stores user credentials and can perform cryptographic operations to verify identity when presented to a compatible reader."
What is a hardware token for authentication?,"A hardware token is a physical device used as a 'Possession Factor' (something you have) for authentication. It typically generates a one-time password or a cryptographic challenge-response, which is then used in conjunction with a username and password to provide a stronger form of multi-factor authentication."
What are biometrics in the context of authentication?,"Biometrics refers to the use of unique biological or behavioral characteristics for authentication, falling under the 'Inherence Factor' (something you are). This includes methods like fingerprint scanning, face recognition, voice recognition, and retina patterns, which verify identity based on inherent personal traits."
How is face recognition used as an authentication method?,"Face recognition is an authentication method that falls under the 'Inherence Factor' (something you are). It uses unique facial features to verify a user's identity by comparing a live capture of their face against a stored template, often employing algorithms to detect and match key facial landmarks."
What is voice recognition as an authentication method?,"Voice recognition is an authentication method categorized under the 'Inherence Factor' (something you are). It identifies a user based on the unique characteristics of their voice, such as pitch, tone, and speaking patterns, by comparing a spoken phrase to a pre-recorded voiceprint."
What is a fingerprint as an authentication method?,"A fingerprint is an authentication method that uses the unique ridge patterns on a person's finger, falling under the 'Inherence Factor' (something you are). A scanner captures the fingerprint, and its distinct features are compared to a stored template to verify identity."
What is a retina pattern as an authentication method?,"A retina pattern is an authentication method that utilizes the unique pattern of blood vessels at the back of a person's eye, categorized under the 'Inherence Factor' (something you are). A specialized scanner illuminates the retina and captures its distinct pattern for identity verification."
What is a security question as an authentication method?,"A security question is an authentication method that falls under the 'Knowledge Factor' (something you know). It requires the user to provide a pre-defined answer to a specific question (e.g., 'What was your mother's maiden name?') to verify their identity, often used for password recovery or secondary verification."
What type of threats do isolated computer systems primarily need to protect against?,"Isolated computer systems primarily need to protect against physical threats, as they are not connected to external networks and thus not exposed to external unknown threats."
What is the implication of 'Not all users are trusted!' in multi-user operating systems?,"The implication of 'Not all users are trusted!' in multi-user operating systems is that the OS must implement robust mechanisms for authentication and authorization to differentiate between legitimate users and potential threats, and to restrict access to resources based on assigned privileges, even among users who share the same system."
What is the implication of 'Not all apps are trusted!' in modern computing environments?,"The implication of 'Not all apps are trusted!' in modern computing environments is that operating systems must incorporate strong security measures like sandboxing, permission management, and continuous monitoring to prevent malicious or vulnerable third-party applications from compromising system integrity or user data. Users must also exercise caution when installing applications."
What is the implication of 'Not all network components are trusted!' in networked systems?,"The implication of 'Not all network components are trusted!' in networked systems is that security measures must extend beyond the local system to encompass the entire network infrastructure. This requires implementing firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, secure communication protocols, and network segmentation to protect against external unknown threats and potential compromises originating from any part of the network."
How does cloud computing relate to the security challenge of single-user to multi-user systems?,"Cloud computing exemplifies the security challenge of single-user to multi-user systems by allowing multiple users from all over the world to run on the same system. These users typically do not know each other, which necessitates advanced security mechanisms within the operating system to manage access, isolate resources, and ensure that untrusted users cannot compromise the data or operations of others."
What is the difference in security needs between simple real-time systems and modern PCs/smartphones regarding applications?,"Simple real-time systems have a simpler security need regarding applications because they only run one specific app from trusted sources. In contrast, modern PCs and smartphones run apps from third-party developers, meaning not all apps are trusted, which significantly increases the complexity of security requirements to protect against potentially malicious or vulnerable software."
Why is '123456789' considered a weak password?,"'123456789' is considered a weak password because it is a sequential numerical phrase, making it highly predictable and easy for password-hacking software or even human attackers to guess. It's a common pattern that lacks the complexity needed for strong security."
What is the significance of 'Password' being a popular weak password?,"The significance of 'Password' being a popular weak password (used by 61,958 users in the top 20 list) is that it represents a severe lack of security awareness. Users choosing such a generic and obvious term make their accounts extremely vulnerable to dictionary attacks and simple guessing, highlighting the need for better password practices."
What is the role of 'Processes' in the OS security protection diagram?,"In the OS security protection diagram, 'Processes' represent the active execution of programs or tasks initiated by a user. These processes are the entities that, after a user is authenticated, seek authorization to access various system resources. The OS controls and monitors these processes to ensure they operate within their granted permissions."
What are NT-based Windows operating systems?,"NT-based Windows operating systems are a category of multi-user operating systems, alongside MacOS and Linux, that allow multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously. The 'NT' refers to 'New Technology,' indicating a more robust and secure architecture compared to earlier Windows versions like DOS."
What is the primary goal of OS security protection?,"The primary goal of OS security protection is to safeguard the applications and resources residing within the operating system. This involves establishing controls to dictate what users and processes are permitted to do, and conversely, preventing unauthorized actions by users or processes."
