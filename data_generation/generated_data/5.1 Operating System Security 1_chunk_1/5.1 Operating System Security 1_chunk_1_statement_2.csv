Describe the security challenges that arise when transitioning from single-user to multi-user operating systems.,"When an operating system transitions from a single-user to a multi-user environment, a significant security challenge emerges because not all users are trusted. In single-user systems like DOS, only one user interacts with the system. However, in multi-user systems such as MacOS, Linux, and NT-based Windows, multiple users can access the system. Cloud computing further exemplifies this, allowing numerous users worldwide to run applications on the same system without knowing each other, which necessitates robust security measures to manage trust among users."
Explain the security implications of moving from trusted applications to untrusted applications in modern operating systems.,"The shift from trusted applications to untrusted applications introduces a critical security challenge: not all applications can be trusted. Simple real-time systems typically run only one specific application from a trusted source. In contrast, modern PCs and smartphones commonly run applications developed by third parties. This means that the operating system must contend with the potential risks posed by applications whose origins or integrity are not fully guaranteed, requiring mechanisms to isolate and control their access to system resources."
What security challenges do networked systems present compared to standalone computer systems?,"Networked systems face external unknown threats, which is a significant security challenge compared to standalone computer systems. Isolated computer systems primarily need protection against physical threats. However, once a system is connected to a network, it becomes exposed to a broader range of potential attacks and vulnerabilities originating from the network. A key concern is that not all network components are trusted, requiring comprehensive security strategies to defend against these external threats."
Identify the primary security challenges in modern operating systems based on the evolution of computing environments.,"Modern operating systems face several primary security challenges stemming from the evolution of computing environments. These include: \n1. **From single-user to multi-user:** The introduction of multiple users, especially in cloud computing where users are unknown to each other, means that not all users can be trusted. \n2. **From trusted apps to untrusted apps:** Modern devices run applications from third-party developers, implying that not all applications can be trusted. \n3. **From standalone systems to networked systems:** Connecting systems to networks exposes them to external unknown threats, as not all network components are trusted."
Which type of operating system is described as truly single-user?,DOS (Disk Operating System) is described as a truly single-user operating system.
List examples of multi-user operating systems.,"Examples of multi-user operating systems include MacOS, Linux, and NT-based Windows."
How does cloud computing relate to the multi-user security challenge?,"Cloud computing exemplifies the multi-user security challenge by allowing multiple users from all over the world to run on the same system, even though they do not know each other. This scenario highlights the inherent difficulty in trusting all users and necessitates robust security measures."
What is a key security concern regarding applications in modern PCs and smartphones?,"A key security concern regarding applications in modern PCs and smartphones is that they run apps from third-party developers, meaning not all apps are trusted. This requires the operating system to implement safeguards against potentially malicious or vulnerable applications."
What kind of threats do isolated computer systems primarily need protection against?,Isolated computer systems primarily need to protect against physical threats.
What is the fundamental security issue when a system becomes networked?,"The fundamental security issue when a system becomes networked is that it faces external unknown threats, and not all network components are trusted. This expands the attack surface beyond physical threats."
List the security protection stages in an operating system.,"The security protection stages in an operating system include Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing."
What are the main components of OS security protection according to the outline?,"According to the outline, the main components of OS security protection are Security Protection Stages in OS, which comprise Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing, and Privilege Management in OS."
What is the primary responsibility of an operating system concerning security?,The primary responsibility of an operating system concerning security is protecting the applications and resources inside it.
How does an operating system exercise control over users and processes?,"An operating system exercises control over users and processes by controlling what users and processes can do, and by preventing what users and processes cannot do."
"Describe the flow of security protection stages involving a user, processes, and resources within an operating system.","The flow of security protection stages within an operating system typically starts with a User attempting to access resources through Processes. This interaction first goes through **Authentication**, where the user's identity is verified. Once authenticated, the request proceeds to **Authorization**, where access control mechanisms determine what the authenticated user or process is permitted to do with specific Resources. Throughout these stages, **Logging, Monitoring & Auditing** continuously records activities, tracks system behavior, and reviews security events to ensure integrity and detect anomalies."
What role does 'Authentication' play in the OS security protection diagram?,"In the OS security protection diagram, 'Authentication' is the initial stage where a user's identity is verified. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only legitimate users can proceed to request access to processes and resources within the operating system."
What is the purpose of 'Authorization' in the context of OS security protection?,The purpose of 'Authorization' in OS security protection is to determine what an authenticated user or process is permitted to do with specific resources. It works in conjunction with access control to grant or deny access based on defined policies and privileges.
"Explain the function of 'Logging, Monitoring & Auditing' in operating system security.","The function of 'Logging, Monitoring & Auditing' in operating system security is to record activities, track system behavior, and review security events. This stage is crucial for detecting anomalies, investigating security incidents, and ensuring compliance by maintaining a verifiable record of operations and access attempts."
How do users and processes interact with resources under OS security protection?,"Under OS security protection, users interact with resources indirectly through processes. A user initiates processes, which then undergo authentication and authorization checks before they are allowed to access or manipulate specific resources. The operating system mediates and enforces these interactions."
What does the OS prevent users and processes from doing?,"The OS prevents users and processes from doing what they are not authorized to do, thereby enforcing security policies and protecting system resources and applications."
Define authentication in the context of computer security.,"Authentication in the context of computer security refers to the process by which a computer verifies the identity of a user to determine if they are a correct and legitimate user. It answers the question, \""How does a computer know if I am a correct user?\"""
Categorize the different factors a computer uses to authenticate a user.,A computer uses three main factors to authenticate a user: \n1. **Knowledge Factor (something you know):** This includes information only the user should know. \n2. **Possession Factor (something you have):** This involves physical or digital items the user possesses. \n3. **Inherence Factor (something you are):** This relies on unique biological characteristics of the user.
