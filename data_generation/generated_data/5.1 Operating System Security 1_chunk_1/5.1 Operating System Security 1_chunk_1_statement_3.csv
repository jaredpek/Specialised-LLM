What are the primary security challenges in modern Operating Systems?,"The primary security challenges in modern Operating Systems (OS) stem from three major transitions:\n\n1.  **From single-user to multi-user systems:** While older systems like DOS were single-user, modern OS like MacOS, Linux, and NT-based Windows are multi-user. Cloud computing further complicates this by allowing multiple users globally to run on the same system without knowing each other, leading to the challenge that not all users are trusted.\n2.  **From trusted apps to untrusted apps:** Simple real-time systems only run specific applications from trusted sources. In contrast, modern PCs and smartphones run applications from third-party developers, introducing the challenge that not all apps are trusted.\n3.  **From standalone systems to networked systems:** Isolated computer systems primarily need protection against physical threats. However, once connected to networks, systems face external unknown threats, highlighting the challenge that not all network components are trusted."
Explain the security challenge associated with the transition from single-user to multi-user operating systems.,"The security challenge associated with the transition from single-user to multi-user operating systems is that not all users are trusted. In multi-user environments, such as MacOS, Linux, NT-based Windows, and especially cloud computing where multiple users worldwide can run on the same system without knowing each other, the assumption of inherent trust among all users is invalid. This necessitates robust security mechanisms to manage user access and privileges."
Describe the security implications of modern operating systems running untrusted applications.,"Modern operating systems, particularly on PCs and smartphones, face security implications because they run applications from third-party developers, meaning not all apps are trusted. Unlike simple real-time systems that only execute specific applications from trusted sources, this openness introduces a vulnerability where malicious or poorly secured applications can pose a threat to the system and its data."
How do networked systems introduce new security challenges compared to standalone systems?,"Networked systems introduce new security challenges compared to standalone systems because, once connected to networks, the system faces external unknown threats. Isolated computer systems primarily need to protect against physical threats. However, networking exposes the system to a broader range of potential attacks and vulnerabilities, as not all network components are trusted, requiring more sophisticated security measures."
List the security protection stages in an Operating System.,"The security protection stages in an Operating System (OS) are:\n1.  Authentication\n2.  Authorization with Access Control\n3.  Logging, Monitoring & Auditing"
What is the role of an Operating System in security protection?,"The Operating System (OS) is responsible for protecting the applications and resources inside it. It achieves this by controlling what users and processes are permitted to do and preventing what users and processes are not permitted to do, thereby enforcing security policies and safeguarding system integrity."
Define Authentication in the context of OS security.,"Authentication, in the context of Operating System (OS) security, is the process by which a computer verifies the identity of a user. It determines whether a user is who they claim to be, typically by requiring the user to provide credentials that match stored information."
What are the three main factors used for authentication?,"The three main factors used for authentication are:\n1.  **Knowledge Factor:** Something you know (e.g., password, PIN, public/private keys).\n2.  **Possession Factor:** Something you have (e.g., smartcard, hardware tokens).\n3.  **Inherence Factor:** Something you are (e.g., biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition)."

Why is password considered the most common way to prove identity?,Password is considered the most common way to prove identity because it has been widely adopted by various networking websites and applications. Its widespread use makes it a familiar and readily available method for user authentication across many platforms.
What determines the security of a password-based authentication mechanism?,"The security of a password-based authentication mechanism depends on the strength of the selected password. Specifically, it relies on how difficult it is for an attacker to guess the password, which is inversely proportional to its complexity and uniqueness."
Explain the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"The trade-off between password security and convenience is that weak passwords are easy to memorize but also easy to be guessed by attackers. Conversely, complex passwords are strong and difficult to guess, but they often result in frustrated users due to their difficulty in memorization and input."
What defines a weak password?,"A weak password is defined as a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. This typically includes simple, predictable, or commonly used sequences."
What are some characteristics that make a password weak?,"Some characteristics that make a password weak include:\n*   **Short passwords:** A single word (e.g., ""password"") or a numerical phrase (e.g., ""12345"").\n*   **Recognizable keystroke patterns:** Sequences that can be easily found on a keyboard (e.g., ""QWERTY"").\n*   **Personal information:** Details like date of birth, address, or name.\n*   **Repeated letters or numbers:** Simple repetitions (e.g., ""55555"", ""aaaa"")."
Provide an example of a weak password that is a short numerical phrase.,"An example of a weak password that is a short numerical phrase is ""12345"" or ""123456789""."
Provide an example of a weak password that is a single word.,"An example of a weak password that is a single word is ""password"" or ""princess""."
Why are passwords like 'QWERTY' considered weak?,"Passwords like 'QWERTY' are considered weak because they are recognizable keystroke patterns. These patterns are easy to identify by simply looking at a keyboard, making them highly predictable and susceptible to guessing by attackers or password-hacking software."
Why should personal information not be used in passwords?,"Personal information should not be used in passwords because it makes them weak and easy to guess. Details such as date of birth, address, or name can often be found through social engineering or public records, allowing bad actors to compromise accounts."
