Summarise the security challenges that arise from the evolution of operating systems from single-user to multi-user environments.,"The evolution of operating systems from single-user to multi-user environments introduces significant security challenges. A **single-user system** is designed for one user at a time, like DOS. In contrast, **multi-user systems**, such as MacOS, Linux, and NT-based Windows, allow multiple users to access and utilize the system concurrently. Cloud computing further extends this by allowing multiple users globally to run on the same system, often without knowing each other. The primary challenge here is that not all users can be trusted, necessitating robust security measures to manage user interactions and access."
Can you summarise the security implications of modern operating systems running untrusted applications?,"Modern operating systems face security implications due to the shift from running exclusively trusted applications to incorporating untrusted ones. Simple real-time systems typically run only one specific application from trusted sources. However, modern PCs and smartphones are commonly designed to run applications developed by third-party developers. The key implication is that not all these third-party applications can be trusted, which introduces vulnerabilities and potential security risks to the system and its data."
Provide a comprehensive summary of the security challenges introduced when standalone computer systems become networked systems.,"When standalone computer systems transition to networked systems, new security challenges emerge. **Standalone computer systems** are isolated and primarily need protection against physical threats, as their exposure is limited. However, once connected to **networked systems**, which are interconnected and can communicate with other systems, these systems become vulnerable to external and unknown threats. The fundamental challenge is that not all network components can be trusted, which expands the attack surface and requires more sophisticated security protocols to safeguard the system."
What are the three main categories of security challenges identified in modern operating systems?,"The three main categories of security challenges identified in modern operating systems are: first, the transition from single-user to multi-user environments; second, the shift from relying solely on trusted applications to running untrusted applications; and third, the evolution from standalone systems to networked systems. Each of these transitions introduces new vulnerabilities and complexities that require robust security measures."
Explain why 'not all users are trusted' is a key security challenge in multi-user operating systems.,"In multi-user operating systems, 'not all users are trusted' is a key security challenge because these systems allow multiple individuals, potentially from diverse locations and with varying intentions, to access and operate on the same system. For instance, cloud computing enables users worldwide to share a system without knowing each other. This lack of inherent trust among users necessitates strong authentication, authorization, and isolation mechanisms to prevent malicious or accidental harm to system resources and data by any user."
Describe the difference in application trust models between simple real-time systems and modern PCs/smartphones.,"The difference in application trust models between simple real-time systems and modern PCs/smartphones lies in their source and vetting. Simple real-time systems are designed to run only one specific application, which typically originates from trusted sources. In contrast, modern PCs and smartphones are built to run a multitude of applications developed by third-party developers. This shift means that while simple real-time systems operate in a highly controlled and trusted application environment, modern devices must contend with the challenge that not all third-party applications can be trusted, introducing potential security risks."
"What kind of threats do isolated computer systems primarily need to protect against, and how does this change when they become networked?","Isolated computer systems primarily need to protect against physical threats. This means security measures are focused on preventing unauthorized physical access or damage to the hardware. However, when these systems become networked, they face a broader array of external unknown threats. The connection to a network exposes them to potential attacks from remote adversaries, malware, and other vulnerabilities that exist within the network infrastructure, as not all network components are trusted."
List the key security protection stages within an Operating System.,"The key security protection stages within an Operating System include Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing."
What is the role of Privilege Management in an Operating System's security?,Privilege Management is identified as a key component in an Operating System's security. It refers to the mechanisms and policies used to control the permissions and capabilities granted to users and processes within the system.
Can you summarise the components of security protection stages in an OS?,"The security protection stages in an Operating System are comprised of Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing. **Authentication** verifies the identity of a user or process. **Authorization with Access Control** determines what authenticated users or processes are permitted to do. **Logging, Monitoring & Auditing** involves recording system activities, observing system behavior for anomalies, and reviewing logs to detect and investigate security incidents."
Provide a comprehensive summary of the Operating System's responsibility in security protection.,"The Operating System (OS) holds primary responsibility for protecting the applications and resources residing within it. Its role encompasses two main functions: first, the OS controls what users and processes are permitted to do, ensuring they operate within defined boundaries; and second, it actively prevents users and processes from performing actions they are not authorized to do, thereby safeguarding the system's integrity and confidentiality."
"Explain the flow of security protection stages within an Operating System, as depicted in the protection stages diagram.","The security protection stages within an Operating System, as depicted, begin with **Authentication**. Here, a **User** attempts to prove their identity to the **Operating System**. Upon successful authentication, the user's identity is linked to specific **Processes**. These processes then undergo **Authorization**, where the Operating System determines what actions they are permitted to perform on various **Resources**. Throughout these stages, **Logging, Monitoring & Auditing** functions are active, recording activities, observing system behavior, and reviewing events to maintain security and detect anomalies."
"What is the relationship between users, processes, and resources in the context of OS security protection?","In the context of OS security protection, users initiate processes, and these processes then attempt to access resources. The Operating System acts as an intermediary, first authenticating the user to confirm their identity. Once authenticated, the user's processes are subject to authorization, which dictates what specific resources they are allowed to interact with and what operations they can perform. This dual approach ensures that only legitimate users, through their authorized processes, can access and manipulate system resources."
Define 'Authentication' as a security protection stage in an OS.,"As a security protection stage in an Operating System, **Authentication** is the process by which the OS verifies the identity of a user or process. It is the initial step to confirm that an entity claiming a certain identity is indeed who or what it says it is, before any access to system resources or applications is granted."
Define 'Authorization with Access Control' as a security protection stage in an OS.,"As a security protection stage in an Operating System, **Authorization with Access Control** is the process that determines what an authenticated user or process is permitted to do. After identity is verified through authentication, access control mechanisms are applied to grant or deny specific permissions to resources or functions, ensuring that entities only perform actions they are explicitly allowed to."
"Define 'Logging, Monitoring & Auditing' as a security protection stage in an OS.","As a security protection stage in an Operating System, **Logging, Monitoring & Auditing** involves the systematic recording of events and activities within the system, continuous observation of system behavior for suspicious patterns, and subsequent review of these records. This stage is crucial for detecting security incidents, investigating breaches, and ensuring compliance with security policies."
How does the OS control what users and processes can do?,"The Operating System controls what users and processes can do through its security protection stages, primarily Authentication and Authorization with Access Control. First, **Authentication** verifies the identity of the user or process. Then, **Authorization with Access Control** mechanisms are applied to determine the specific permissions and actions that the authenticated user or process is allowed to perform on system resources and applications. This dual approach ensures that only legitimate and authorized activities are permitted."
How does the OS prevent what users and processes cannot do?,"The Operating System prevents what users and processes cannot do by enforcing strict access control policies following authentication. After a user or process is authenticated, the OS uses **Authorization with Access Control** to deny any attempts to access resources or perform actions for which they lack explicit permissions. This proactive prevention mechanism is fundamental to maintaining system integrity and confidentiality, ensuring that unauthorized operations are blocked."
Provide a comprehensive summary of how a computer determines if a user is correct during authentication.,"During authentication, a computer determines if a user is correct by verifying one or more factors that prove the user's identity. These factors are categorized into three main types: **Something you know**, such as a password, PIN, or public/private keys; **Something you have**, which includes physical items like a smartcard or hardware token; and **Something you are**, which refers to unique biological characteristics like biometrics, face recognition, or fingerprint scans. By successfully presenting one or more of these factors, a user can prove their identity to the system."
"Summarise the 'Knowledge Factor' in authentication, providing examples.","The 'Knowledge Factor' in authentication refers to 'something you know' to prove your identity. This category includes credentials that only the legitimate user is supposed to know. Examples provided are a password, a Personal Identification Number (PIN), public/private keys, and security questions. These are typically secret pieces of information that a user must recall and provide to gain access."
"Summarise the 'Possession Factor' in authentication, providing examples.","The 'Possession Factor' in authentication refers to 'something you have' to prove your identity. This category involves physical items that are in the legitimate user's possession. Examples include a smartcard, hardware tokens, and a smartphone. These items serve as a form of digital key or identifier that must be presented to the system for authentication."
"Summarise the 'Inherence Factor' in authentication, providing examples.","The 'Inherence Factor' in authentication refers to 'something you are' to prove your identity. This category relies on unique biological or physical characteristics of the legitimate user. Examples include biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition, fingerprint scans, and retina patterns. These methods leverage inherent traits of an individual for identity verification."
"What are the three main factors used in authentication, and what do they represent?","The three main factors used in authentication are the Knowledge Factor, Possession Factor, and Inherence Factor. The **Knowledge Factor** represents 'something you know' (e.g., password). The **Possession Factor** represents 'something you have' (e.g., smartcard). The **Inherence Factor** represents 'something you are' (e.g., fingerprint)."
Provide examples of 'something you know' authentication methods.,"Examples of 'something you know' authentication methods include passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), public/private keys, and security questions."
Provide examples of 'something you have' authentication methods.,"Examples of 'something you have' authentication methods include smartcards, hardware tokens, and smartphones."
Provide examples of 'something you are' authentication methods.,"Examples of 'something you are' authentication methods include biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition, fingerprint scans, and retina patterns."
Explain the concept of 'public/private keys' as an authentication factor.,"Public/private keys are an example of the 'Knowledge Factor' in authentication, representing 'something you know'. This method relies on the user possessing secret cryptographic keys to prove their identity."
How does a smartphone serve as a 'Possession Factor' for authentication?,"A smartphone serves as a 'Possession Factor' for authentication because it is a physical item that the legitimate user has. It can be used in various ways to prove identity, such as receiving one-time passcodes (OTPs) or generating codes through authenticator apps, thereby verifying 'something you have'."
What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes 'Inherence Factor' from 'Knowledge' and 'Possession' factors?,"The primary characteristic that distinguishes the 'Inherence Factor' from 'Knowledge' and 'Possession' factors is its reliance on unique biological or physical attributes of the user. While 'Knowledge' factors depend on memorized secrets and 'Possession' factors depend on physical objects, 'Inherence' factors leverage inherent traits like fingerprints, face recognition, or retina patterns, which are intrinsic to the individual."
Provide a comprehensive summary of why passwords are the most common authentication method and their security implications.,"Passwords are the most common way to prove identity, widely adopted by various networking websites and applications. The security of a password-based authentication mechanism is directly dependent on the strength of the chosen password, which dictates the likelihood of an attacker being able to guess it. There is a fundamental trade-off between password security and user convenience: weak passwords are easy to memorize but also easy to guess, while complex passwords offer strong security but can lead to user frustration due to difficulty in remembering them."
Summarise the trade-off between password security and convenience.,"The trade-off between password security and convenience is a critical consideration in authentication. Weak passwords are easy for users to memorize, which enhances convenience, but they are also easy for attackers to guess, compromising security. Conversely, complex passwords offer strong security, making them difficult for attackers to guess, but they often result in frustrated users because they are hard to remember and manage."
Why is the strength of a selected password crucial for the security of password-based authentication?,"The strength of a selected password is crucial for the security of password-based authentication because it directly determines the chance an attacker has of guessing the password. A strong, complex password significantly reduces the probability of successful brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks, thereby enhancing the overall security of the authentication mechanism. Conversely, a weak password makes it much easier for an attacker to compromise an account."
What makes passwords the most common way to prove identity?,Passwords are the most common way to prove identity because they have been widely adopted by various networking websites and applications. Their ubiquity and relative simplicity in implementation and use have made them a default choice for authentication across a vast array of digital services.
Describe the characteristics of a weak password that make it easy to guess.,"A weak password is a character combination that is easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. Characteristics that contribute to a password being weak include being short (e.g., a single word like 'password' or a numerical phrase like '12345'), containing recognizable keystroke patterns (e.g., 'QWERTY'), incorporating personal information (e.g., date of birth, address, name), or consisting of repeated letters or numbers (e.g., '55555', 'aaaa')."
Provide a comprehensive summary of what constitutes a weak password and its common characteristics.,"A **weak password** is defined as a character combination that can be easily guessed by friends, malicious actors, or password-hacking software. Common characteristics of weak passwords include being short, such as a single word (e.g., 'password') or a simple numerical phrase (e.g., '12345'). They often feature recognizable keystroke patterns, like 'QWERTY', or incorporate personal information such as a date of birth, address, or name. Additionally, passwords composed of repeated letters or numbers (e.g., '55555', 'aaaa') are also considered weak due to their predictability."
Summarise the types of character combinations that make a password weak.,"Character combinations that make a password weak include short passwords, which can be a single word or a numerical phrase (e.g., 'password', '12345'). Passwords also become weak if they contain recognizable keystroke patterns, such as 'QWERTY'. The inclusion of personal information like a date of birth, address, or name also renders a password weak. Finally, passwords with repeated letters or numbers (e.g., '55555', 'aaaa') are easily guessable and thus considered weak."
"Explain why short passwords are considered weak, providing examples.","Short passwords are considered weak because they are easy for friends, bad actors, or password-hacking software to guess. They often consist of a single word, such as 'password', or a simple numerical phrase, like '12345'. The limited character set and commonality of these combinations make them highly susceptible to dictionary attacks and brute-force attempts, significantly reducing their security strength."
Why are recognizable keystroke patterns considered a characteristic of a weak password?,"Recognizable keystroke patterns are considered a characteristic of a weak password because they are predictable and easy for attackers to guess. For example, patterns like 'QWERTY' are derived directly from the keyboard layout, making them common and easily discoverable by password-hacking software or even by simply looking at a keyboard. This predictability undermines the password's security."
How does including personal information make a password weak?,"Including personal information in a password makes it weak because such details are often publicly available or easily discoverable by attackers. Information like a date of birth, address, or name can be used in targeted guessing attacks or dictionary attacks, where attackers compile lists of common personal data to try as passwords. This predictability significantly compromises the password's security."
Why are repeated letters or numbers considered a characteristic of a weak password?,"Repeated letters or numbers are considered a characteristic of a weak password because they are highly predictable and simple patterns. Examples like '55555' or 'aaaa' are easy for humans to guess and for password-hacking software to generate and test quickly. This simplicity drastically reduces the entropy of the password, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks."
