What are the fundamental bases of authentication?,"The fundamental bases of authentication are categorized into three main types: what you know, what you possess, and what you are. These represent the different categories of information or attributes that can be used to verify an individual's identity."
Explain password-related techniques in authentication.,"Password-related techniques involve using passwords as a primary method for authentication. This includes how passwords are stored (e.g., plaintext, encrypted, or hashed), the policies that govern password selection and usage (e.g., complexity rules, number of failed attempts), the practice of 'salting' passwords, and alternative forms of passwords such as passphrases, one-time passwords, and visual passwords."
"What are the different methods for storing passwords, and what are their implications?","Passwords can be stored in several ways: 
1. Plaintext: Passwords are stored exactly as entered. This is considered BAD because it offers no protection against unauthorized access. If the storage is compromised, the passwords are immediately exposed.
2. Encrypted: Passwords are transformed using an encryption algorithm. This is considered FAIR, as it provides some protection, but the security depends on the strength of the encryption and key management. If the encryption key is compromised, the passwords can be recovered.
3. Hashed: Passwords are transformed using a one-way cryptographic hash function. This is considered GOOD. Hashing is a process where a function takes an input (the password) and produces a fixed-length output (the hash). It is designed to be computationally infeasible to reverse, meaning you cannot easily determine the original password from its hash. This is the most secure method for password storage."
"What is a one-way function, and how does it relate to password security?","A one-way function is a mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute in one direction but computationally hard to reverse. In the context of password security, one-way functions, specifically hash functions, are used to transform passwords into a fixed-length string of characters (a hash). It is easy to compute the hash of a given password, but it is extremely difficult to find the original password if only its hash is known. This property is crucial for secure password storage, as it prevents attackers from easily obtaining passwords even if they gain access to the stored hashes."
"What are hash functions, and what are their key properties?","Hash functions are a type of one-way function. A hash function, denoted as 'h', takes an input 'x' of arbitrary length and produces an output 'h(x)' of a fixed length. Key properties of secure hash functions include:
1. Pre-image resistance: Given a hash value 'y', it is computationally infeasible to find an input 'x' such that h(x) = y. This means you cannot easily find the original input from its hash.
2. Collision resistance: It is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs, 'x' and 'y' (where x â‰  y), such that their hash values are the same, i.e., h(x) = h(y). This ensures that different inputs produce unique hashes, reducing the chance of malicious manipulation."
What is 'salting' in the context of password security?,"Salting is a security technique where random data, known as a 'salt', is added to a password before it is hashed. The salt is then stored along with the password hash. When a user attempts to log in, the same salt is retrieved and combined with the entered password before hashing. This process ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different because they will have different salts. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks, making it much harder for attackers to pre-compute or quickly find password hashes."
What are some alternative forms of passwords?,"Besides traditional character-based passwords, alternative forms of passwords include passphrases (longer, more complex sequences of words), one-time passwords (passwords that are valid for only a single login session or transaction), and visual passwords (which involve selecting images or patterns)."
What are the risks associated with storing passwords in plaintext?,"Storing passwords in plaintext poses significant security risks. If a system's storage is compromised, either by an insider (like a system administrator) or an external attacker who gains access, all the passwords stored in plaintext are immediately exposed. This lack of protection means that an attacker can easily obtain user credentials, leading to unauthorized access to accounts and systems. Consequently, disputes regarding unauthorized access become more likely because the compromised credentials can be directly used."
How does storing hashed or encrypted passwords improve security compared to plaintext?,"Storing hashed or encrypted passwords offers a degree of protection against unauthorized access that plaintext storage does not. When passwords are encrypted or hashed, only the transformed versions are stored. During authentication, the user's entered password is also encrypted or hashed and then compared against the stored version. This means that even if the database of stored passwords is accessed by an insider or attacker, they will only obtain the encrypted or hashed forms, not the actual passwords. This provides some protection against direct credential theft and reduces the risk of disputes arising from compromised passwords."
Where are password hashes typically stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in specific password files. In Windows systems, these are typically found in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`. In Unix-like systems, older versions stored them in `/etc/passwd`, but modern Unix/Linux systems store them in a more secure file called the 'shadow file', located at `/etc/shadow`."
What are the security concerns regarding temporary password storage at the application level?,"At the application level, passwords can sometimes be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even on a web page. The primary security concern here is that the management of these temporary storage locations is often beyond the user's control. This means a password might be retained for longer than the user expects or intends, increasing the window of vulnerability if these locations are accessed by unauthorized parties. It is strongly advised not to save passwords in cache."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a process where the verifier (system) does not store the actual passwords but only their hashes. When a claimant (user) provides their password, the verifier applies the same hashing function to it. The resulting hash is then compared to the stored hash associated with the claimant's identity. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the claimant is authenticated and accepted. If they do not match, the claimant is rejected. This method ensures that the system never needs to know or store the user's actual password, enhancing security."
What is the role of a verifier in hashed password verification?,"In hashed password verification, the verifier (often the system itself) plays a crucial role in ensuring secure authentication. The verifier's primary responsibility is to store only the hashes of users' passwords, not the passwords themselves. When a user attempts to log in, the verifier takes the provided password, hashes it using the same algorithm and salt (if used) as when the password was originally stored, and then compares this newly generated hash with the stored hash. This process allows the verifier to confirm the user's identity without ever having direct access to their actual password."
What is the difference between weak/simple authentication and strong authentication?,"Weak or simple authentication typically relies on a single factor, such as password-based verification, and is often unilateral, meaning only one entity proves its identity to the other. In contrast, strong authentication aims for higher security. It often involves mutual authentication, where both parties involved in the communication verify each other's identities. Strong authentication also utilizes techniques like challenge-response protocols, which involve a sequence of steps to prove knowledge of shared secrets without revealing the secrets themselves, and employs concepts like zero-knowledge proofs."
What is unilateral authentication?,"Unilateral authentication is a type of authentication where only one entity in a communication proves its identity to the other. For example, in a typical login scenario, the user (claimant) proves their identity to the system (verifier), but the system does not necessarily prove its identity back to the user. This is contrasted with mutual authentication where both parties authenticate each other."
Explain challenge-response protocols in the context of authentication.,"Challenge-response protocols are a method used in authentication, particularly in strong authentication, to prove knowledge of a shared secret without revealing the secret itself. The process typically involves the verifier sending a 'challenge' (e.g., a random number or data) to the claimant. The claimant then uses the shared secret to compute a 'response' to this challenge and sends it back. The verifier checks if the response is correct. If it is, the claimant's identity is verified. This sequence of steps helps to prevent replay attacks and ensures that the secret is not transmitted over the network."
What are zero-knowledge proofs in authentication?,"Zero-knowledge proofs are an advanced cryptographic concept used in authentication, particularly within challenge-response protocols. They allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a certain piece of information (like a secret) without revealing any information about the secret itself, beyond the fact that they know it. This means the verifier learns nothing about the secret, hence the term 'zero-knowledge'."
What is mutual authentication?,"Mutual authentication is a security process where both parties involved in a communication exchange verify each other's identities. In a typical scenario, one party acts as the claimant, proving its identity to the other party, which acts as the verifier. Then, the roles are reversed, and the original verifier proves its identity to the original claimant. This two-way verification ensures that both entities are who they claim to be, which is a key component of strong authentication systems."
What are the different categories of authentication factors?,"Authentication factors are typically categorized into three main types: 
1. Something you know: This includes information that only the user should know, such as passwords, PINs, or answers to security questions.
2. Something you possess: This refers to physical items that the user has in their possession, like a security token, a smartphone, or a smart card.
3. Something you are: This category encompasses unique biological characteristics of an individual, known as biometrics, such as fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, or voice."
What are authentication tokens?,"Authentication tokens are physical or digital items that a user possesses to prove their identity. These can range from hardware devices like USB security keys or smart cards to software-based tokens that generate one-time passwords (OTPs) on a user's device, such as a smartphone. They serve as a form of 'something you possess' authentication factor."
What are biometrics in the context of authentication?,"Biometrics are unique, measurable biological characteristics used for authentication. They fall under the category of 'something you are'. Examples include fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, voice patterns, and even behavioral traits like typing rhythm. Biometric authentication offers a convenient way to verify identity as these characteristics are inherent to the individual and difficult to forge or lose."
What is the definition of a 'claimant' in authentication?,"In the context of authentication, a claimant is the entity that is attempting to prove its identity to another entity. The claimant is the one seeking to be recognized or granted access. The other entity, which verifies the claimant's identity, is known as the verifier."
What is a 'verifier' in an authentication system?,"A verifier is the entity in an authentication system responsible for checking and confirming the identity of another entity, known as the claimant. The verifier receives credentials or proof of identity from the claimant and compares it against a trusted source or set of rules to determine if the claimant is legitimate. Examples of verifiers include login systems, access control mechanisms, or security protocols."
What does it mean for a password to be 'hashed'?,"When a password is 'hashed', it means that it has been processed by a cryptographic hash function. This function takes the original password as input and produces a fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash value. The hashing process is designed to be a one-way operation, meaning it's easy to compute the hash from the password, but extremely difficult to derive the original password from the hash. This is a key security measure for storing passwords."
What are the implications of using 'encrypted' passwords versus 'hashed' passwords?,"Using 'encrypted' passwords means they are transformed using an encryption algorithm, which can be reversed with the correct decryption key. This is considered 'fair' security. 'Hashed' passwords, on the other hand, are transformed using a one-way hash function, which is designed to be computationally infeasible to reverse. Hashing is generally considered 'good' and more secure for password storage because even if the stored hashes are compromised, the original passwords cannot be easily recovered. Encryption requires secure key management, while hashing relies on the inherent difficulty of reversing the function."
What are password policies?,"Password policies are a set of rules and guidelines that dictate how users should create, manage, and use their passwords. These policies are imposed to enhance security and typically include requirements for password complexity (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of different character types), rules regarding password changes (e.g., frequency of changes), and limitations on the number of failed login attempts before an account is locked. They aim to make passwords stronger and more resistant to attacks."
What is the purpose of imposing rules on password selection by users?,"Imposing rules on password selection by users is a critical aspect of password policies aimed at strengthening security. These rules typically mandate that passwords meet certain complexity criteria, such as having a minimum length, and including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The goal is to make passwords harder for attackers to guess or crack through brute-force or dictionary attacks, thereby protecting user accounts and sensitive data."
How does the number of failed attempts affect password security?,"The number of failed attempts is a crucial parameter in password policies that directly impacts security. By limiting the number of incorrect password attempts allowed within a certain timeframe, systems can prevent brute-force attacks. After a specified number of failed attempts, the system might temporarily lock the user's account, require a CAPTCHA, or enforce a lockout period. This mechanism helps to thwart attackers who are systematically trying to guess passwords."
What are the potential vulnerabilities of password-related techniques?,"Password-related techniques are susceptible to various attacks. These include:
- Dictionary attacks: Trying common words or phrases.
- Brute-force attacks: Systematically trying all possible combinations of characters.
- Credential stuffing: Using stolen credentials from one breach to try logging into other services.
- Phishing: Tricking users into revealing their passwords.
- Insider threats: Malicious actions by individuals with legitimate access.
- Weak password policies: Allowing easily guessable passwords.
- Insecure storage: Storing passwords in plaintext or with weak encryption."
What are some defense mechanisms against attacks on passwords?,"Defense mechanisms against attacks on passwords include implementing strong password policies (e.g., complexity requirements, regular changes), using secure password storage methods (hashing with salting), enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), employing intrusion detection systems to monitor for suspicious login activity, educating users about phishing and social engineering, and rate-limiting login attempts to thwart brute-force attacks."
What is a 'passphrase' as an alternative to a password?,"A passphrase is a sequence of words, often combined with punctuation and numbers, used as a password. Passphrases are typically longer and more memorable than traditional passwords, making them a stronger alternative. For example, 'CorrectHorseBatteryStaple' is a well-known example of a passphrase. The increased length and complexity derived from using multiple words significantly enhance security against guessing and brute-force attacks."
What are one-time passwords (OTPs)?,"One-time passwords (OTPs) are passwords that are valid for only a single login session or transaction. They are commonly used as a second factor in multi-factor authentication. OTPs can be generated by hardware tokens, software applications on smartphones (like authenticator apps), or sent via SMS. Their ephemeral nature makes them highly secure, as even if an OTP is intercepted, it cannot be reused for subsequent authentication attempts."
What are visual passwords?,"Visual passwords are an alternative form of authentication that uses images or patterns instead of traditional text-based passwords. Users might select a series of images in a specific order, click on certain parts of an image, or draw a pattern on a grid. This method can be more intuitive for some users and can offer a different layer of security, particularly when combined with other authentication factors."
What is the significance of 'computationally infeasible' in the context of hash function properties?,"'Computationally infeasible' means that it would take an unreasonable amount of computing power, time, or resources to perform a specific task, such as finding the original input from a hash value (pre-image resistance) or finding two different inputs that produce the same hash (collision resistance). In practical terms, it implies that for all intents and purposes, these operations are impossible to achieve with current or foreseeable technology within a practical timeframe."
What are some important hash functions used for cryptography and password hashing?,"Important hash functions include SHA-256 and SHA-512, which are widely used in cryptography. For password hashing, specific algorithms like Argon2 and bcrypt are recommended due to their design, which incorporates features like computational cost and memory requirements to slow down brute-force attacks. KECCAK is another cryptographic hash function."
Explain the concept of 'pre-image resistant' for a hash function.,"A hash function H is considered 'pre-image resistant' if, given a hash value 'y', it is computationally infeasible to find an input 'x' such that H(x) = y. In simpler terms, if you have the output of a hash function, it's extremely difficult to figure out what the original input was. This property is vital for security, as it prevents attackers from reconstructing original data from its hash."
Explain the concept of 'collision resistant' for a hash function.,"A hash function H is considered 'collision resistant' if it is computationally infeasible to find a pair of distinct inputs, 'x' and 'y' (where x â‰  y), such that their hash values are identical, i.e., H(x) = H(y). This property ensures that different inputs produce different hash outputs. If collisions were easy to find, an attacker could potentially substitute a malicious input for a legitimate one that produces the same hash, compromising the integrity of the data."
What is the difference between hashing for cryptography and hashing for password storage?,"While both use hash functions, hashing for cryptography often prioritizes speed and efficiency in generating hashes, such as with SHA-256. Hashing for password storage, however, requires algorithms like Argon2 or bcrypt that are intentionally designed to be computationally intensive and resource-demanding (e.g., using significant memory). This increased computational cost is crucial for slowing down brute-force attacks, making it much harder and more expensive for attackers to crack passwords."
What are the security implications of storing passwords in plaintext?,"Storing passwords in plaintext means they are stored in their original, readable form. This is highly insecure because if the system's storage is compromised, an attacker gains direct access to all user passwords. This can lead to widespread account takeovers, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. It also makes it difficult to resolve disputes related to unauthorized access, as the compromised credentials can be directly used."
How do hashed/encrypted passwords provide better security than plaintext passwords?,"Hashed or encrypted passwords offer improved security because the actual passwords are not stored. Instead, their transformed representations (hashes or ciphertexts) are kept. When a user logs in, their entered password is transformed in the same way and compared to the stored version. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the stored data, they will only retrieve the transformed passwords, not the original ones. This significantly reduces the risk of direct credential theft and provides a layer of protection against unauthorized access."
What is the primary function of salts in password security?,"The primary function of salts in password security is to defend against dictionary attacks. By adding a unique, random salt to each password before hashing, even identical passwords will result in different hash values. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed tables of common password hashes (like rainbow tables) or easily identifying passwords that are the same across different users."
What are the risks of storing passwords in intermediate locations like buffers or caches?,"Storing passwords in intermediate locations such as buffers, caches, or on web pages carries risks because the management of these locations is often beyond the user's control. This means passwords might be retained for longer than intended, increasing the exposure window if these temporary storage areas are accessed by unauthorized individuals. It is advisable not to save passwords in cache due to these vulnerabilities."
What is the role of the 'password table' in hashed password verification?,"In hashed password verification, the 'password table' is a database maintained by the verifier (system) that stores user identities and their corresponding password hashes. When a claimant provides their password, the verifier hashes it and then looks up the claimant's identity in the password table to retrieve the stored hash. This stored hash is then compared with the newly generated hash to verify the claimant's identity."
What happens if the computed hash does not match the stored hash during verification?,"If the computed hash of the provided password does not match the stored hash in the password table during verification, the claimant's identity is not accepted. The system will then reject the login attempt. This indicates that the provided password was incorrect."
What does it mean for a system to 'accept' a claimant during authentication?,"When a system 'accepts' a claimant during authentication, it means that the claimant has successfully proven their identity. In the context of hashed password verification, this occurs when the hash of the password provided by the claimant matches the stored hash associated with their identity. Successful acceptance typically grants the claimant access to the system or resources they are trying to reach."
What does it mean for a system to 'reject' a claimant during authentication?,"When a system 'rejects' a claimant during authentication, it signifies that the claimant has failed to prove their identity. In the case of hashed password verification, this happens when the hash of the provided password does not match the stored hash. A rejection means the claimant is denied access to the system or the requested resources."
What are the three main categories of authentication factors?,"The three main categories of authentication factors are: 
1. Something you know: This includes information like passwords or PINs.
2. Something you possess: This refers to physical items like a security token or a smartphone.
3. Something you are: This encompasses unique biological traits like fingerprints or facial features (biometrics)."
How are password hashes stored in Windows operating systems?,"In Windows operating systems, password hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. This file is typically located in the `%windir%\system32\config\` directory."
Where are password hashes stored in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are stored in the 'shadow file', which is located at `/etc/shadow`. This is a more secure location compared to the older `/etc/passwd` file."
What is the difference between 'encrypted' and 'hashed' passwords in terms of security?,"Passwords stored as 'encrypted' are transformed using an encryption algorithm that can be reversed with a key, offering fair security. 'Hashed' passwords are processed by a one-way function, making them extremely difficult to reverse, which is considered good security. For password storage, hashing is preferred because it prevents the recovery of the original password even if the hash is compromised, unlike encryption where the key's compromise would reveal the password."
What are the main components of a password policy?,"A password policy typically includes rules on password complexity (e.g., length, character types), the frequency of password changes, and the number of failed login attempts allowed before an account is locked. These components are designed to enforce strong password practices and protect against unauthorized access."
