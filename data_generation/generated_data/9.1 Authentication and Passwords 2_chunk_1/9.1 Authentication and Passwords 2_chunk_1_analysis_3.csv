Analyse the basis of authentication with respect to the types of secrets.,"The basis of authentication relies on three types of secrets: what you know, what you possess, and what you are. These categories represent the fundamental principles by which an entity can prove its identity."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of password-related techniques?,"Password-related techniques encompass password storage, password policies, salting of passwords, and alternative forms of passwords. Password storage can be plaintext (bad), encrypted (fair), or hashed (good). Password policies define rules for password selection and the number of failed attempts. Salting involves adding random data to a password before hashing to enhance security. Alternative forms include passphrases, one-time passwords, and visual passwords."
"Explain the concept of ""salting"" of passwords.","Salting of passwords involves using random data, known as a salt, as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password. Salts are employed to safeguard passwords in storage and primarily serve to defend against dictionary attacks. By adding a unique salt to each password before hashing, even identical passwords will produce different hash values, making precomputed rainbow tables ineffective."
Describe the different methods of password storage and their implications.,"Password storage can be done in plaintext, which is considered bad as it offers no protection. It can also be encrypted, which is fair, or hashed, which is considered good. Hashed passwords are more secure because they are one-way functions that are easy to compute but hard to reverse. Plaintext storage means passwords are stored as is, while hashed/encrypted passwords store their transformed versions, offering some protection against unauthorized access."
What are the properties of a one-way function?,"A one-way function, denoted as 'f', is a function that is relatively easy to compute but hard to reverse. This means that given an input 'x', it is straightforward to compute the output 'f(x)'. However, given an output 'y', it is computationally infeasible to find an input 'x' such that 'y = f(x)'."
How do hash functions relate to one-way functions?,"Hash functions are a specific type of one-way function. A hash function 'f' takes an input 'x' of arbitrary length and produces an output 'f(x)' of a fixed length. This aligns with the definition of a one-way function, where computation is easy in one direction (hashing) but reversal is difficult."
Explain the concept of pre-image resistance in hash functions.,"A hash function 'H' is considered pre-image resistant if, given a hash value 'y', it is computationally infeasible to find an input 'x' such that 'H(x) = y'. This property ensures that it is difficult to determine the original input data from its hash value."
Define collision resistance for hash functions.,"A hash function 'H' is collision resistant if it is computationally infeasible to find a pair of distinct inputs, 'x' and 'y' (where x â‰  y), such that their hash values are the same, i.e., 'H(x) = H(y)'. This property is crucial for preventing attackers from substituting one input for another with the same hash."
What are some important hash functions mentioned for cryptographic and password hashing purposes?,"Important hash functions include SHA256 and SHA512, which are used for cryptographic purposes. For password hashing, notable functions are ARGON2 and bcrypt. KECCAK is also mentioned as a cryptographic hash function."
Compare and contrast weak/simple authentication with strong authentication.,"Weak/simple authentication is typically password-based and unilateral, where one entity (claimant) proves its identity to a verifier. This often involves proving knowledge of a secret by giving it up. Strong authentication, on the other hand, involves mutual authentication, where both parties act as claimant and verifier. It also utilizes challenge-response protocols, which allow parties to prove knowledge of shared secrets without revealing the secret itself, often through zero-knowledge proofs."
Explain the concept of unilateral authentication.,"Unilateral authentication is a type of weak/simple authentication where a single entity, referred to as the claimant, proves its identity to another entity, known as the verifier. In this process, the claimant demonstrates knowledge of a secret to establish its legitimacy."
What are challenge-response protocols in the context of authentication?,"Challenge-response protocols are a component of strong authentication. They involve a sequence of steps designed to prove knowledge of shared secrets. In this method, one party issues a challenge, and the other party must respond in a way that demonstrates they possess the secret without actually revealing it."
Describe the role of mutual authentication in strong authentication.,"Mutual authentication is a key characteristic of strong authentication. In this process, both parties involved in the authentication exchange take on the roles of both claimant and verifier. This means that not only does the user authenticate themselves to the system, but the system also authenticates itself to the user, ensuring that both parties are who they claim to be."
What are zero-knowledge proofs in authentication?,"Zero-knowledge proofs are a method used in strong authentication, specifically within challenge-response protocols. They allow a party to prove knowledge of a secret to another party without revealing any information about the secret itself. This is achieved by demonstrating that one possesses the secret through a series of interactions that do not expose the secret's content."
Analyze password storage in plaintext and its security implications.,"When passwords are stored in plaintext, they are stored in their original, unencrypted form. This means that if an attacker gains access to the database of passwords, they can immediately read all the passwords. This offers no protection against insider threats (like a system administrator) or external attackers who compromise the system. Consequently, disputes regarding unauthorized access are more likely to occur."
Analyze password storage using hashed/encrypted passwords and its security implications.,"In hashed/encrypted password storage, passwords are not stored in their original form but rather as their encrypted or hashed representations. When a claimant attempts to log in, their entered password is also hashed/encrypted and then compared against the stored hashed/encrypted version. This method provides some degree of protection against insider or external attackers, as they would need to decrypt or reverse the hash to obtain the actual password, which is computationally difficult for properly implemented hashing."
Where are password hashes typically stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in specific password files. In Windows systems, these are located in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, typically found at `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`. In Unix-like systems, historically, they were in `/etc/passwd`, but modern Unix/Linux systems store them in the more secure shadow file, located at `/etc/shadow`."
What are the risks associated with temporary password storage at the application level?,"At the application level, passwords may be temporarily held in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even on a web page. The management of these storage locations is often beyond the user's control. This means a password might be retained for longer than the user intends or expects, increasing the risk of exposure if these locations are compromised."
Explain the process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a claimant (A) providing their password to a verifier (system B). The verifier uses a password table that stores the hash of the claimant's password, denoted as h(password_A). The verifier then applies the same hash function 'h' to the password provided by the claimant, resulting in h(password). This computed hash is then compared to the stored hash h(password_A). If they match, the password is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. Crucially, the verifier does not store the actual passwords, only their hashes."
What is the primary function of salts in password security?,"The primary function of salts in password security is to defend against dictionary attacks. By adding a unique, random salt to each password before hashing, the resulting hash values are distinct even for identical passwords. This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables of common password hashes (rainbow tables) to quickly identify user passwords."
"Describe the characteristics of a ""good"" password storage method.","A ""good"" password storage method involves hashing the passwords. Hashing is a one-way function that is easy to compute but hard to reverse. This means that even if the stored hashes are compromised, it is computationally infeasible to determine the original passwords. This contrasts with plaintext storage (bad) or encrypted storage (fair), which may be more susceptible to decryption."
What are password policies and what do they typically include?,"Password policies are sets of rules that need to be imposed on users regarding the selection and management of their passwords. These policies typically include requirements for password complexity (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of different character types), rules about password changes, and the number of failed login attempts allowed before an account is locked."
What are alternative forms of passwords?,"Alternative forms of passwords are methods that deviate from traditional, simple text passwords. These include passphrases, which are longer sequences of words; one-time passwords (OTPs), which are valid for a single session or transaction; and visual passwords, which involve selecting images or patterns."
"Explain the concept of ""encrypted"" password storage.","Encrypted password storage involves transforming passwords using an encryption algorithm. While this is more secure than storing passwords in plaintext, it is considered only ""fair"" in terms of security. This is because encryption is typically a two-way process; if the encryption key is compromised, the passwords can be decrypted. Hashing, being a one-way process, is generally preferred for password storage."
"What does it mean for a hash function to be ""computationally infeasible""?","When a hash function is described as ""computationally infeasible"" to reverse or find collisions, it means that performing such an operation would require an unreasonable amount of computational resources (time, processing power) to be practical. For all intents and purposes, it is considered impossible to achieve within a realistic timeframe using current technology."
What are the implications of storing passwords in plaintext for system administrators?,"Storing passwords in plaintext offers no protection against insider threats, including system administrators. If passwords are in plaintext, a system administrator with access to the password file can easily view and misuse any user's password, leading to potential unauthorized access or data breaches. This lack of protection makes disputes regarding security breaches more likely."
How does salting protect against rainbow table attacks?,"Salting protects against rainbow table attacks by ensuring that each password generates a unique hash, even if the passwords themselves are identical. A rainbow table is a precomputed list of hashes for common passwords. If salts are used, an attacker cannot simply look up a hash in a standard rainbow table because the salt changes the resulting hash. They would need to generate a unique rainbow table for every possible salt, which is computationally prohibitive."
What is the difference between a password and a passphrase?,"A password is typically a short string of characters, often including letters, numbers, and symbols. A passphrase, on the other hand, is a longer sequence of words, which can be easier to remember for humans but still provides strong security due to its length and complexity. Both are used for authentication, but passphrases are considered an alternative, often more secure, form of password."
"Explain the concept of ""proving knowledge of secret by giving up the secret"".","Proving knowledge of a secret by giving up the secret is a characteristic of weak/simple authentication. In this method, the claimant must reveal the secret (e.g., their password) to the verifier to prove their identity. This is inherently insecure because if the secret is intercepted or compromised during transmission, it can be used by an attacker."
"Explain the concept of ""proving knowledge of secret WITHOUT giving up the secret"".","Proving knowledge of a secret without giving up the secret is a core principle of strong authentication, often achieved through challenge-response protocols and zero-knowledge proofs. Instead of revealing the secret itself, the claimant engages in a series of interactions with the verifier that demonstrate they possess the secret, without ever transmitting the secret's actual value."
"What are the security benefits of using ""hashed"" passwords over ""plaintext"" passwords?","Using hashed passwords provides significant security benefits over plaintext passwords. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it's easy to compute the hash from the password but extremely difficult to derive the password from the hash. If a database of hashed passwords is breached, the attacker cannot directly read the passwords. In contrast, plaintext passwords are immediately readable if the database is compromised, offering no protection."
What is the role of the verifier in hashed password verification?,"In hashed password verification, the verifier (typically the system) does not store the actual passwords. Instead, it stores the hash of the user's password. When a user attempts to authenticate, the verifier hashes the provided password and compares this computed hash with the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated. This prevents the verifier from being a single point of failure for storing actual passwords."
What is the difference between a hash function and a general one-way function?,"A hash function is a specific type of one-way function. A general one-way function 'f' is easy to compute but hard to reverse. A hash function is a one-way function that takes an input 'x' of arbitrary length and produces an output 'f(x)' of a fixed length. So, all hash functions are one-way functions, but not all one-way functions are necessarily hash functions (though in practice, cryptographic hash functions are the most common examples of one-way functions used in security)."
What are the security risks if a system administrator has access to plaintext passwords?,"If a system administrator has access to plaintext passwords, they can easily view and potentially misuse any user's password. This poses a significant security risk, as the administrator could gain unauthorized access to user accounts, sensitive data, or systems. This lack of protection against insiders makes disputes and security breaches more probable."
How can password policies help improve security?,"Password policies can help improve security by enforcing strong password practices among users. By setting rules for password complexity, length, and frequency of changes, organizations can make it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack passwords. Policies also often include measures like limiting the number of failed login attempts, which helps prevent brute-force attacks."
"What is the significance of a hash function producing an output of ""fixed length""?","The significance of a hash function producing an output of fixed length is that it standardizes the size of the hash value, regardless of the input size. This fixed length simplifies storage and comparison processes. For example, whether the input is a single character or a large document, the resulting hash will always be the same size (e.g., 256 bits for SHA-256), making it easier to manage and process."
"Explain the concept of ""fair"" password storage.","Password storage is considered ""fair"" when it uses encryption. In this method, passwords are encrypted before being stored. While this is better than storing them in plaintext, it is not as secure as hashing. Encryption is typically reversible if the encryption key is known or compromised, allowing an attacker to potentially recover the original passwords."
What are the potential issues with passwords stored in caches or buffers?,"Passwords stored temporarily in caches or buffers at the application level pose a security risk because their management is often beyond the user's control. These temporary storage locations might retain the password for longer than intended, increasing the window of opportunity for an attacker to access them if the system is compromised. It is advised not to save passwords in cache."
"What is the purpose of the ""password table"" in hashed password verification?","The password table in hashed password verification serves as a database that stores the hashed representations of users' passwords. When a claimant provides their password, the system hashes it and compares the result against the corresponding entry in the password table. This table allows the verifier to confirm the user's identity without storing their actual, sensitive passwords."
"Analyze the security of ""encrypted"" passwords compared to ""hashed"" passwords.","Encrypted passwords are considered ""fair"" in terms of security, while hashed passwords are ""good."" Encryption is a two-way process that can be reversed if the encryption key is compromised. Hashing, on the other hand, is a one-way function that is computationally infeasible to reverse. Therefore, hashed passwords offer a higher level of security because even if the stored hashes are stolen, recovering the original passwords is extremely difficult."
"What does it mean for a hash function to be ""good""?","A hash function is considered ""good"" when it is used for password storage. This implies that it possesses strong security properties, such as being a one-way function that is computationally infeasible to reverse and resistant to collisions. Hashing is preferred for password storage because it protects the original passwords even if the stored data is compromised."
"What are the security implications of ""dispute is possible"" in plaintext password storage?","The statement ""dispute is possible"" in the context of plaintext password storage highlights a critical security weakness. Because passwords are stored in an easily readable format, if unauthorized access occurs, it is difficult to definitively prove who was responsible or how the breach happened without further investigation. This ambiguity can lead to disputes and challenges in accountability."
How does the verifier (system) B handle the password in the hashed password verification process?,"In the hashed password verification process, the verifier (system B) receives the password from the claimant (A). It then applies a hash function 'h' to this provided password to generate a hash value, denoted as h(password). This computed hash is then compared with the stored hash of the claimant's password (h(password_A)) from the password table. The verifier does not store the original password itself."
"What is the purpose of imposing rules on the ""selection of passwords"" by users?","Imposing rules on the selection of passwords by users is a key aspect of password policies aimed at enhancing security. These rules typically dictate the minimum length, the required inclusion of different character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and restrictions on using easily guessable information. The goal is to ensure users create strong, unique passwords that are difficult for attackers to compromise."
"What are the security advantages of using ""authentication tokens""?","While the provided document does not detail the security advantages of authentication tokens, it lists them as a category alongside biometrics under 'Authentication tokens and biometrics' as a basis for authentication. This implies they are a method used to prove identity, likely offering a different security paradigm than password-based methods."
"What are the security advantages of using ""biometrics""?","The provided document lists biometrics as a basis for authentication, alongside 'what you know' and 'what you possess'. However, it does not elaborate on the specific security advantages of biometrics. Biometrics typically involve unique biological characteristics (like fingerprints or facial features) for authentication."
What is the relationship between password storage security and one-way functions?,"Password storage security relies heavily on a cryptographic construct called a one-way function. By using one-way functions, specifically hash functions, to store passwords, systems can ensure that even if the stored data is compromised, the original passwords remain protected because they are computationally infeasible to recover from their hashed form."
"What are the key differences between ""Plaintext (BAD)"" and ""Hashed (good)"" password storage?","The key difference lies in security. Plaintext password storage saves passwords as they are, making them immediately readable if accessed. This is ""BAD"" because it offers no protection. Hashed password storage converts passwords into a one-way, irreversible format. This is ""GOOD"" because even if the hashes are stolen, the original passwords are extremely difficult to recover, providing significant security against breaches."
