Provide a comprehensive summary of the basis of authentication.,"The basis of authentication relies on three fundamental principles: what you know, what you possess, and what you are. These principles form the foundation for verifying an individual's identity."
Summarize the different types of authentication techniques mentioned.,"Authentication techniques can be broadly categorized into weak/simple authentication and strong authentication. Weak/simple authentication is typically password-based and unilateral, where one entity (the claimant) proves its identity to a verifier. This often involves proving knowledge of a secret by revealing it. Strong authentication, on the other hand, involves mutual authentication, where both parties act as both claimant and verifier. It also encompasses challenge-response protocols, which are sequences of steps designed to prove knowledge of shared secrets without revealing the secret itself, often utilizing zero-knowledge proofs."
Explain password-related techniques.,"Password-related techniques involve several key aspects. These include password storage methods, such as storing passwords in plaintext (considered bad), encrypted (fair), or hashed (good) formats. Password policies define rules for password selection by users and the number of failed attempts allowed. Another technique is 'salting' of passwords, which involves adding random data to a password before hashing it to enhance security. Alternative forms of passwords also exist, including passphrases, one-time passwords, and visual passwords."
Define 'salt' in the context of password security.,"In the context of password security, a 'salt' is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function, typically a hash function, when processing a password. Salts are employed to safeguard passwords during storage. Their primary function is to defend against dictionary attacks by ensuring that even identical passwords will produce different hash values when combined with different salts."
Describe the concept of a one-way function.,"A one-way function, denoted as 'f', is a mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute but computationally hard to reverse. This means that given an input 'x', it is straightforward to calculate the output 'f(x)'. However, given an output 'y', it is extremely difficult to find an input 'x' such that 'y = f(x)'. Password storage security often relies on cryptographic constructs like one-way functions."
Explain how hash functions relate to one-way functions.,"Hash functions are a prime example of one-way functions. A hash function, 'H', takes an input 'x' of arbitrary length and produces an output 'H(x)' of a fixed length. This process is easy to compute in one direction (calculating the hash from the input) but difficult to reverse (finding the original input from the hash)."
What are the key properties of hash functions?,"A hash function 'H' is considered to satisfy important security properties. Firstly, it is 'pre-image resistant' if, given a hash value 'y', it is computationally infeasible to find an input 'x' such that 'H(x) = y'. Secondly, it is 'collision resistant' if it is computationally infeasible to find a pair of distinct inputs '(x, y)' such that 'x ≠ y' and 'H(x) = H(y)'. These properties are crucial for secure password hashing."
Summarize the differences between plaintext and hashed/encrypted password storage.,"Storing passwords in plaintext means the passwords are saved as is, and the claimant's password is checked directly against this database. This offers no protection against insiders or attackers who gain system access, making disputes possible. In contrast, hashed/encrypted passwords store only the encrypted or hashed versions of the passwords. The claimant's password is then hashed/encrypted and checked against this stored version. This method provides some degree of protection against insider or attacker threats."
Where are password hashes typically stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are stored in specific password files. In Windows systems, passwords are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at '%windir%\system32\config\SAM'. For Unix and modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are found in the '/etc/shadow' file, although older Unix systems used '/etc/passwd'."
What are the risks associated with temporary password storage locations?,"At the application level, passwords can be temporarily held in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even on web pages. The management of these storage locations is typically beyond the user's control. This poses a risk because a password might be retained for longer than the user intends or expects, potentially increasing its exposure to unauthorized access."
Explain the process of hashed password verification.,"Hashed password verification involves a system (verifier B) that does not store actual passwords, but rather their hashes. When a claimant (A) provides their password, the system applies a hash function 'h' to it, generating 'h(password)'. This generated hash is then compared to the stored hash for claimant A in the password table, which is denoted as 'h(password_A)'. If the generated hash matches the stored hash, the password is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected."
What are the three main categories for the basis of authentication?,"The basis of authentication is categorized into three main types: what you know, what you possess, and what you are. These represent the fundamental factors used to verify an individual's identity."
Describe 'unilateral' authentication.,"Unilateral authentication is a type of weak or simple authentication where one entity, known as the claimant, proves its identity to another entity, the verifier. This process typically involves the claimant demonstrating knowledge of a secret, often by revealing it."
What is a 'challenge-response' protocol in authentication?,A challenge-response protocol is a method used in strong authentication. It involves a sequence of steps where one party (the challenger) sends a challenge to another party (the responder). The responder must then use a shared secret to compute a response that proves their knowledge of that secret without actually revealing the secret itself. This is often related to zero-knowledge proofs.
What are the different methods for password storage?,"Password storage can be done using three main methods: Plaintext (BAD), which stores the password as is; 'encrypted' (fair), where the password is encrypted; and 'hashed' (good), where the password is run through a one-way hash function. Hashing is generally considered the most secure method for storing passwords."
What are 'password policies'?,"Password policies are a set of rules and guidelines that are imposed on users regarding their passwords. These policies dictate requirements for password selection, such as complexity or length, and may also specify actions based on the number of failed login attempts, like temporary account lockouts."
Explain the concept of 'salting' passwords.,"'Salting' of passwords is a security technique where random, unique data (the salt) is generated and appended to a password before it is hashed. This salt is then stored alongside the password hash. When a user attempts to log in, the same salt is retrieved and combined with the entered password before hashing, allowing for verification. This prevents attackers from using precomputed rainbow tables to crack passwords, as each password, even if identical, will have a unique hash due to the different salt."
What are some alternative forms of passwords?,"Besides traditional character-based passwords, alternative forms include passphrases, which are longer sequences of words; one-time passwords (OTPs), which are valid for a single login session; and visual passwords, which involve selecting images or patterns."
Define a 'one-way function' in cryptography.,"In cryptography, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse. Mathematically, if 'f' is a one-way function, it's easy to compute 'y = f(x)' given 'x', but hard to find 'x' given 'y'."
What is the relationship between hash functions and one-way functions?,"Hash functions are a specific type of one-way function. They take an input of any length and produce an output of a fixed length. This process is designed to be computationally efficient for generating the hash but computationally infeasible to reverse, meaning you cannot easily determine the original input from the hash output."
What does it mean for a hash function to be 'pre-image resistant'?,"A hash function is considered 'pre-image resistant' if it is computationally infeasible to find an input 'x' that produces a specific hash output 'y'. In simpler terms, given a hash value, it's practically impossible to determine the original data that was hashed."
What does it mean for a hash function to be 'collision resistant'?,"A hash function is 'collision resistant' if it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs, 'x' and 'y', that produce the same hash output. That is, it's extremely difficult to find a pair '(x, y)' where 'x ≠ y' but 'H(x) = H(y)'."
List some important hash functions for cryptography and password hashing.,"Important hash functions include SHA256 and SHA512, which are commonly used in cryptography. For password hashing, specific algorithms like Keccak (used in SHA-3), ARGON2, and bcrypt are recommended due to their design tailored for this purpose, often incorporating features like salting and computational cost adjustments to resist brute-force attacks."
What are the implications of storing passwords in plaintext?,"Storing passwords in plaintext means that the actual passwords are saved in a readable format. This provides no security against unauthorized access. If an attacker or even an authorized insider (like a system administrator) gains access to the system's password database, they can immediately see all the passwords. This lack of protection makes disputes possible and significantly increases the risk of account compromise."
How does hashed/encrypted password storage improve security compared to plaintext?,"Hashed/encrypted password storage enhances security by not storing the actual passwords. Instead, only the transformed versions (hashes or encrypted forms) are stored. When a user attempts to log in, their provided password is transformed using the same method and compared against the stored transformed value. This means that even if the database is compromised, the attacker only obtains the hashes/encrypted data, not the original passwords, offering a degree of protection against insider threats and external attackers."
"In Windows systems, where are password hashes stored?","In Windows operating systems, password hashes are stored within the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. This file is typically located in the system's configuration directory, specifically at '%windir%\system32\config\SAM'."
Where are password hashes stored in modern Unix/Linux systems?,"In modern Unix and Linux systems, password hashes are stored in a file named '/etc/shadow'. While older Unix systems might have used '/etc/passwd', the '/etc/shadow' file is the standard location for storing sensitive password hash information in contemporary Unix-like operating systems."
What is the risk of storing passwords in caches or buffers?,"Storing passwords temporarily in locations like buffers, caches, or on web pages carries significant risks. These intermediate storage locations are often beyond the user's direct control. This means that passwords might be retained for longer than intended, increasing the window of opportunity for them to be discovered by attackers or malicious insiders. It is generally advised not to save passwords in such temporary locations."
Describe the role of the verifier in hashed password verification.,"In the process of hashed password verification, the verifier (typically the system, denoted as B) plays a crucial role. The verifier maintains a password table that stores the hashes of users' passwords, not the passwords themselves. When a claimant (A) attempts to authenticate, the verifier receives the claimant's password, hashes it, and compares the resulting hash with the stored hash for that claimant. If they match, authentication is successful; otherwise, it fails."
What information does the verifier store in the password table?,"The verifier, in a hashed password verification system, stores the hashes of users' passwords in its password table. For each user, identified by their username or identifier (e.g., 'A'), the table contains the corresponding hash of their password (e.g., 'h(password_A)'). The verifier does not store the actual, plain-text passwords."
How is a password verified when using hashed passwords?,"When using hashed passwords, verification occurs as follows: The claimant provides their password. The verifier takes this provided password and applies the same hash function that was used to store the password initially. The resulting hash is then compared to the hash stored in the verifier's password table for that specific user. If the computed hash matches the stored hash, the claimant is authenticated; if not, authentication is rejected."
What are the three components that form the basis of authentication?,"The three components that form the basis of authentication are: 1. What you know (e.g., a password or PIN). 2. What you possess (e.g., a physical token or smart card). 3. What you are (e.g., biometric data like fingerprints or facial features)."
Explain the concept of 'mutual authentication'.,"Mutual authentication is a process where both parties involved in a communication or transaction verify each other's identity. Instead of one party simply verifying the other, both the claimant and the verifier take on both roles, proving their identities to each other. This is a key characteristic of strong authentication protocols."
What is the primary goal of 'salting' passwords?,"The primary goal of 'salting' passwords is to defend against dictionary attacks. By adding a unique, random salt to each password before hashing, even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed tables (like rainbow tables) that map common passwords to their hashes, as the salt makes each hash unique."
What are the security implications of storing passwords in plaintext?,"Storing passwords in plaintext is highly insecure because it offers no protection against unauthorized access. If the system's database is compromised, an attacker gains immediate access to all user passwords. This can lead to account takeovers, identity theft, and further system breaches. It also makes disputes possible, as the integrity of the stored credentials is compromised."
How does hashing improve password security?,"Hashing improves password security by transforming the original password into a fixed-size string of characters using a one-way function. This means that the original password cannot be easily recovered from its hash. When passwords are hashed and salted, it becomes significantly harder for attackers to crack them, even if they gain access to the database, as they would need to perform computationally intensive operations to try and reverse the hashes."
What is the difference between 'encrypted' and 'hashed' password storage?,"While both 'encrypted' and 'hashed' password storage aim to protect passwords, they differ in their reversibility. Encrypted passwords can be decrypted back to their original form using a key, meaning if the key is compromised, the passwords can be recovered. Hashed passwords, on the other hand, are generated using one-way functions, making them computationally infeasible to reverse. For password storage, hashing is generally preferred due to its one-way nature."
What is the purpose of the '/etc/shadow' file in Unix/Linux systems?,"The '/etc/shadow' file in Unix/Linux systems is specifically designed to store sensitive user account information, primarily password hashes. This separation from the '/etc/passwd' file (which contains less sensitive user information) enhances security by restricting access to the password hashes, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to obtain them."
Can you explain 'zero knowledge proofs' in the context of authentication?,"Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic method used in authentication where one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a certain piece of information, without revealing any information about the knowledge itself beyond the fact that they possess it. This is often employed in challenge-response protocols to prove knowledge of a secret without disclosing the secret."
What are the potential issues with password policies?,"Password policies, while intended to enhance security, can sometimes lead to user frustration or the adoption of predictable, insecure password practices if not well-designed. Issues can arise from overly complex rules that users struggle to remember, or from policies that don't adequately address the evolving threat landscape. The number of failed attempts is a common policy element, often leading to account lockouts."
Summarize the security risks of storing passwords in plaintext.,"Storing passwords in plaintext presents severe security risks. It means that the actual passwords are stored in a readable format, offering no protection against unauthorized access. If a system is breached, attackers can easily obtain all user credentials. This vulnerability can lead to widespread account compromise, identity theft, and further malicious activities. Furthermore, it makes it difficult to resolve disputes related to account access or misuse."
What is the significance of 'computationally infeasible' in the context of hash function properties?,"'Computationally infeasible' means that it would take an unreasonable amount of computational resources (time, processing power) to perform a specific task, such as finding a pre-image or a collision for a hash function. For practical security purposes, if a task is computationally infeasible, it is considered impossible to achieve with current or foreseeable technology, thus ensuring the security of the hash function."
How does the verifier ensure a user's identity using hashed passwords?,"The verifier ensures a user's identity by comparing the hash of the password provided by the user with the stored hash of that user's password. The user provides their password, the verifier hashes it using the same algorithm and salt (if used) as when the password was originally stored, and then checks if this newly computed hash matches the one stored in the password table. A match signifies successful authentication."
What are the main categories of authentication basis?,"The main categories for the basis of authentication are: 1. What you know (e.g., passwords, security questions). 2. What you possess (e.g., hardware tokens, smart cards). 3. What you are (e.g., biometric data like fingerprints, iris scans, or facial recognition)."
Explain the difference between unilateral and mutual authentication.,"Unilateral authentication involves a single entity proving its identity to another. For example, a user logging into a system. Mutual authentication, on the other hand, is a two-way process where both entities involved in a communication or transaction verify each other's identity before proceeding. This is common in secure network communications where both the client and the server authenticate each other."
What is the purpose of password storage security?,"The purpose of password storage security is to protect users' credentials from unauthorized access and misuse. This is achieved by employing secure methods for storing passwords, such as hashing, which prevents the plaintext passwords from being exposed even if the storage system is compromised. Secure storage is fundamental to maintaining user account integrity and preventing identity theft."
Describe the security advantage of using hashed passwords over plaintext passwords.,"The primary security advantage of using hashed passwords over plaintext passwords is that the original password cannot be easily recovered from the stored hash. Even if an attacker gains access to the database containing the hashes, they cannot directly obtain the users' passwords. This significantly raises the bar for attackers, as they would need to employ computationally intensive methods like brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks (which are further mitigated by salting) to try and crack the passwords."
What are the potential vulnerabilities in application-level password handling?,"Application-level password handling can be vulnerable if passwords are temporarily stored in insecure locations like buffers or caches. The management of these temporary storage locations is often outside the user's control, meaning passwords might persist longer than expected. This increases the risk of exposure to attackers who might gain access to these intermediate storage areas, potentially compromising user credentials."
