Analyse the basis of authentication with respect to the types of secrets used.,"The basis of authentication relies on three fundamental types of secrets that an entity can possess to prove its identity: 
1. What you know: This refers to information that only the user is aware of, such as a password or a PIN.
2. What you possess: This involves something tangible that the user has in their possession, like a security token or a smart card.
3. What you are: This relates to unique biological characteristics of the user, known as biometrics, such as fingerprints or facial features."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of weak/simple authentication?,"Weak or simple authentication is characterized by being password-based and unilateral. In unilateral authentication, only one entity, referred to as the claimant, proves its identity to another entity, the verifier. This typically involves the claimant proving knowledge of a secret by revealing it. This method is considered weak because the secret itself is exposed during the verification process."
What insights can you derive from the analysis of strong authentication?,"Strong authentication involves mutual authentication, where both parties in a communication exchange take on the roles of both claimant and verifier. It also utilizes challenge-response protocols, which are sequences of steps designed to prove knowledge of shared secrets without directly revealing them. This is achieved through mechanisms like zero-knowledge proofs, where the claimant can prove knowledge of a secret without disclosing the secret itself."
Describe password storage methods and their security implications.,"Password storage can be done in several ways:
1. Plaintext (BAD): Passwords are stored exactly as entered. This offers no protection and is highly insecure.
2. Encrypted (fair): Passwords are encrypted using an encryption algorithm. While better than plaintext, the security depends on the strength of the encryption and key management.
3. Hashed (good): Passwords are transformed into a fixed-length string of characters using a hash function. This is generally considered the most secure method for password storage as it is difficult to reverse."
Explain password policies and their role in password security.,"Password policies define the rules that users must adhere to when selecting passwords. These rules can include requirements for password complexity (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols), and the number of failed attempts allowed before an account is locked. The objective of password policies is to enhance the security of user accounts by encouraging the use of stronger, more resilient passwords and preventing brute-force attacks."
Define 'salting' of passwords and explain its purpose.,"Salting of passwords involves adding random, unique data, known as a 'salt,' to each password before it is hashed. A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that 'hashes' a password. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks by ensuring that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to the unique salt applied to each."
What are alternative forms of passwords?,"Alternative forms of passwords exist to enhance security and user experience beyond traditional text-based passwords. These include:
1. Passphrases: Longer sequences of words that are easier to remember than complex passwords but harder to guess.
2. One-time passwords (OTPs): Passwords that are valid for only a single login session or transaction, often generated by a hardware token or an app.
3. Visual passwords: Passwords that involve selecting images or patterns in a specific sequence, often used in graphical interfaces."
Explain the concept of a one-way function.,"A one-way function, denoted as \(f\), is a mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute in one direction but computationally hard to reverse. This means that given an input \(x\), it is straightforward to calculate the output \(f(x)\). However, given an output \(y\), it is extremely difficult to find an input \(x\) such that \(f(x) = y\). This property is fundamental to many cryptographic applications, including password hashing."
How do hash functions relate to one-way functions?,"Hash functions are a specific type of one-way function. A hash function, denoted as \(H\), takes an input \(x\) of arbitrary length and produces an output \(H(x)\) of a fixed length. The process is designed to be easy to compute (hashing the input) but hard to reverse (finding the original input from the hash). This makes hash functions suitable for applications like password storage and data integrity checks."
Describe the properties of a pre-image resistant hash function.,"A hash function \(H\) is considered pre-image resistant if, given a hash value \(y\), it is computationally infeasible to find an input \(x\) such that \(H(x) = y\). In simpler terms, it's extremely difficult to find the original input data if you only have its hash. This property is crucial for security, as it prevents attackers from reconstructing original data from its hash."
Describe the properties of a collision resistant hash function.,"A hash function \(H\) is considered collision resistant if it is computationally infeasible to find two distinct inputs, \(x\) and \(y\), such that \(x \neq y\) and \(H(x) = H(y)\). This means it's very hard to find two different pieces of data that produce the same hash output. Collision resistance is important for ensuring the integrity of data and for preventing certain types of cryptographic attacks."
What are some important hash functions used in cryptography and password hashing?,"Important hash functions include those used in cryptography and those specifically designed for password hashing. For cryptographic purposes, notable examples are SHA-256 and SHA-512, and KECCAK. For password hashing, which requires additional security considerations like resistance to brute-force attacks, commonly used functions include ARGON2 and bcrypt."
Compare and contrast plaintext password storage with hashed/encrypted password storage.,"Plaintext password storage involves storing passwords exactly as they are entered. When a claimant attempts to log in, their entered password is directly compared against the stored plaintext password. This method offers no protection against insiders (like system administrators) or attackers who gain access to the system, making disputes possible. 

Hashed/encrypted password storage involves storing either the encrypted or, more commonly, the hashed version of the passwords. When a claimant logs in, their entered password is first hashed/encrypted and then compared against the stored hashed/encrypted version. This provides some degree of protection against insider threats and attackers, as the original passwords are not stored directly."
Where are password hashes stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are typically stored in specific password files. In Windows systems, these hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at \(%windir%\system32\config\SAM\). In Unix-based systems, historically, they were in the \(/etc/passwd\) file, but in modern Unix/Linux systems, they are stored in a more secure \(shadow\) file located at \(/etc/shadow\)."
Explain the temporary storage of passwords at the application level.,"At the application level, passwords may be temporarily held in intermediate storage locations such as buffers, caches, or even on a web page during processing. It is important not to save passwords in cache. The management of these temporary storage locations is typically beyond the user's control. This means a password might be retained for longer than the user anticipates or intends, potentially increasing the risk of exposure if these locations are compromised."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"In hashed password verification, the verifier (system) does not store the actual passwords but only their hashes. When a claimant (User A) attempts to log in, they provide their password. This password is then passed through a hash function \(h\) to generate a hash, \(h(password)\). This generated hash is then compared to the stored hash for User A in the password table, \(h(password_A)\). If the two hashes match, the login is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected. This process ensures that the verifier never directly handles or stores the user's actual password."
What is the role of the verifier in hashed password verification?,"In the process of hashed password verification, the verifier (typically the system) plays a crucial role in ensuring security. The verifier's primary responsibility is to store only the hashes of the users' passwords, not the passwords themselves. During a login attempt, the verifier takes the password provided by the claimant, hashes it using the same function used during storage, and then compares this newly generated hash with the stored hash. This prevents the verifier from ever being in possession of the user's actual password, thereby mitigating risks associated with password breaches."
Explain the concept of 'what you know' as a basis for authentication.,"'What you know' refers to a type of secret used as a basis for authentication where the claimant proves their identity by demonstrating knowledge of information that is exclusively known to them. Common examples of 'what you know' secrets include passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or answers to security questions. This method relies on the secrecy and memorization of specific data."
Explain the concept of 'what you possess' as a basis for authentication.,"'What you possess' refers to a type of secret used as a basis for authentication where the claimant proves their identity by presenting a physical item that they exclusively own or control. Examples of 'what you possess' secrets include hardware security tokens, smart cards, or mobile phones that can receive one-time passcodes. This method relies on the physical possession of a unique item."
Explain the concept of 'what you are' as a basis for authentication.,"'What you are' refers to a type of secret used as a basis for authentication where the claimant proves their identity by utilizing their unique biological or behavioral characteristics. These are commonly known as biometrics. Examples include fingerprints, facial recognition patterns, iris scans, or voiceprints. This method relies on the inherent and unique physical or behavioral traits of an individual."
Analyze password-related techniques with respect to password storage.,"Password-related techniques encompass various methods for handling passwords, including how they are stored. Password storage can be categorized as plaintext (insecure), encrypted (fairly secure), or hashed (most secure). Hashing is preferred because it transforms the password into a fixed-length string that is difficult to reverse, thus safeguarding it. Plaintext storage is highly discouraged due to its vulnerability. Encrypted storage offers a moderate level of security, but its effectiveness depends on the encryption strength and key management."
Analyze password-related techniques with respect to password policies.,"Password-related techniques include the implementation of password policies. These policies dictate the rules for password creation and management, such as the minimum length, character types required (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and the frequency of password changes. They also often specify the number of failed login attempts permitted before an account is temporarily locked. These policies aim to enforce the use of stronger passwords and mitigate brute-force attacks."
Analyze password-related techniques with respect to salting.,"Salting is a crucial password-related technique that enhances password security during storage. It involves adding a unique, random string of data (the salt) to each password before it is hashed. This means that even if two users share the same password, their stored hashes will be different because each will have a unique salt. The primary purpose of salting is to defend against dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks, making it significantly harder for attackers to crack passwords."
Analyze password-related techniques with respect to alternative forms of passwords.,"Alternative forms of passwords are part of password-related techniques designed to offer different approaches to authentication. These include passphrases, which are longer and potentially easier to remember than complex passwords; one-time passwords (OTPs), which are time-sensitive and used for a single session; and visual passwords, which involve selecting images or patterns. These alternatives aim to improve both security and usability."
Explain the concept of 'mutual authentication' in the context of strong authentication.,"Mutual authentication is a key component of strong authentication where both parties involved in a communication exchange actively verify each other's identities. Instead of one party simply verifying the other (unilateral authentication), both the claimant and the verifier take turns proving their identity. This ensures that both entities are who they claim to be before any sensitive information is exchanged or actions are performed."
Describe 'challenge-response protocols' in the context of strong authentication.,"Challenge-response protocols are a mechanism used in strong authentication to prove knowledge of shared secrets without revealing the secrets themselves. In this process, one party (the challenger) sends a random challenge to the other party (the responder). The responder then uses a secret they share with the challenger to compute a response to this challenge. The challenger verifies this response. This sequence of challenge and response allows for verification of identity based on shared secrets, often employing techniques like zero-knowledge proofs."
What are 'zero knowledge proofs' in the context of authentication?,"Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic method used in authentication, particularly within challenge-response protocols, that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a certain piece of information, without revealing any information about the knowledge itself beyond the fact that they possess it. In essence, the verifier learns nothing except that the statement is true. This is a powerful technique for proving knowledge of a secret without disclosing the secret."
Analyze the security implications of storing passwords in plaintext.,"Storing passwords in plaintext presents severe security risks. When passwords are stored in plaintext, they are stored exactly as the user entered them. This means that if an attacker gains access to the database or system where these passwords are stored, they will have direct access to all user credentials. There is no protection against insider threats, such as a malicious system administrator, or external attackers who compromise the system. Consequently, this method makes disputes possible, as compromised accounts can be easily misused."
Analyze the security implications of storing hashed or encrypted passwords.,"Storing hashed or encrypted passwords offers a significant improvement in security compared to plaintext storage. In this method, only the transformed version of the password (either encrypted or, more commonly, hashed) is stored. When a user attempts to log in, their provided password is transformed using the same method, and the result is compared to the stored value. This approach provides some degree of protection against insider threats and attackers because the original passwords are not directly accessible. Even if the stored hashes are compromised, recovering the original passwords is much more difficult, especially when strong hashing algorithms and salting are used."
What is the significance of 'No protection against insider (system admin) or an attacker who gains access to the system' in plaintext password storage?,"The statement 'No protection against insider (system admin) or an attacker who gains access to the system' highlights a critical vulnerability of plaintext password storage. It means that if a system administrator, who has privileged access, or any attacker who manages to breach the system's security, gains access to the stored passwords, they can read them directly. This lack of protection means that user accounts are completely exposed to misuse, unauthorized access, and data breaches originating from within or from external compromises."
Explain why 'dispute is possible' with plaintext password storage.,"Dispute is possible with plaintext password storage because the direct visibility of passwords to administrators and attackers means that it is difficult to definitively prove who accessed or misused an account. If an account is compromised, and the passwords are in plaintext, it's hard to determine whether the compromise was due to an external attack, an insider action, or even a user error that was then exploited. This ambiguity can lead to disputes regarding accountability and the origin of unauthorized activities."
What does it mean for a hash function to be 'computationally infeasible'?,"When a hash function is described as 'computationally infeasible' to reverse or to find collisions, it means that performing such an operation would require an unreasonable amount of computational resources (time, processing power, or memory) to be practical. For all intents and purposes, it is considered impossible to achieve within a realistic timeframe using current or foreseeable technology. This infeasibility is the cornerstone of cryptographic security for hash functions."
Explain the concept of 'arbitrary length' input for a hash function.,"A hash function taking an input of 'arbitrary length' means that it can accept data of any size as input. Whether the input is a single character, a short sentence, a large document, or even a multimedia file, the hash function can process it. This flexibility is essential because the data being hashed can vary greatly in size, and the hash function needs to be able to handle all possibilities without limitations on the input data's length."
Explain the concept of 'fixed length' output for a hash function.,"A hash function producing an output of 'fixed length' means that regardless of the size of the input data, the resulting hash value will always be the same length. For example, a hash function might always produce a 256-bit output. This consistency in output length is crucial for many cryptographic applications, as it allows for predictable storage and comparison of hash values, simplifying data management and verification processes."
What is the primary function of salts in password security?,"The primary function of salts in password security is to defend against dictionary attacks. By adding a unique, random salt to each password before hashing, the resulting hash is made unique, even for identical passwords. This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables of hashes (like rainbow tables) or common password lists to quickly identify passwords, as each salted hash will be different and specific to the individual user."
How are salts used to safeguard passwords in storage?,"Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage by ensuring that each password's hash is unique. When a password is submitted for storage, a random salt is generated and combined with the password. This combined data is then processed by a one-way hash function. The salt itself is typically stored alongside the hash. During verification, the stored salt is retrieved and combined with the entered password before hashing, allowing for a correct comparison. This process makes it significantly harder for attackers to crack passwords, even if they obtain the stored hashes."
What are the implications of storing passwords in intermediate storage locations like buffers or caches?,"Storing passwords in intermediate locations like buffers or caches, even temporarily, carries significant risks. These locations are often not as securely managed as primary storage and can be more vulnerable to access by attackers or even accidental exposure. Furthermore, the management of these locations is typically beyond the user's control, meaning passwords might be retained longer than intended. This increases the window of opportunity for compromise and unauthorized access to user accounts."
Explain the difference between 'Plaintext (BAD)' and 'Hashed (good)' password storage.,"The difference between 'Plaintext (BAD)' and 'Hashed (good)' password storage lies in their security. In plaintext storage, passwords are saved as is, making them directly readable and highly vulnerable to compromise. In hashed storage, passwords are transformed into a one-way, fixed-length string using a hash function. This process is difficult to reverse, meaning that even if the stored hashes are accessed, the original passwords cannot be easily determined, providing a much higher level of security."
What is the role of a 'claimant' in authentication?,"In authentication, a 'claimant' is the entity that is attempting to prove its identity to another entity. The claimant presents credentials or information to the verifier to establish that they are who they claim to be. For example, when you log into a website, you are the claimant, and the website's server is the verifier."
What is the role of a 'verifier' in authentication?,"In authentication, a 'verifier' is the entity that is responsible for confirming the identity of another entity, known as the claimant. The verifier receives credentials or information from the claimant and checks them against a trusted source or established criteria to determine if the claimant's identity is valid. In many systems, the verifier is the server or the security system itself."
Describe the security benefits of using 'hashed/encrypted passwords' over 'plaintext' passwords.,"The primary security benefit of using hashed/encrypted passwords over plaintext passwords is the protection of the original credentials. While plaintext passwords are stored in their readable form, making them easily accessible to attackers or insiders, hashed/encrypted passwords are stored in a transformed state. This means that even if the storage is compromised, the attacker does not gain direct access to the user's actual passwords. Recovering the original passwords from their hashes or encrypted forms is computationally intensive and often infeasible, thus significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and account misuse."
What are the potential risks associated with 'password hashes stored in a password file'?,"The potential risks associated with password hashes stored in a password file arise if the file itself is compromised. While hashes are more secure than plaintext passwords, they are not entirely immune to attack. If an attacker gains access to the password file, they can attempt to crack the hashes using various techniques, such as brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks, especially if weak hashing algorithms, short passwords, or no salting were used. Therefore, securing the password file itself is critical."
Explain the security implications of passwords being held temporarily in buffers or caches.,"Passwords held temporarily in buffers or caches pose a security risk because these locations can be more susceptible to unauthorized access than permanent storage. If a system is compromised, an attacker might be able to extract passwords from these transient memory areas. Additionally, the management of these temporary storage locations is often outside the user's direct control, meaning passwords could persist longer than expected, increasing the duration of exposure if a breach occurs."
What is the significance of the statement 'the management of these storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user' regarding temporary password storage?,"The statement 'the management of these storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user' signifies that users have limited ability to influence how long their passwords are retained in temporary storage like buffers or caches. This lack of user control means that passwords might be kept for extended periods, increasing the risk of exposure if these locations are compromised. Users cannot actively clear these temporary stores to mitigate potential security risks."
"How does the verifier ensure security by not storing passwords, only their hashes?","The verifier ensures security by not storing passwords and instead storing only their hashes through a process of cryptographic transformation. When a user sets a password, the system hashes it and stores this hash. During login, the user's entered password is re-hashed using the same algorithm and salt (if used), and this new hash is compared to the stored hash. This prevents the verifier from ever having access to the user's actual password, meaning that even if the verifier's database is breached, the attackers will only obtain hashes, which are significantly harder to reverse into actual passwords."
What is the outcome if the generated hash of a password matches the stored hash during verification?,"If the generated hash of a password matches the stored hash during the verification process, the system accepts the login attempt. This indicates that the password provided by the claimant is correct, as it produces the same hash as the one originally stored for that user. Consequently, the claimant is granted access."
What is the outcome if the generated hash of a password does not match the stored hash during verification?,"If the generated hash of a password does not match the stored hash during the verification process, the system rejects the login attempt. This signifies that the password provided by the claimant is incorrect, as it does not produce the same hash as the one stored for that user. Consequently, the claimant is denied access."
Analyze the concept of 'password storage security' with respect to cryptographic constructs.,"Password storage security relies heavily on cryptographic constructs, most notably the concept of a 'one-way function.' A one-way function is easy to compute in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse. Hash functions are a prime example of one-way functions used in password storage. By hashing passwords, systems can store a representation that is hard to decipher back into the original password, thereby enhancing security against unauthorized access."
What are the key differences between 'fair' encrypted password storage and 'good' hashed password storage?,"The key difference lies in the reversibility and security strength. 'Encrypted' password storage involves using an encryption algorithm, which is theoretically reversible if the decryption key is known. While offering some protection, its security depends heavily on the encryption strength and key management. 'Hashed' password storage, on the other hand, uses a one-way function that is computationally infeasible to reverse. This makes hashed storage generally more secure because even if the stored hashes are obtained, recovering the original passwords is significantly more difficult than decrypting them."
Explain the purpose of imposing rules on the 'selection of passwords' by users.,"The purpose of imposing rules on the selection of passwords by users is to enhance overall account security. These rules, which form part of password policies, typically mandate characteristics such as minimum length, the inclusion of different character types (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and sometimes prohibit common or easily guessable words. By enforcing these rules, systems encourage users to create stronger, more complex passwords that are harder for attackers to guess or crack through brute-force methods."
What is the role of 'number of failed attempts' in password policies?,"The 'number of failed attempts' is a critical parameter within password policies designed to prevent brute-force attacks. This policy dictates how many times a user can incorrectly enter their password before the system takes action, such as temporarily locking the account or requiring additional verification. By limiting the number of attempts, it becomes computationally infeasible for an attacker to systematically try every possible password combination within a reasonable timeframe."
