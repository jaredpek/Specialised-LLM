What are the fundamental bases of authentication?,"The fundamental bases of authentication are categorized into three main types: what you know, what you possess, and what you are."
Describe the concept of password-related techniques.,"Password-related techniques encompass various methods and strategies associated with the creation, storage, and verification of passwords. This includes how passwords are stored (e.g., plaintext, encrypted, or hashed), the policies that govern their selection and usage, the practice of salting passwords, and alternative forms of passwords such as passphrases, one-time passwords, and visual passwords."
Explain the concept of attacks on passwords and defense mechanisms.,"Attacks on passwords refer to methods employed by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to systems or data by compromising user passwords. Defense mechanisms are the strategies and technologies implemented to prevent or mitigate these attacks. This can involve secure password storage, strong password policies, and the use of cryptographic techniques."
Define authentication tokens and biometrics.,"Authentication tokens are physical or digital devices that generate a unique code or signal to verify a user's identity. Biometrics, on the other hand, are unique biological or behavioral characteristics used for authentication, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice patterns."
What is the difference between weak/simple authentication and strong authentication?,"Weak/simple authentication is typically password-based and unilateral, where one entity (the claimant) proves its identity to the verifier. This often involves proving knowledge of a secret by revealing it. Strong authentication, in contrast, involves mutual authentication, where both parties act as claimant and verifier. It also utilizes challenge-response protocols, which allow for proving knowledge of shared secrets without revealing the secret itself, often through zero-knowledge proofs."
Explain password-based authentication.,"Password-based authentication is a method where a user proves their identity by providing a secret password. This is a form of weak or simple authentication, where one entity, the claimant, proves its identity to a verifier. The core mechanism involves the claimant proving knowledge of a secret, which is the password."
Define unilateral authentication.,"Unilateral authentication is a process where one entity, referred to as the claimant, proves its identity to another entity, known as the verifier. This is a characteristic of weak or simple authentication methods."
What does it mean to 'prove knowledge of secret by giving up the secret'?,"To 'prove knowledge of secret by giving up the secret' means that in order to demonstrate that you know a secret, you must reveal the secret itself. This is a common characteristic of weak or simple authentication methods, such as traditional password-based systems."
Describe mutual authentication.,Mutual authentication is a process where both parties involved in an interaction take on the roles of both claimant and verifier. This means that each party proves its identity to the other. It is a key component of strong authentication.
What are challenge-response protocols in authentication?,"Challenge-response protocols are a sequence of steps used in authentication to prove knowledge of shared secrets. In this method, one party (the verifier) issues a challenge, and the other party (the claimant) responds by using the shared secret to compute a response. This allows for proving knowledge of the secret without directly revealing it, which is a feature of strong authentication."
Explain the concept of proving knowledge of a secret without giving up the secret.,"Proving knowledge of a secret without giving up the secret refers to cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, where a party can demonstrate that they possess a secret without revealing any information about the secret itself. This is a hallmark of strong authentication and is often used in challenge-response protocols."
What are zero knowledge proofs in the context of authentication?,"Zero-knowledge proofs are a method used in authentication, particularly within challenge-response protocols, that allows a party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing any information about the secret itself. This is a key aspect of strong authentication."
What are the different methods for password storage?,"Passwords can be stored in several ways: Plaintext (BAD), which means the password is stored as is; 'encrypted' (fair), where the password is transformed using an encryption algorithm; or 'hashed' (good), where the password is transformed using a one-way hash function."
Explain password policies.,"Password policies are a set of rules that are imposed on users regarding the selection and usage of passwords. These rules can include requirements for password complexity (e.g., length, character types), the number of failed attempts allowed before an account is locked, and password expiration periods."
What is 'salting' of passwords?,"Salting of passwords is a security measure where random data, known as a salt, is added to a password before it is hashed. This salt is unique for each password and is stored along with the hash. The purpose of salting is to safeguard passwords in storage and to defend against dictionary attacks by ensuring that identical passwords produce different hashes."
What are alternative forms of passwords?,"Alternative forms of passwords include passphrases, which are longer sequences of words; one-time passwords (OTPs), which are valid for a single login session; and visual passwords, which involve selecting images or patterns."
Define salt in the context of password security.,A salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage and their primary function is to defend against dictionary attacks. Each password typically has a unique salt associated with it.
What is the primary function of salts in password security?,"The primary function of salts in password security is to defend against dictionary attacks. By adding a unique random string (the salt) to each password before hashing, identical passwords will produce different hash values, making pre-computed rainbow tables ineffective."
What is a one-way function?,"A one-way function, denoted as f, is a mathematical function that is relatively easy to compute in one direction but computationally hard to reverse. This means that given an input x, it is easy to compute the output f(x), but given an output y, it is difficult to find an input x such that y = f(x)."
How do hash functions relate to one-way functions?,"Hash functions are a specific type of one-way function. A hash function, denoted as H, takes an input x of arbitrary length and produces an output H(x) of a fixed length. This process is easy to compute but difficult to reverse, fitting the definition of a one-way function."
Explain the properties of a hash function.,A hash function H is considered to have two key properties: Pre-image resistance and Collision resistance. Pre-image resistance means it is computationally infeasible to find an input x given a hash value y such that H(x) = y. Collision resistance means it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs x and y such that H(x) = H(y).
What does it mean for a hash function to be pre-image resistant?,"A hash function H is pre-image resistant if, given a hash value y, it is computationally infeasible to find an input x such that H(x) = y. This property ensures that it is difficult to determine the original input from its hash."
What does it mean for a hash function to be collision resistant?,"A hash function H is collision resistant if it is computationally infeasible to find a pair of distinct inputs (x, y) such that x is not equal to y, but their hash values are the same, i.e., H(x) = H(y). This property is crucial for the integrity of hashed data."
What are some important hash functions used for cryptography and password hashing?,"Important hash functions include SHA256 and SHA512, which are used for cryptographic purposes. For password hashing, commonly used functions are ARGON2 and bcrypt."
Describe the concept of plaintext password storage.,"Plaintext password storage involves storing passwords exactly as they are entered by the user, without any encryption or hashing. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is compared directly against the stored plaintext password in the database. This method offers no protection against insider threats (like system administrators) or external attackers who gain access to the system, making disputes possible."
Explain the security implications of storing passwords in plaintext.,Storing passwords in plaintext poses significant security risks. It provides no protection against unauthorized access by insiders (such as system administrators) or external attackers who manage to compromise the system. This lack of security can lead to potential disputes and unauthorized use of accounts.
Describe the method of storing hashed or encrypted passwords.,"In this method, passwords are not stored in their original form. Instead, they are either encrypted using an encryption algorithm or, more commonly, hashed using a one-way function. When a user attempts to log in, their provided password is also hashed (and potentially salted), and this resulting hash is then compared against the stored hashed password. This approach offers some degree of protection against insider threats and attackers."
What is the advantage of storing hashed/encrypted passwords over plaintext?,"The advantage of storing hashed or encrypted passwords over plaintext is that it provides a degree of protection against unauthorized access. Even if an attacker gains access to the storage, they will only obtain the hashed or encrypted versions of the passwords, which are significantly harder to reverse into the original passwords compared to plaintext."
Where are password hashes stored in operating systems?,"In operating systems, password hashes are typically stored in a password file. In Windows systems, this is the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file, located at %windir%\system32\config\SAM. In Unix and Linux systems, historically it was in /etc/passwd, but modern systems store them in the more secure shadow file, located at /etc/shadow."
Specify the location of password storage in Windows operating systems.,"In Windows operating systems, password hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file. This file is typically located in the %windir%\system32\config\SAM directory."
Specify the location of password storage in Unix/Linux operating systems.,"In Unix and Linux systems, password hashes are stored in specific files. Historically, the /etc/passwd file was used. However, in modern Unix/Linux systems, password hashes are stored in the more secure /etc/shadow file."
Explain how passwords can be temporarily stored at the application level.,"At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations. These can include buffers, caches, or even web pages. It is generally advised not to save passwords in cache. The management of these temporary storage locations is often beyond the user's control, potentially leading to a password being retained longer than intended."
What are the risks associated with temporary password storage at the application level?,"The risks associated with temporary password storage at the application level include the potential for passwords to be held in insecure locations like buffers or caches. Furthermore, the management of these storage locations is typically beyond the user's control, meaning a password might be kept for longer than the user expects or desires, increasing the window of vulnerability."
Describe the process of hashed password verification.,"In hashed password verification, the verifier (system) does not store the actual passwords but only their hashes. When a claimant provides their password, the verifier applies the same hashing function (and salt, if used) to the provided password to generate a hash. This generated hash is then compared to the stored hash. If they match, the claimant is accepted; otherwise, they are rejected."
What is the role of the verifier in hashed password verification?,"In hashed password verification, the verifier's role is to compare the hash of the password provided by the claimant with the stored hash. The verifier should not store the actual passwords, only their corresponding hashes. This is a crucial security measure."
Explain the diagram illustrating hashed password verification.,"The diagram shows Claimant A interacting with Verifier (system) B. Claimant A provides their password and identity (A). The verifier has a password table containing identities and their corresponding password hashes (e.g., h(password_A) for identity A). The verifier takes the password provided by A, hashes it using function 'h' to get h(password). This computed hash is then compared to the stored hash h(password_A). If they match ('yes'), the claimant is ACCEPTed; otherwise ('no'), they are REJECTed."
What does the 'password table' in the hashed password verification diagram represent?,"The 'password table' in the hashed password verification diagram represents the database maintained by the verifier (system). This table stores user identities and their corresponding password hashes. For example, it might list identity 'A' alongside the hash of their password, denoted as h(password_A)."
How is a password verified when using hashed passwords?,"When using hashed passwords, verification involves the system taking the password submitted by the user, applying the same hashing algorithm (and salt, if applicable) that was used during storage, and then comparing the resulting hash with the stored hash. If the hashes match, the authentication is successful."
What is the significance of the verifier not storing passwords in hashed password verification?,"The significance of the verifier not storing passwords in hashed password verification is a critical security practice. It means that even if the verifier's system is compromised, the attackers will only gain access to the password hashes, not the actual passwords. This significantly reduces the risk of sensitive information being exposed."
What are the three main categories for the basis of authentication?,"The three main categories for the basis of authentication are: what you know, what you possess, and what you are."
What are password-related techniques?,"Password-related techniques refer to the methods and strategies employed in managing passwords, including how they are stored (plaintext, encrypted, or hashed), the policies governing their use, the practice of salting, and alternative password formats like passphrases or visual passwords."
Explain the concept of attacks on passwords and defense mechanisms.,"Attacks on passwords are methods used to compromise user credentials, while defense mechanisms are the security measures implemented to prevent such attacks. This includes secure storage, strong policies, and cryptographic techniques to protect passwords."
What are authentication tokens and biometrics?,"Authentication tokens are security devices or codes used to verify identity, while biometrics are unique biological or behavioral characteristics of an individual, such as fingerprints or facial features, used for authentication."
Contrast weak/simple authentication with strong authentication.,"Weak/simple authentication is typically password-based and unilateral, where one party proves identity by revealing a secret. Strong authentication involves mutual authentication between parties and uses challenge-response protocols to prove knowledge of secrets without revealing them, often employing zero-knowledge proofs."
What is the definition of a one-way function?,"A one-way function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult to reverse. Given an input, computing the output is straightforward, but given an output, finding the original input is computationally infeasible."
How are hash functions related to one-way functions?,"Hash functions are a type of one-way function. They take an input of any length and produce an output of a fixed length, a process that is easy to perform but hard to reverse."
What are the two primary properties of hash functions?,"The two primary properties of hash functions are pre-image resistance and collision resistance. Pre-image resistance means it's hard to find the input given the output, and collision resistance means it's hard to find two different inputs that produce the same output."
What is the difference between storing passwords in plaintext and storing them as hashed/encrypted passwords?,"Storing passwords in plaintext means the actual password is saved, offering no protection against unauthorized access. Storing them as hashed/encrypted passwords means a transformed version is saved, providing a degree of security as the original password is not directly exposed."
