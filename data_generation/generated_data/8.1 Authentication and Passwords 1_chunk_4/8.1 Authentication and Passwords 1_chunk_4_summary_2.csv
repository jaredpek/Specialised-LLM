Summarize the methods hackers use to crack passwords.,"Hackers employ several methods to crack passwords. They do not typically try various combinations directly on applications. Instead, they often ""sniff"" and extract ""password hashes"" from the internet as users log in. Systems commonly use standard hash functions. Hackers also utilize password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords, allowing them to crack passwords ""offline."" These programs often determine a significant percentage of usernames and passwords in a system. Furthermore, hackers store extracted password hashes in dictionaries, and if a user's password hash appears in such a dictionary, it is considered compromised."
Explain how password cracking programs work and their effectiveness.,"Password cracking programs are tools used by attackers to gain access to accounts. These programs attempt numerous common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. They can be highly effective, capable of determining 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords within a system. To gain access to a system, an attacker typically only needs one valid username and password combination. Passwords are generally easy to crack unless users are compelled to choose passwords that are difficult for these programs to guess."
Describe the risks associated with password reuse and how hackers exploit it.,"A significant disadvantage of password security systems is the need for users to reuse passwords when logging into a system multiple times. This practice provides attackers with numerous opportunities to ""listen in"" on the password. If an attacker can successfully ""listen in"" on a password even once, they can then log in as the user until the password is next changed. This vulnerability is exacerbated if a ""keylogger,"" a device that records keystrokes, is installed on the user's computer."
Explain the concept of a one-time password (OTP) system and its benefits.,"A one-time password (OTP) system is a security measure that forces a user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the security risks associated with using the same password multiple times. The basic idea behind OTP systems transitions from ""something you know"" (like a traditional password) to ""something you have."""
Describe how OTPs are delivered and the importance of safeguarding the delivery method.,"Historically, One-Time Passwords (OTPs) were sent to a user's bank token when attempting to access a bank account. Currently, banks commonly send OTPs to a user's handphone. It is crucial for users not to lose their handphone, as it is the delivery method for these time-sensitive passwords."
What are the general methods of user authentication based on possession?,"A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user possesses. This category includes several types of items: OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
"Explain how OTP products, like SecurID cards, function for user authentication.","OTP products generate a new password each time a user logs in. A specific example is the SecurID card from RSA Security. This card is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user needs to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server. The server is aware of the algorithm the SecurID card uses to generate passwords and can verify the password entered by the user."
Describe variations of OTP systems beyond the SecurID card.,"There are other variations of OTP systems. For instance, some OTP systems generate passwords for users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. Traditionally, OTP systems required users to carry separate devices. However, these systems are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
Summarize the primary ways hackers attempt to compromise passwords.,"Hackers primarily attempt to compromise passwords by sniffing and extracting ""password hashes"" from internet traffic during user logins. They also leverage password cracking programs that utilize dictionaries of common passwords for offline attacks. Storing these password hashes in dictionaries is another key tactic, as a match can immediately compromise a user's account."
What is a 'password hash' and how is it used by hackers?,"A ""password hash"" is a one-way cryptographic function that converts a password into a fixed-size string of characters. Systems use hash functions to store passwords securely, as the original password cannot be easily recovered from the hash. Hackers extract these password hashes from internet traffic or system databases. They then use password cracking programs or pre-compiled dictionaries of hashes to find the original password that corresponds to the stolen hash."
Explain the concept of 'offline cracking' in the context of password security.,"'Offline cracking' refers to the process where a hacker attempts to crack passwords without direct interaction with the target system's authentication server. This is typically done by obtaining password hashes (e.g., through data breaches or sniffing network traffic) and then using specialized software on their own computer to try and guess the original passwords. This method is often more efficient and less detectable than attempting to brute-force passwords directly against a live system."
What is a 'keylogger' and how does it pose a threat to password security?,"A 'keylogger' is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on their computer. This allows an attacker to capture sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, as the user types them. If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, an attacker can obtain their login credentials without the user's knowledge, enabling them to access accounts and systems."
Describe the security implications of a user's password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary.,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hacker has a pre-computed or captured hash that matches the user's. This is a critical security breach, as it allows the hacker to directly determine the user's password or use the hash to authenticate as the user without needing to crack it further. The document states that in such a scenario, the user is effectively 'toast,' indicating a complete compromise of their account security."
How do password cracking programs determine usernames and passwords in a system?,"Password cracking programs determine usernames and passwords by systematically trying common login names and various combinations of common words as passwords. These programs are designed to automate the process of guessing credentials. They can efficiently test a large number of possibilities, often leading to the successful identification of 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords present in a targeted system."
What is the minimum requirement for an attacker to gain access to a system?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password combination. This highlights the importance of strong, unique credentials for each account, as a single compromised pair can grant an attacker entry."
Under what condition are passwords considered easy to crack?,Passwords are considered relatively easy to crack unless users are somehow compelled to choose passwords that are difficult for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that weak or predictable passwords are highly vulnerable to automated attacks.
Explain the concept of 'listening in' on a password.,"'Listening in' on a password refers to an attacker intercepting or capturing a user's password as it is transmitted or entered. This can happen through various means, such as network sniffing or the use of keyloggers. Once an attacker has successfully 'listened in' on a password, they can use it to log into the user's account until the password is changed."
What is the consequence of an attacker successfully 'listening in' on a password?,"If an attacker successfully 'listens in' on a password, they can then log in as the user. This unauthorized access persists until the user next changes their password. This underscores the critical need to protect passwords during transmission and entry."
What is an OTP system and how does it differ from traditional passwords?,"An OTP (One-Time Password) system is a security mechanism where a user is required to enter a new, unique password for each login session. This contrasts with traditional password systems where the same password is used repeatedly. The primary benefit of an OTP system is that it eliminates the security risks associated with password reuse."
How does an OTP system relate to the concepts of 'something you know' and 'something you have'?,"The concept of an OTP system bridges the gap between 'something you know' and 'something you have.' Traditional passwords fall under 'something you know.' OTP systems, by requiring a unique code generated by a device or sent to a user's phone, introduce the element of 'something you have,' thereby enhancing security."
Describe the historical method of OTP delivery for bank accounts.,"In the past, One-Time Passwords (OTPs) were typically sent to a user's bank token. This token was a physical device that generated or displayed the OTP when the user attempted to access their bank account, serving as a form of multi-factor authentication."
What is the current common method for delivering OTPs for bank accounts?,"Currently, banks commonly send One-Time Passwords (OTPs) to a user's handphone. This means the user receives the OTP via SMS or a similar mobile messaging service, which they then use to authenticate their access to banking services."
What is the critical advice given regarding handphones and OTPs?,"The critical advice given regarding handphones and OTPs is: 'Don't lose your handphone!' Since handphones are now the common delivery method for OTPs, losing one's phone could lead to unauthorized access to accounts if the phone is compromised or if the attacker can intercept messages."
What is the second general method of user authentication mentioned?,The second general method of user authentication discussed is based on something that the user 'has.' This category encompasses physical items or devices that the user possesses and uses to prove their identity.
List examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have'.,"Examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have' include: OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These items are physical possessions used to verify a user's identity."
How do OTP Cards function in the authentication process?,"OTP Cards, such as the SecurID card, are devices that generate a new password each time a user logs in. The card displays a password that changes periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds). When prompted by a server, the user enters the displayed number from the card to authenticate their identity."
What role does RSA Security's SecurID card play in OTP systems?,RSA Security's SecurID card is presented as a specific product example of an OTP card. It functions as a device that generates and displays a new password to the user periodically. This generated password is then used by the user to log into a computer system when prompted by the server.
How does the server verify the password generated by a SecurID card?,The server verifies the password generated by a SecurID card because it knows the specific algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate its passwords. This shared knowledge allows the server to independently calculate the expected password for a given time and compare it with the password entered by the user.
Describe a variation of OTP systems that involves a PIN.,"One variation of OTP systems involves generating passwords for users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. In this scenario, the PIN acts as a prerequisite or a component of the authentication process, alongside the OTP generated by the system."
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of the devices used?,"OTP systems have evolved from traditionally requiring users to carry separate, dedicated devices. Now, these OTP functionalities are sometimes integrated into more common personal devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, making them more convenient for users."
Summarize the main strategies hackers use to obtain passwords.,"Hackers primarily obtain passwords through two main strategies: intercepting password hashes transmitted over the internet as users log in, and using password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords for offline attacks. They also store these hashes in dictionaries for quick access."
What is the significance of 'common standard hash functions' in password cracking?,"'Common standard hash functions' are significant because they are predictable and widely used. Hackers can leverage their knowledge of these standard algorithms to efficiently crack password hashes they have intercepted or stolen. If systems used more robust and varied hashing methods, cracking would be considerably more difficult."
Explain the difference between trying passwords on applications versus sniffing hashes.,"Trying passwords directly on applications involves repeatedly entering different password combinations into a login form, which can be slow and easily detected by security systems. In contrast, sniffing hashes involves intercepting the encrypted representation of a password ('password hash') as it travels over the internet. Hackers then work on cracking these hashes offline, which is often a more efficient and stealthy method."
What are the limitations of traditional password security systems that hackers exploit?,"Hackers exploit limitations such as password reuse and the predictability of common passwords. When users reuse passwords across multiple systems, a compromise on one system can lead to the compromise of others. Additionally, the reliance on easily guessable passwords makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute-force methods."
How can attackers use common login names and common words to crack passwords?,"Attackers use password-cracking programs that systematically try combinations of common login names (usernames) and common words as passwords. These programs are effective because many users choose passwords that are simple, predictable, or related to their personal information, making them susceptible to such automated guessing attempts."
What does it mean for a user to be 'toast' in the context of password security?,"In the context of password security, being 'toast' means that a user's account or credentials have been completely compromised and their password is known or easily discoverable by an attacker. This typically occurs when their password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary or when their password has been successfully cracked."
Describe the role of a 'dictionary' in password cracking.,"A 'dictionary' in password cracking refers to a list of words, phrases, or common password combinations that hackers use. Password cracking programs iterate through this dictionary, attempting to match each entry against a stolen password hash. The effectiveness of the dictionary directly impacts the success rate and speed of the cracking process."
What is the primary goal of an attacker interested in hacking an account?,The primary goal of an attacker interested in hacking an account is to gain unauthorized access. This is typically achieved by obtaining a valid username and password combination that allows them to log into the account and potentially access sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user.
How does the reuse of passwords create opportunities for attackers?,"The reuse of passwords creates opportunities for attackers because if an attacker compromises a password on one system, they can then use that same password to attempt access on other systems the user might be logged into. This significantly expands the potential damage from a single password breach."
What is the fundamental principle behind OTP systems?,"The fundamental principle behind OTP systems is to provide a dynamic, single-use password for each authentication event. This ensures that even if an attacker intercepts a password, it will be invalid for subsequent login attempts, thereby enhancing security compared to static passwords."
Explain the transition from 'something you know' to 'something you have' in authentication.,"The transition from 'something you know' (like a password) to 'something you have' (like an OTP card or a phone) represents an evolution in authentication security. While passwords rely on memorization, 'something you have' relies on possessing a physical item, which is generally harder for an attacker to replicate or steal remotely, thus providing a stronger security layer."
What is a 'bank token' in the context of OTP delivery?,"A 'bank token' was a physical device used in older OTP systems. When a user attempted to access their bank account, the token would generate or display a unique, time-sensitive password (OTP) that the user would then enter to authenticate their identity. It served as a second factor of authentication."
How are Smart Cards and ATM Cards used in authentication?,"Smart Cards and ATM Cards are examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have.' Smart cards typically contain a microchip that stores user data and authentication credentials, requiring physical insertion into a reader. ATM cards are used with a PIN to access bank accounts, combining 'something you have' (the card) with 'something you know' (the PIN)."
What does a SecurID card do periodically?,"A SecurID card periodically flashes a new password to the user. This password changes at regular intervals, typically every 60 seconds or so, ensuring that each password is only valid for a short period."
What information does a user provide when logging in with a SecurID card?,"When logging into a computer system with a SecurID card, the user enters the number displayed on the card at that moment when prompted by the server. This number is the current, time-sensitive password generated by the card."
How do some OTP systems incorporate PINs?,"Some OTP systems incorporate PINs by generating passwords for their users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This means the user must first provide their PIN, and then the system generates or displays the OTP, adding an extra layer of security."
What are the advantages of integrating OTP systems into PDAs and cell phones?,"Integrating OTP systems into PDAs and cell phones offers convenience. Users no longer need to carry separate, dedicated OTP devices. Their existing personal devices can now serve the function of generating or receiving OTPs, streamlining the authentication process."
Summarize the primary vulnerabilities exploited by hackers when targeting passwords.,"Hackers exploit vulnerabilities such as the common practice of password reuse, the use of predictable and easily guessable passwords, and the interception of password hashes during transmission. They also leverage the existence of password cracking programs and pre-compiled dictionaries of common passwords and hashes."
What is the core problem with systems that use common standard hash functions?,The core problem with systems that use common standard hash functions is that these functions are well-understood and often have known weaknesses or are susceptible to brute-force attacks when combined with large dictionaries of potential passwords. This makes it easier for hackers to reverse-engineer or crack the hashes they obtain.
