Define the concept of a password hash.,"A password hash is a transformed version of a password, created using a hash function. This transformation is designed to be one-way, meaning it's computationally infeasible to derive the original password from the hash. Systems use password hashes for security, storing the hash instead of the plain-text password. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is also hashed, and this new hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated."
Explain how hackers commonly extract password hashes.,"Hackers commonly sniff and extract password hashes over the internet as a user logs in. This process involves intercepting the data transmitted during the login process. Once the hash is obtained, it can be used in various cracking methods."
Describe the normal hashing process used by systems.,"Normally, systems use common standard hash functions to create password hashes. These functions are designed to be secure and irreversible, meaning it's difficult to determine the original password from the hash."
What is a password cracking program that uses a dictionary?,A password cracking program that uses a dictionary is a tool that attempts to guess passwords by trying a large list of common words and phrases. These programs can crack passwords offline by systematically testing each word in the dictionary against a stolen password hash.
How do hackers store password hashes for cracking?,Hackers store password hashes in dictionaries. These dictionaries are essentially large lists of pre-computed hashes or common passwords that can be quickly referenced to find a match for a stolen hash.
What is the consequence if a password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hacker has likely found a match for the hash, and the user's account is compromised. In this scenario, the user is considered 'toast,' implying their password has been successfully cracked."
What methods do attackers use to hack into accounts?,Attackers interested in hacking into somebody's account can use password-cracking programs. These programs attempt to guess passwords by trying many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords.
What is the effectiveness of password cracking programs?,Password cracking programs can be quite effective. They can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system by systematically trying common combinations and words.
What is the minimum requirement for an attacker to gain access to a system?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password. Once this pair is discovered, they can often log in."
Under what conditions are passwords easy to crack?,Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that complex and unique passwords are more resistant to cracking.
What is a disadvantage of password security systems related to password reuse?,A disadvantage of password security systems is that a user needs to reuse a password each time they log into a system. This practice gives an attacker numerous opportunities to 'listen in' on the password transmission.
What is a 'keylogger' and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on their computer. If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, it can capture their password as they type it, allowing an attacker to 'listen in' on the password."
What can an attacker do if they successfully 'listen in' on a password?,"If an attacker can successfully 'listen in' on a password, they can then log in as the user. This access remains valid until the user next changes their password."
Describe a one-time password (OTP) system.,"A one-time password (OTP) system forces the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the risks associated with using the same password multiple times, as each login uses a unique credential."
How does an OTP system eliminate password risks?,"An OTP system eliminates the risks of using a password multiple times because it requires the user to enter a new, unique password for each login session. This prevents an attacker from reusing a previously captured password."
What is the transition from 'something you know' to 'something you have' in authentication?,The basic idea of implementing OTP systems naturally leads from the topic of 'something you know' (like a traditional password) to the topic of 'something you have.' This signifies a shift towards authentication methods that rely on possessing a physical item.
How were OTPs historically delivered for bank accounts?,"In the past, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they tried to access their bank account. A bank token is a physical device that generates or displays a one-time password."
How are OTPs delivered to users now?,"Now, banks send OTPs to a user's handphone (mobile phone). This is a more common and convenient method for delivering one-time passwords for authentication."
What is the importance of not losing your handphone in the context of OTPs?,"It is crucial not to lose your handphone because it is now the primary method for receiving OTPs from banks. If you lose your phone, you may be unable to access your bank account, as you won't receive the necessary one-time passwords for authentication."
What is the second general method of authenticating a user?,A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user has. This means the authentication process relies on the user possessing a specific item.
List examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have'.,"Examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have' include OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
What are OTP Cards?,"OTP Cards, or one-time password cards, are a type of authentication token. These products generate a new password each time a user logs in, enhancing security by providing a unique credential for each session."
Provide an example of an OTP product.,"One example of an OTP product is the SecurID card, developed by RSA Security. This card is a device that generates and displays a new password periodically."
Describe the functionality of a SecurID card.,"The SecurID card is a device that flashes a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds or so. When a user wants to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
How does the server verify the password from a SecurID card?,"The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to verify the password that the user enters from the card, ensuring it's a valid, current one-time password."
Are there variations of OTP systems?,"Yes, there are other variations of OTP systems besides the SecurID card. These systems can differ in how they generate or deliver the one-time passwords."
Explain an instance where a PIN is used with an OTP system.,"In some OTP systems, passwords are generated for users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This adds an extra layer of security, requiring both a PIN and the OTP generation process."
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of devices?,"While OTP systems traditionally required users to carry separate, additional devices, they are sometimes now integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. This integration makes OTP more convenient and accessible."
What is the primary function of a password hash?,"The primary function of a password hash is to represent a password in a secure, one-way transformed format. This allows systems to verify passwords without storing the original, plain-text version, thereby protecting against data breaches."
How do hackers attempt to crack passwords using common words?,Hackers attempt to crack passwords by using password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords. These programs systematically try combinations of common words and phrases to match against stolen password hashes.
What is the significance of a password hash being found in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hacker has successfully matched the hash to a known password or a common password pattern. This directly compromises the security of the account associated with that hash."
Explain the concept of 'listening in' on a password.,"'Listening in' on a password refers to an attacker intercepting the password as it is transmitted over a network. This is often achieved through methods like sniffing network traffic or using keyloggers, allowing the attacker to capture the password in real-time."
What is the risk associated with reusing passwords?,"The risk associated with reusing passwords is that if an attacker captures the password during one login session, they can use that same password to access the user's account in subsequent sessions, potentially for an extended period until the password is changed."
How does a keylogger compromise password security?,"A keylogger compromises password security by recording every keystroke the user makes. When a user types their password, the keylogger captures it, providing the attacker with the exact credentials needed to access the account."
What is the purpose of a one-time password (OTP)?,"The purpose of a one-time password (OTP) is to enhance security by providing a unique, time-sensitive credential for each login session. This prevents attackers from using previously captured passwords."
How does an OTP system differ from traditional password systems?,"An OTP system differs from traditional password systems by requiring a new password for each login, whereas traditional systems use a static password that remains the same until changed. This dynamic nature of OTPs significantly increases security."
What is the relationship between OTPs and 'something you have' authentication?,"OTPs are a key component of 'something you have' authentication because they are often delivered via a physical token or a device that the user possesses, such as a bank token, a SecurID card, or a mobile phone."
Describe the evolution of OTP delivery methods.,"OTP delivery methods have evolved from dedicated bank tokens to being sent directly to users' mobile phones. Furthermore, OTP functionality is increasingly being integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones."
What are the main categories of authentication methods based on possession?,"The main categories of authentication methods based on possession are OTP Cards, Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These all rely on the user having a physical item to authenticate."
What is the role of a SecurID card in authentication?,A SecurID card acts as a device that generates a new password periodically. The user then enters this displayed password when prompted by the system to authenticate their identity.
How does a server validate a password generated by a SecurID card?,A server validates a password generated by a SecurID card by using the same algorithm that the card employs. This allows the server to predict and verify the correct one-time password at any given moment.
What is the advantage of integrating OTP into mobile devices?,"The advantage of integrating OTP into mobile devices like smartphones and PDAs is increased convenience and accessibility. Users no longer need to carry a separate token, as their phone can serve the purpose of generating or receiving OTPs."
Explain the concept of 'password hash' in the context of security.,"A password hash is a cryptographic representation of a password. It's created using a one-way function, meaning it's easy to compute the hash from the password but extremely difficult to reverse the process. This is crucial for storing passwords securely, as the original password is never stored directly."
What is the primary technique hackers use to obtain password hashes from users online?,The primary technique hackers use to obtain password hashes from users online is by sniffing and extracting them as the user logs into applications. This involves intercepting the data transmitted over the network during the login process.
Describe the typical hashing function used by systems.,"Typically, systems use common standard hash functions. These are well-established algorithms designed to produce a unique fixed-size output (the hash) for any given input (the password), and are designed to be computationally intensive to reverse."
How do password cracking programs leverage dictionaries?,"Password cracking programs leverage dictionaries by systematically trying every word or phrase in a pre-compiled list (the dictionary) against a target password hash. If a match is found, the original password is revealed."
What is the purpose of storing password hashes in dictionaries by hackers?,"Hackers store password hashes in dictionaries to speed up the cracking process. They can pre-compute hashes for common passwords or store known compromised hashes, allowing for quick lookups when they obtain new hashes."
What does it mean if a password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it signifies that the hacker has found a match for the hash. This means they have likely determined the original password, compromising the user's account."
What is the common approach for attackers to gain initial access to accounts?,"Attackers commonly use password-cracking programs that try numerous common login names and combinations of common words as passwords. This brute-force approach, often aided by dictionaries, aims to guess valid credentials."
What percentage of system credentials can password cracking programs potentially uncover?,"Password cracking programs can potentially uncover a significant portion of system credentials, often determining 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system through their automated guessing methods."
What is the minimum credential requirement for an attacker to access a system?,"The minimum credential requirement for an attacker to access a system is a single valid username and password pair. Once this combination is discovered, the attacker can proceed to gain unauthorized entry."
Under what circumstances are passwords considered vulnerable to cracking?,"Passwords are considered vulnerable to cracking when users are not compelled to choose passwords that are difficult for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that weak, predictable passwords are much more susceptible."
