Define the concept of a password hash.,"A password hash is a transformed version of a password, created using a hash function. This transformation is designed to be a one-way process, meaning it's computationally infeasible to derive the original password from its hash. Systems use password hashes for security, storing the hash instead of the actual password. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is also hashed, and this new hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated."
Explain how hackers commonly extract password hashes.,Hackers commonly extract password hashes by sniffing and extracting them over the internet as a user logs in. This process involves intercepting network traffic to capture the hashed representation of the password.
What is a common characteristic of hash functions used by normal systems?,"Normally, systems use common standard hash functions to create password hashes."
Describe a method hackers use to crack passwords using dictionaries.,"Hackers write or use password cracking programs that employ a dictionary of common passwords. These programs attempt to match known passwords against captured password hashes, often performing this cracking offline."
How do hackers utilize dictionaries in relation to password hashes?,"Hackers store password hashes in dictionaries. If a user's password hash appears in these dictionaries, it means the password is very weak and easily compromised."
What is the primary method attackers use to hack into accounts?,Attackers interested in hacking into somebody's account can use password-cracking programs. These programs attempt to guess login credentials by trying many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords.
What is the effectiveness of password cracking programs?,Password cracking programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system by trying common login names and word combinations.
What is the minimum requirement for an attacker to gain access to a system?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password."
Under what condition are passwords easy to crack?,Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess.
What is a disadvantage of password security systems related to password reuse?,A disadvantage of password security systems is that a user needs to reuse a password each time they log into a system. This practice gives an attacker numerous opportunities to 'listen in' on the password.
What is a keylogger and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software that can be installed on a user's PC. It records every keystroke made by the user, including passwords, allowing an attacker to capture sensitive information."
What can an attacker do if they successfully 'listen in' on a password?,"If an attacker can successfully 'listen in' on a password, they can then log in as the user. This access remains valid until the user next changes their password."
Define a one-time password (OTP) system.,A one-time password (OTP) system is a security measure where the user is forced to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the risks associated with using the same password multiple times.
How does an OTP system mitigate password risks?,An OTP system mitigates password risks by requiring a new password for each login session. This prevents attackers from exploiting previously compromised or reused passwords.
What is the transition in authentication topics from 'something you know' to 'something you have'?,The basic idea of implementing OTP systems naturally leads from the topic of 'something you know' (like a traditional password) to the topic of 'something you have' (like a device that generates OTPs).
How were OTPs historically delivered for bank accounts?,"In the past, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they tried to access their bank account."
How are OTPs delivered to users by banks now?,"Now, banks send OTPs to a user's handphone (mobile phone)."
What is a critical piece of advice regarding handphones and OTPs?,"It is crucial not to lose your handphone, as it is now the delivery method for OTPs used in banking."
What is the second general method of authenticating a user based on possession?,"A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user possesses, meaning something they have."
List examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have'.,"Examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have' include OTP Cards (one-time password), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
Describe the function of OTP products.,"OTP products generate a new password each time a user logs in. This ensures that each login attempt uses a unique, time-sensitive credential."
What is an example of an OTP product from RSA Security?,"One such OTP product, from RSA Security, is the SecurID card."
Explain how a SecurID card works.,"The SecurID card is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds or so. When a user wants to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the card when prompted by the server."
What role does the server play in the SecurID card system?,The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to verify the password that the user enters from the card.
Describe a variation of OTP systems that involves a PIN.,"For instance, some OTP systems generate passwords for their users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This adds an extra layer of security, requiring both a PIN and the OTP generated by the system."
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of required devices?,"While OTP systems traditionally required users to carry separate devices, they are sometimes now integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
What are the main categories of authentication factors?,"The main categories of authentication factors are something you know (like a password), something you have (like a physical token or device), and something you are (biometrics, though not detailed in this document)."
Explain the concept of 'listening in' by an attacker.,"'Listening in' by an attacker refers to the act of intercepting or capturing sensitive information, such as passwords, as they are transmitted or used. This is often facilitated by methods like sniffing network traffic or using keyloggers."
What is the primary risk of reusing passwords?,"The primary risk of reusing passwords is that if one instance of the password is compromised, all other accounts using the same password become vulnerable to the same attacker."
How can password cracking programs be used offline?,"Password cracking programs can be used offline when an attacker has already obtained a list of password hashes. They can then run the cracking software on their own system without needing to interact with the target system directly, making the process faster and stealthier."
What does it mean if a password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means that the corresponding password is a common or easily guessable one. This makes the user's account highly susceptible to being compromised."
Describe the process of gaining system access using password cracking programs.,"Password cracking programs are used to systematically try various combinations of usernames and passwords, often based on common words and patterns. If a valid combination is found, the attacker gains access to the system."
What is the significance of a single valid username and password for an attacker?,"A single valid username and password is the key that an attacker needs to gain access to a system. Once this pair is discovered, the attacker can potentially compromise the entire system or account."
What makes passwords 'hard to guess' for password cracking programs?,"Passwords are considered 'hard to guess' for password cracking programs when they are complex, unique, and do not follow common patterns or dictionary words. This often involves a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols."
How does a keylogger compromise password security?,"A keylogger compromises password security by recording every keystroke typed by a user. This allows it to capture passwords as they are entered, even if the user is using a strong password, because the keylogger directly obtains the input."
What is the implication of an attacker logging in as 'YOU'?,"If an attacker logs in as 'YOU', it means they have successfully impersonated the legitimate user. They can then perform actions on behalf of that user, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized transactions, or other malicious activities, until the user changes their password."
What is the core principle behind OTP systems?,"The core principle behind OTP systems is to provide a dynamic, single-use password for each authentication event. This ensures that even if an OTP is intercepted, it cannot be reused for subsequent logins."
How does the transition from 'something you know' to 'something you have' apply to OTPs?,"The transition occurs because traditional passwords are 'something you know.' OTP systems, by requiring a physical token or device (like a card or phone) to generate the password, introduce the 'something you have' factor into the authentication process."
What was the historical method of OTP delivery for bank accounts?,"Historically, OTPs for bank accounts were often delivered via a dedicated bank token, a small physical device that generated the one-time password."
What is the current trend in OTP delivery for banking?,"The current trend is for banks to send OTPs directly to a user's handphone (mobile phone), making it a more convenient and widely adopted method."
What are the three listed methods of authentication based on 'something you have'?,"The three listed methods of authentication based on 'something you have' are OTP Cards (one-time password), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
How do OTP products generate new passwords?,OTP products generate a new password each time a user logs in. This is typically achieved through an algorithm that creates a unique code based on a shared secret and the current time or a counter.
"What is the SecurID card, and what does it do?","The SecurID card is an example of an OTP product. It is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically, usually every 60 seconds. This generated password is then used for authentication."
Describe the user interaction with a SecurID card for login.,"When a user wants to log into a computer system using a SecurID card, they are prompted by the server to enter the number currently displayed on the card. This number is the one-time password."
What is the server's role in verifying SecurID card passwords?,"The server possesses the same algorithm used by the SecurID card to generate passwords. It uses this algorithm to calculate the expected password for the current time and compares it with the password entered by the user, thus verifying its authenticity."
Explain an OTP system variation that requires a PIN.,"In some OTP systems, a password is generated only after the user enters a personal identification number (PIN). This means that both the PIN (something you know) and the generated OTP (derived from something you have) are required for authentication."
How have OTP systems adapted to modern technology?,"OTP systems have adapted to modern technology by integrating their functionality into devices that users commonly carry. Instead of requiring separate hardware tokens, OTP generation is now often built into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
What is the primary difference between traditional password cracking and hash-based cracking?,"Traditional password cracking might involve trying to guess passwords directly against an application. Hash-based cracking, as described, involves obtaining password hashes and then using programs with dictionaries or brute-force methods to find the original passwords offline."
What is the implication of a hacker storing password hashes in dictionaries?,"If a hacker stores password hashes in dictionaries, it means they have pre-computed hashes for common passwords. When they encounter a user's hash, they can quickly look it up in their dictionary to find the corresponding password, bypassing the need for real-time cracking."
What is the security benefit of OTP systems over traditional passwords?,"The security benefit of OTP systems over traditional passwords is that each password is used only once. This prevents attackers from reusing compromised passwords for subsequent access, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized entry."
