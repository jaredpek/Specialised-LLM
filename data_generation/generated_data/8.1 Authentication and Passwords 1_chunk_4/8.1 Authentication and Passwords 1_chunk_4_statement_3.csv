Define the concept of a password hash.,"A password hash is a transformed version of a password, created using a hash function. This transformation is designed to be one-way, meaning it's computationally infeasible to derive the original password from the hash. Systems use password hashes for security, storing the hash instead of the actual password. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is also hashed, and this new hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated."
Explain how hackers commonly extract password hashes.,"Hackers commonly sniff and extract password hashes over the internet as a user logs in. This process involves intercepting the data transmitted during the login process. Once the hash is obtained, it can be used in various cracking methods."
Describe the role of common hash functions in password security.,"Normally, systems use common standard hash functions to create password hashes. These functions are algorithms that take an input (the password) and produce a fixed-size string of characters (the hash). While standard, the predictability of these functions can be exploited by attackers if the hashes are compromised."
Detail the methods hackers use to crack passwords using dictionaries.,"Hackers write or use password cracking programs that employ a dictionary of common passwords. These programs attempt to match the stolen password hashes against a pre-compiled list of common passwords. If a match is found, the original password is revealed. This process is often performed offline, meaning the attacker doesn't need to be actively connected to the target system."
Explain the significance of password hashes appearing in hacker dictionaries.,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the original password has likely been compromised. This is because the dictionary contains hashes of commonly used or easily guessable passwords. When a hash is found in such a dictionary, it indicates that the password is not secure and the user's account is vulnerable."
Describe how attackers use password-cracking programs.,Attackers interested in hacking into an account can use password-cracking programs. These programs attempt to guess passwords by trying numerous common login names and concatenations of common words. They are designed to automate the process of finding valid username and password combinations.
What is the typical success rate of password cracking programs?,"Password cracking programs can easily determine a significant percentage of usernames and passwords within a system. Specifically, they can often determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system by employing various guessing techniques."
What is the minimum requirement for an attacker to gain system access?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password combination. Once this pair is discovered, the attacker can authenticate and potentially gain unauthorized entry."
Under what conditions are passwords considered easy to crack?,"Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that simple, common, or predictable passwords are more susceptible to cracking attempts."
Explain the disadvantage of password reuse in security systems.,A significant disadvantage of password security systems is when a user needs to reuse the same password each time they log into a system. This practice gives an attacker numerous opportunities to 'listen in' on the login process and potentially capture the password.
What is a keylogger and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on their computer. If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, it can capture passwords as they are typed. This poses a severe security risk, as the attacker can then obtain sensitive login credentials."
What can an attacker do if they successfully 'listen in' on a password?,"If an attacker can successfully 'listen in' on a password, they can then log in as the user. This unauthorized access continues until the user next changes their password. This highlights the critical importance of protecting login credentials from interception."
Describe the function of a one-time password (OTP) system.,"A one-time password (OTP) system forces the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This mechanism eliminates the risks associated with using a password multiple times, as each login attempt uses a unique, temporary password."
How does an OTP system mitigate password risks?,"An OTP system mitigates password risks by ensuring that a new password is used for every login. This prevents attackers from exploiting previously captured passwords, as they become invalid immediately after a single use. It also addresses the vulnerability of password reuse."
What is the transition from 'something you know' to 'something you have' in authentication?,The basic idea of implementing an OTP system naturally leads from the topic of 'something you know' (like a traditional password) to the topic of 'something you have.' This shift signifies a move towards authentication methods that rely on possessing a physical item or device.
How were OTPs historically delivered for bank accounts?,"In the past, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they tried to access their bank account. A bank token is a physical device that generates or displays a one-time password."
How are OTPs delivered to users by banks now?,"Now, banks send OTPs to a user's handphone (mobile phone). This is a more convenient method of delivery compared to dedicated bank tokens."
What is the crucial advice regarding handphones and OTPs?,"The crucial advice regarding handphones and OTPs is: Don't lose your handphone! Since OTPs are now sent to mobile phones, losing the device means losing access to these one-time passwords, which are essential for accessing bank accounts and other services."
What is the second general method of user authentication?,A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user has. This means the authentication process relies on the user possessing a specific item or device.
List examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have'.,"Examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have' include: OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
Describe the functionality of OTP Cards.,"OTP Cards are a type of product that generates a new password each time a user logs in. These cards are designed to provide a dynamic and unique password for each authentication session, enhancing security."
What is the SecurID card and how does it function?,"The SecurID card, a product by RSA Security, is a device that flashes a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds or so. When a user wants to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
How does the server verify passwords generated by SecurID cards?,"The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to independently generate the same sequence of passwords and verify the password that the user enters, ensuring authenticity."
Explain variations of OTP systems.,"There are other variations of OTP systems besides the SecurID card. For instance, some OTP systems generate passwords for their users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. Additionally, while OTP systems traditionally required separate devices, they are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
How can OTP systems be integrated with other devices?,"OTP systems, which traditionally required users to carry separate devices, are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. This integration makes OTP authentication more convenient and accessible."
What is the purpose of a password hash?,The purpose of a password hash is to securely store a representation of a password without storing the actual password itself. This is a security measure to protect user credentials in case of a data breach.
How do hackers attempt to crack passwords offline?,"Hackers attempt to crack passwords offline by using password cracking programs that utilize a dictionary of common passwords. They take a stolen password hash and try to match it against the hashes of common passwords in their dictionary. If a match is found, the original password is revealed."
What is the implication if a password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary, it means the password is very likely a common or easily guessable one. This makes the user's account highly vulnerable to compromise because the attacker can easily determine the original password."
Describe the process of password cracking using common login names and words.,Attackers use password-cracking programs to try many common login names combined with concatenations of common words as potential passwords. This brute-force approach aims to guess valid credentials by systematically testing likely combinations.
What is the typical percentage of credentials that can be compromised by password cracking programs?,Password cracking programs are effective enough to easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords within a system. This indicates a significant vulnerability in systems that rely solely on weak or common passwords.
What is the primary goal of an attacker when trying to access a system?,"The primary goal of an attacker when trying to access a system is to find at least one valid username and password combination. With this single set of credentials, they can typically gain unauthorized access."
What makes passwords vulnerable to cracking?,"Passwords become vulnerable to cracking when users are not compelled to choose passwords that are difficult for password-cracking programs to guess. This means that simple, predictable, or common passwords are more easily cracked."
Explain the security risk of reusing passwords across multiple logins.,"Reusing passwords across multiple logins presents a significant security risk. It provides an attacker with numerous opportunities to 'listen in' on the login process. If the password is intercepted during any of these logins, the attacker can then use it to access all other systems where the same password is used."
How can a keylogger compromise password security?,"A keylogger compromises password security by recording every keystroke made by a user. If a keylogger is installed on a user's computer, it can capture passwords as they are typed, allowing an attacker to obtain these credentials without the user's knowledge."
What is the consequence of an attacker intercepting a password?,"If an attacker successfully intercepts a password, they can then use it to log in as the compromised user. This unauthorized access persists until the user changes their password, potentially leading to data theft or system misuse."
What is the core principle behind a one-time password (OTP) system?,"The core principle behind a one-time password (OTP) system is to generate and use a unique password for each login session. This eliminates the risk associated with using a static password multiple times, as each password is valid only for a single transaction."
How does an OTP system enhance security compared to traditional passwords?,"An OTP system enhances security by ensuring that each login uses a new password. This means that even if an attacker manages to intercept an OTP, it will be useless for subsequent login attempts, thereby preventing unauthorized access through compromised credentials."
What is the relationship between 'something you know' and 'something you have' in authentication?,The concept of 'something you know' (like a password) is often combined with 'something you have' (like a token or phone) in multi-factor authentication. The transition from solely relying on 'something you know' to incorporating 'something you have' is exemplified by the evolution of OTP systems.
Describe the historical method of OTP delivery for banking.,"Historically, for bank accounts, OTPs were delivered via a dedicated bank token. This token was a physical device that the user would use to obtain the one-time password when needed for authentication."
What is the current method of OTP delivery for banking?,"Currently, banks deliver OTPs to users' handphones (mobile phones). This method is more common and convenient than the older system of using separate bank tokens."
Why is it important not to lose your handphone when using OTPs?,"It is important not to lose your handphone when using OTPs because your phone is the delivery mechanism for these one-time passwords. If you lose your phone, you will not receive the OTPs needed to access your accounts, effectively locking you out and potentially compromising your security if the phone falls into the wrong hands."
What are the categories of authentication based on 'something you have'?,"Authentication methods based on 'something you have' include OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These methods rely on the user possessing a physical item to prove their identity."
What is the function of OTP products like SecurID cards?,"OTP products, such as the SecurID card, function by generating a new password each time a user logs in. The SecurID card, for example, displays a new password periodically, which the user then enters to authenticate."
How does a SecurID card generate new passwords?,"A SecurID card generates new passwords by using a specific algorithm. This algorithm produces a new password that changes periodically, typically every 60 seconds, ensuring that each password is only valid for a short duration."
What information does a server need to verify a SecurID card password?,"To verify a SecurID card password, the server needs to know the same algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to calculate the expected password at any given time and compare it with the password entered by the user."
Describe how some OTP systems use a PIN.,"Some OTP systems generate passwords for their users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This adds an extra layer of security, requiring both a PIN (something you know) and the generated OTP (often tied to something you have) for authentication."
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of required devices?,"OTP systems have evolved from traditionally requiring users to carry separate, dedicated devices to now being integrated into more common devices. They are sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, making them more convenient."
What is the primary method hackers use to obtain passwords from systems?,"The primary method hackers use to obtain passwords from systems, as described, is by sniffing and extracting the 'password hash' over the internet as a user logs in. They also employ password cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords."
Explain the concept of 'listening in' on a password.,"'Listening in' on a password refers to an attacker intercepting the password as it is transmitted or entered. This can happen through methods like sniffing network traffic or using keyloggers. Once captured, the attacker can use this password for unauthorized access."
