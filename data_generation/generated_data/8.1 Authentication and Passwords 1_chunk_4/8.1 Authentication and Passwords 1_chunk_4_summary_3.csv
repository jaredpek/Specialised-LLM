Summarize the methods hackers use to crack passwords.,"Hackers employ several methods to crack passwords. They do not typically try various combinations directly on applications. Instead, they often ""sniff"" and extract ""password hashes"" from the internet as users log in. Systems commonly use standard hash functions. Hackers also utilize password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords, allowing them to crack passwords offline. These programs store password hashes in dictionaries, and if a user's password hash is found in such a dictionary, it is considered compromised."
Explain how password-cracking programs work and their effectiveness.,"Password-cracking programs are used by attackers to gain access to accounts. These programs attempt to guess passwords by trying numerous common login names and concatenations of common words. Such programs can successfully determine 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords within a system. To gain access to a system, an attacker typically only needs one valid username and password pair."
Describe the disadvantage of password reuse in security systems.,"A significant disadvantage of traditional password security systems is the need for users to reuse the same password each time they log into a system. This practice provides attackers with numerous opportunities to ""listen in"" on the password. If an attacker can successfully intercept a password even once, they can then log in as that user until the password is changed."
What is a keylogger and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that is installed on a user's personal computer (PC). Its function is to record every keystroke made by the user. This information is then transmitted to an attacker. If a keylogger is installed, an attacker can capture a user's password as they type it, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts."
Explain the concept of a one-time password (OTP) system.,"A one-time password (OTP) system is a security measure that forces a user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the risk associated with using the same password multiple times. The basic idea behind OTP systems transitions from ""something you know"" (like a traditional password) to ""something you have."""
"How are OTPs delivered to users, and what is a critical precaution?","Historically, One-Time Passwords (OTPs) were sent to a user's bank token when they attempted to access their bank account. Currently, banks commonly send OTPs to a user's handphone. A critical precaution for users is to not lose their handphone, as it is essential for receiving these one-time passwords."
What are the general methods of user authentication based on possession?,"A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user possesses, i.e., something the user has. Examples of authentication methods based on possession include OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
"Describe how OTP products, like SecurID cards, function.","One-time password (OTP) products are designed to generate a new password each time a user logs in. A specific example is the SecurID card from RSA Security. This card is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user needs to log into a computer system, they enter the number shown on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
Explain the server's role in verifying passwords generated by SecurID cards.,The server plays a crucial role in verifying passwords generated by devices like the SecurID card. The server possesses the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate its passwords. This allows the server to verify the accuracy of the password entered by the user.
What are some variations of OTP systems?,"There are several variations of One-Time Password (OTP) systems. In some OTP systems, passwords are generated for users only after they enter a personal identification number (PIN). Additionally, while OTP systems traditionally required users to carry separate devices, they are now often integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
Summarize the primary ways hackers attempt to compromise passwords.,"Hackers primarily attempt to compromise passwords by sniffing and extracting ""password hashes"" from network traffic during user logins. They also leverage password cracking programs that utilize dictionaries of common passwords to perform offline attacks. Storing these password hashes in dictionaries allows for quick identification if a user's hash is present."
What is a 'password hash' and how is it used by hackers?,"A ""password hash"" is a one-way cryptographic function that converts a password into a fixed-size string of characters. Hackers extract these hashes from network traffic or databases. They then use password cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords to try and reverse the hashing process, effectively cracking the original password. If a user's password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary, their password is compromised."
Describe the limitations of traditional password security and the risks of reuse.,"A significant limitation of traditional password security is the user's tendency to reuse passwords across multiple systems. This practice creates a vulnerability because if an attacker obtains a password hash from one system, they can potentially use it to access other accounts belonging to the same user. This reuse provides attackers with numerous opportunities to exploit compromised credentials."
How can password cracking programs determine a significant percentage of user credentials?,"Password cracking programs can determine a significant percentage of user credentials by employing sophisticated techniques. They systematically try common login names and combine them with common words or phrases to form potential passwords. This brute-force approach, combined with dictionary attacks, allows these programs to efficiently guess and validate a substantial portion of usernames and passwords within a system."
What is the core principle behind a one-time password (OTP) system?,"The core principle behind a one-time password (OTP) system is to enhance security by ensuring that each login attempt uses a unique password. This eliminates the risk associated with reusing passwords. OTP systems shift the authentication factor from solely ""something you know"" to incorporating ""something you have."""
Explain the evolution of OTP delivery methods.,"The delivery method for One-Time Passwords (OTPs) has evolved over time. Initially, OTPs were often sent to dedicated bank tokens. More recently, the common practice has shifted to sending OTPs directly to a user's handphone. This change makes the mobile phone a critical component in the authentication process."
What are the different categories of authentication based on possession?,"Authentication methods based on possession, meaning something the user has, can be categorized into several types. These include OTP Cards, which generate one-time passwords; Smart Cards, which store digital information and can perform cryptographic operations; and ATM Cards, which are used for financial transactions and require physical possession."
Detail the functionality of a SecurID card in password generation and verification.,"A SecurID card is a device that generates a new password for the user each time they log in. It displays a password that changes periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user needs to authenticate, they enter the currently displayed password from the card. The server, which knows the algorithm used by the SecurID card, can then verify the entered password."
How do some OTP systems incorporate PINs for password generation?,"Some variations of One-Time Password (OTP) systems integrate a Personal Identification Number (PIN) into the password generation process. In these systems, the OTP is generated for the user only after they successfully enter their PIN. This adds an extra layer of security, requiring both knowledge of the PIN and possession of the OTP generating mechanism."
What are the modern integrations of OTP systems?,"While OTP systems traditionally required users to carry separate physical devices, modern implementations have seen these systems integrated into more convenient devices. Specifically, OTP functionalities are now often incorporated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, making them more accessible and less cumbersome for users."
Describe the common methods hackers use to obtain password hashes.,"Hackers commonly obtain password hashes through network sniffing, which involves intercepting data transmitted over a network, particularly during user login processes. They also extract these hashes from databases or systems that store them. Once obtained, these hashes are then used in conjunction with password cracking techniques."
What is the significance of a password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hacker has a pre-computed hash that matches the user's. This is a critical security breach, as it directly indicates that the hacker can likely determine the user's original password using the same hashing algorithm. The phrase ""you are toast!"" emphasizes the severe vulnerability this represents."
Explain the concept of 'listening in' on a password and its implications.,"'Listening in' on a password refers to an attacker intercepting the password as it is transmitted or entered. This can occur through various means, such as network sniffing or the use of keyloggers. If an attacker successfully 'listens in' on a password, they can use it to log into the user's account, impersonating them until the password is changed."
How do password cracking programs exploit common words?,"Password cracking programs exploit common words by using them as components in their guessing algorithms. They create potential passwords by concatenating common words together or by using common words as the basis for brute-force attempts. This strategy is effective because many users choose passwords that are easy to remember, often incorporating dictionary words."
What is the primary goal of an attacker when using password cracking programs?,The primary goal of an attacker when using password cracking programs is to gain unauthorized access to a system. These programs help them achieve this by efficiently guessing a large number of potential passwords. The ultimate objective is to find at least one valid username and password combination that grants them entry.
What makes passwords 'hard to guess' for password-cracking programs?,"Passwords become 'hard to guess' for password-cracking programs when they are not based on common words, predictable patterns, or easily obtainable information. This typically involves using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoiding personal information or sequential patterns. Users being 'forced' to choose such complex passwords significantly increases their security."
How does a one-time password (OTP) system mitigate the risks of password reuse?,"A one-time password (OTP) system mitigates the risks of password reuse by ensuring that each login session requires a unique password. Since a new password is generated for every login, even if an attacker intercepts one password, it becomes useless for subsequent login attempts. This fundamentally eliminates the vulnerability associated with reusing credentials."
What is the transition in authentication factors from traditional passwords to OTPs?,"The transition in authentication factors from traditional passwords to OTPs involves moving from ""something you know"" to incorporating ""something you have."" Traditional passwords rely solely on the user's knowledge. OTP systems, however, require the user to possess a device or token that generates the one-time password, adding a second factor of authentication."
What was the historical method of OTP delivery for bank accounts?,"Historically, for bank accounts, One-Time Passwords (OTPs) were typically sent to a user's bank token. This token was a separate physical device that generated the unique password when the user needed to access their account."
What is the current common method for delivering OTPs for bank accounts?,The current common method for delivering One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for bank accounts involves sending them directly to the user's handphone. This leverages the widespread availability of mobile phones as a secure channel for transmitting time-sensitive authentication codes.
What are the three examples of authentication methods based on possession?,"Three examples of authentication methods based on possession, meaning something the user has, are: OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. Each of these requires the physical presence of the item to authenticate the user."
Describe the role of an OTP Card in user authentication.,"An OTP Card, or one-time password card, is a device used for user authentication. It generates a new password for the user each time they log in. This generated password is then used by the user to authenticate their identity to the system."
What is a Smart Card in the context of authentication?,"A Smart Card, in the context of authentication, is a type of card that contains an embedded microchip. This chip can store digital information and perform cryptographic operations. Smart Cards are used as a form of ""something you have"" authentication, providing a secure way to verify a user's identity."
How does an ATM Card function as a form of authentication?,"An ATM Card functions as a form of authentication based on possession. To use an ATM card, a user must physically possess the card. Combined with a PIN (Personal Identification Number), which is ""something you know,"" the ATM card enables secure access to financial accounts and transactions."
Explain the periodic password generation by SecurID cards.,"SecurID cards are designed to generate a new password for the user periodically. This means that the password displayed on the card changes at regular intervals, typically every 60 seconds. This dynamic nature of the password enhances security by ensuring that any intercepted password quickly becomes invalid."
What action does a user take when logging in with a SecurID card?,"When a user wants to log into a computer system using a SecurID card, they are prompted by the server to enter a password. The user then takes the number currently displayed on their SecurID card and enters it as the password. This number is a time-sensitive, one-time password generated by the card."
How does the server verify the password from a SecurID card?,"The server verifies the password from a SecurID card by utilizing the same algorithm that the card uses to generate passwords. The server knows this algorithm and can independently calculate the expected password for the current time interval. By comparing the user's entered password with its calculated expected password, the server can confirm the user's identity."
What are the implications if a user's password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hacker has a pre-computed match for that hash. This is a critical security breach, as it strongly suggests that the hacker can easily determine the user's original password. The phrase ""you are toast!"" highlights the severe risk and compromised security state this represents for the user."
Describe the process of a hacker cracking passwords using a dictionary attack.,"A hacker cracks passwords using a dictionary attack by employing a password cracking program. This program contains a large dictionary of common words, phrases, and potential password combinations. The hacker feeds the stolen password hashes into the program, which then attempts to match each hash against the pre-computed hashes of the dictionary entries. If a match is found, the original password is revealed."
What is the main advantage of using OTP systems over traditional passwords?,"The main advantage of using OTP systems over traditional passwords is the elimination of risks associated with password reuse. Each login uses a unique, time-sensitive password, meaning that even if a password is compromised, it is only valid for a very short period and cannot be used for future logins. This significantly enhances security compared to static passwords."
How can attackers exploit the 'listen in' vulnerability?,"Attackers can exploit the 'listen in' vulnerability by using techniques like network sniffing or installing keyloggers. Network sniffing captures data packets transmitted over a network, potentially revealing passwords during transmission. Keyloggers record keystrokes, capturing passwords as they are typed. Once captured, the attacker can use these credentials to log into the user's accounts."
What are the security benefits of passwords that are 'hard for password-cracking programs to guess'?,"Passwords that are 'hard for password-cracking programs to guess' offer significant security benefits because they are much less susceptible to brute-force and dictionary attacks. These passwords typically incorporate a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and avoid common patterns or words, making it computationally infeasible for cracking programs to find them within a reasonable timeframe."
Explain the concept of 'something you know' versus 'something you have' in authentication.,"'Something you know' refers to authentication factors that rely on information only the user should possess, such as a password or PIN. 'Something you have' refers to authentication factors that rely on the user possessing a physical item, like a security token, smart card, or mobile phone. OTP systems often combine these, using a password ('know') and an OTP generated by a device ('have')."
What is the purpose of a bank sending OTPs to a handphone?,"The purpose of a bank sending OTPs (One-Time Passwords) to a handphone is to provide a secure, second factor of authentication. The OTP is a unique, time-sensitive code that is sent to the user's mobile device. This code, combined with the user's password (something they know), helps verify that the person attempting to access the bank account is indeed the legitimate owner."
What are the different types of cards used for authentication based on possession?,"The different types of cards used for authentication based on possession (something the user has) include OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. Each of these physical items plays a role in verifying a user's identity through their possession."
How does the periodic nature of SecurID card passwords enhance security?,"The periodic nature of SecurID card passwords enhances security by ensuring that each password is only valid for a short duration (e.g., 60 seconds). This significantly reduces the window of opportunity for attackers. If a password is intercepted, it quickly becomes obsolete, preventing its reuse for subsequent unauthorized access attempts."
What is the role of a Personal Identification Number (PIN) in some OTP systems?,"In some OTP systems, the Personal Identification Number (PIN) serves as an initial security layer. The OTP is generated only after the user successfully enters their PIN. This means that possessing the OTP generating device is not enough; the user must also know their PIN to trigger the generation of the one-time password, adding an extra step of authentication."
How have OTP systems become more integrated into everyday devices?,"OTP systems have become more integrated into everyday devices by moving away from dedicated, separate hardware tokens. Now, OTP functionalities are often embedded within devices that users already carry and use regularly, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. This integration makes OTP authentication more convenient and less burdensome."
