What are the common methods hackers use to crack passwords?,"Hackers employ several methods to crack passwords. They do not typically try various combinations directly on applications. Instead, they often sniff and extract \""password hashes\"" from the internet when a user logs in. These password hashes are then stored in dictionaries. Hackers also utilize password cracking programs that use dictionaries of common passwords to crack them offline. If a user's password hash is found in these dictionaries, their account is compromised."
What is a password hash?,"A password hash is a transformed version of a password, generated using a common standard hash function. Hackers extract these hashes from the internet when users log in and store them in dictionaries to attempt cracking."
How do password cracking programs work?,"Password cracking programs attempt to hack into accounts by trying many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. These programs can often determine a significant percentage of usernames and passwords within a system. They are particularly effective when used with dictionaries of common passwords, allowing for offline cracking."
What is the success rate of password cracking programs?,"Password cracking programs can be quite effective, capable of determining 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system. This highlights the vulnerability of systems that rely solely on easily guessable passwords."
What is the primary requirement for an attacker to gain system access?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password. This emphasizes the importance of strong and unique credentials."
Under what conditions are passwords easy to crack?,Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are compelled to choose passwords that are difficult for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that complex and non-obvious passwords are more secure.
What is a disadvantage of traditional password security systems?,"A significant disadvantage of traditional password security systems is the need for users to reuse the same password each time they log into a system. This practice provides attackers with numerous opportunities to \""listen in\"" and capture the password."
What is a keylogger and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke made by a user on their computer. If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, an attacker can \""listen in\"" on their password as they type it, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts."
"What can an attacker do if they successfully \""listen in\"" on a password?","If an attacker successfully \""listens in\"" on a password, they can then log in as the user. This unauthorized access persists until the user next changes their password."
What is a one-time password (OTP) system?,"A one-time password (OTP) system is a security measure that forces the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the risk associated with using the same password multiple times, thereby enhancing security."
How does an OTP system improve password security?,"An OTP system improves password security by requiring a new password for each login session. This prevents attackers from exploiting previously captured passwords, as they become invalid after a single use."
What is the transition in authentication methods discussed?,"The discussion transitions from \""something you know\"" (passwords) to \""something you have.\"" This shift is naturally led by the concept of one-time passwords (OTP)."
Where were OTPs historically sent?,"Historically, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they attempted to access their bank account."
How are OTPs sent to users now?,"Currently, banks send OTPs to users' handphones. It is crucial for users not to lose their handphones, as they are essential for receiving these one-time passwords."
What are the general methods of authenticating a user based on possession?,"A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user possesses. This category includes OTP Cards (one-time password), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards."
What are OTP Cards?,OTP Cards are a type of authentication device that generates a new password each time a user logs in. These products are designed to enhance security by providing unique credentials for each session.
Can you give an example of an OTP Card product?,"One example of an OTP Card product is the SecurID card, developed by RSA Security. This card is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically."
How does the SecurID card work?,"The SecurID card is a device that flashes a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user wants to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
How does the server verify the password from a SecurID card?,The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to verify the password that the user enters from the card.
Are there variations of OTP systems besides physical cards?,"Yes, there are other variations of OTP systems. For instance, some OTP systems generate passwords for users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. Additionally, while OTP systems traditionally required separate devices, they are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
How can a PIN be used in some OTP systems?,"In some OTP systems, passwords are generated for users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This adds an extra layer of security, requiring both the PIN and the generated OTP."
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of devices?,"OTP systems have evolved from traditionally requiring users to carry separate devices. Now, these systems are sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, making them more convenient."
What is the purpose of sniffing and extracting password hashes?,"Sniffing and extracting password hashes is a method hackers use to obtain user credentials. They intercept these hashes from network traffic, typically when a user logs into a system, and then use them for cracking attempts."
What is the significance of a password hash appearing in a dictionary?,"If a password hash appears in a dictionary used by hackers, it means the password is weak or commonly used. In this scenario, the user is considered \""toast,\"" indicating a high risk of their account being compromised."
"Explain the concept of \""listening in\"" on a password.","\""Listening in\"" on a password refers to an attacker intercepting the password as it is transmitted or entered. This can be achieved through methods like keyloggers or network sniffing. Once the password is captured, the attacker can use it to gain unauthorized access."
"What is the difference between \""something you know\"" and \""something you have\"" in authentication?","\""Something you know\"" refers to authentication factors like passwords or PINs, which are pieces of information only the user should know. \""Something you have\"" refers to authentication factors that the user possesses, such as a physical token, a smart card, or a mobile phone that receives OTPs."
What are Smart Cards used for in authentication?,"Smart Cards are a method of authentication based on something the user possesses. They are used to verify a user's identity, often by storing cryptographic keys or other sensitive information."
What are ATM Cards used for in authentication?,"ATM Cards are a form of authentication based on possession. While primarily used for financial transactions, they also serve as a credential that the user has, often combined with a PIN (something they know) for verification."
How do hackers crack passwords offline?,Hackers crack passwords offline by using password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords. They take the extracted password hashes and run them through these programs to find matches without needing to interact with the target system directly.
What is the role of common standard hash functions in password cracking?,"Common standard hash functions are used by systems to create password hashes. Hackers exploit these standard functions because they are predictable and can be reversed or matched against known hash databases, facilitating password cracking."
What is the risk associated with reusing passwords?,"Reusing passwords across multiple systems is a significant security risk. If an attacker obtains a reused password from one compromised system, they can use it to access other accounts that use the same password, as it provides numerous opportunities for unauthorized access."
How can a user prevent their password from being easily cracked?,"To prevent passwords from being easily cracked, users should choose passwords that are difficult for password-cracking programs to guess. This involves creating complex passwords that are not common words or simple combinations, and ideally, using unique passwords for different accounts."
What is the function of a bank token in OTP systems?,"In older OTP systems, a bank token was a device used to generate or receive one-time passwords. When a user attempted to access their bank account, the OTP would be sent to this token for verification."
Why is it important not to lose your handphone in the context of OTPs?,"It is important not to lose your handphone because banks now send one-time passwords (OTPs) to users' mobile phones. Losing your handphone means losing access to these critical security codes, which could prevent you from accessing your bank account or other services."
What is the primary goal of password-cracking programs?,"The primary goal of password-cracking programs is to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by systematically trying to guess passwords. They achieve this by testing common passwords, dictionary words, and various combinations against stolen password hashes or by brute-forcing login attempts."
How do hackers obtain password hashes from the internet?,"Hackers obtain password hashes from the internet by \""sniffing\"" network traffic. When a user logs into a system, the password is often transmitted in a hashed format. Network sniffing tools can capture this data, allowing hackers to extract the hashes."
"What does it mean for a system to use a \""common standard hash function\"".","When a system uses a \""common standard hash function,\"" it means it employs a widely recognized and understood algorithm to convert passwords into hashes. While intended for security, these standard functions can be exploited by attackers who have knowledge of these algorithms and can use them to crack hashes more efficiently."
What is the implication of an attacker needing only one valid username and password?,"The implication is that even a single compromised credential can lead to a full system breach. This underscores the critical need for robust security measures for every user account, as any weak link can be exploited."
How does reusing passwords create numerous opportunities for attackers?,"Reusing passwords creates numerous opportunities for attackers because if an attacker compromises one account and obtains the password, they can then attempt to use that same password on many other accounts belonging to the same user. This significantly increases the chances of further unauthorized access."
"What is the purpose of a \""dictionary\"" in password cracking?","In password cracking, a \""dictionary\"" is a file containing a list of common words, phrases, and potential passwords. Password cracking programs use these dictionaries to systematically test likely password combinations against stolen hashes, making the cracking process more efficient than random guessing."
What is the difference between cracking passwords on an application versus offline?,"Cracking passwords on an application involves directly attempting to log in to the application with various password combinations. Cracking passwords offline involves using stolen password hashes and specialized software to attempt decryption without direct interaction with the target application or system, which is often faster and less detectable."
"What is the role of a \""password hash\"" in the context of cracking?","A \""password hash\"" is the target for hackers. They obtain these hashes and then use various techniques, such as dictionary attacks or brute-force methods, to find the original password that corresponds to the hash. The hash itself is not the password, but a representation of it."
"How does a keylogger enable an attacker to \""listen in\""?","A keylogger enables an attacker to \""listen in\"" by recording every keystroke the user makes on their keyboard. When the user types their password, the keylogger captures each character, effectively allowing the attacker to \""hear\"" or read the password as it is being entered."
What is the security benefit of a one-time password (OTP) system?,"The primary security benefit of an OTP system is that each password is used only once. This means that even if an attacker manages to intercept or steal an OTP, it will be invalid for subsequent login attempts, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability."
"How does the concept of \""something you have\"" enhance authentication?","Authentication based on \""something you have\"" enhances security by requiring a physical item that the user possesses. This is generally more secure than relying solely on \""something you know\"" (like passwords) because physical items are harder for remote attackers to obtain."
What is the function of RSA Security's SecurID card?,"RSA Security's SecurID card is a device that generates and displays a new, one-time password (OTP) to the user periodically. This OTP is then used by the user to authenticate their login to a computer system."
How can OTP systems be integrated into modern devices?,"OTP systems can be integrated into modern devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. Instead of requiring a separate physical token, the OTP functionality is built into these devices, making authentication more convenient."
What is the risk if a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the password is very likely weak or commonly used. This makes it trivial for the hacker to determine the original password, leading to the compromise of the user's account. The document states, \""If your password hash appear in the dictionary, you are toast!\"""
