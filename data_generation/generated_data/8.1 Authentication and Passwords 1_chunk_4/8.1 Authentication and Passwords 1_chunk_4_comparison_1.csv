What are the differences between password cracking programs and sniffing passwords?,"Password cracking programs and sniffing passwords are two distinct methods hackers use to obtain user credentials. Password cracking programs work by attempting to guess passwords, often using dictionaries of common words or brute-force combinations of characters. These programs can operate offline, meaning they don't require an active internet connection once the necessary data (like password hashes) is acquired. In contrast, sniffing passwords involves intercepting network traffic, typically over the internet, as a user logs into an application. This method captures the password or, more commonly, the ""password hash"" in real-time. While password cracking programs aim to break existing passwords, sniffing aims to capture them as they are transmitted."
Explain how hackers use password hashes to crack passwords.,"Hackers commonly ""sniff & extract the password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. A password hash is a one-way transformation of a password into a fixed-size string of characters. Systems typically use common standard hash functions to generate these hashes. Once a hacker obtains a password hash, they can then use password cracking programs. These programs often work by trying to guess the original password and then hashing it using the same algorithm. If the generated hash matches the stolen hash, the hacker has successfully cracked the password. This process can be done offline, as the hacker only needs the hash and the cracking program."
What is the primary method hackers use to obtain password hashes?,"Hackers commonly sniff and extract the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. This process involves intercepting the data transmitted during the login process. While systems use common standard hash functions to create these hashes, the act of sniffing captures them as they are sent, allowing hackers to then attempt to crack them offline."
Describe the process of cracking passwords using a dictionary attack.,"Cracking passwords using a dictionary attack involves writing or using a password cracking program that utilizes a dictionary of common passwords. The program systematically tries each word in the dictionary as a potential password. If the system being targeted uses common password hashes, and the original password is a common word found in the dictionary, the hacker can crack it. This type of attack is often performed offline once the password hashes have been obtained."
What is the significance of password hashes appearing in dictionaries for hackers?,"If a user's password hash appears in a dictionary that hackers use for cracking, it means their password is very likely to be compromised. This is because hackers maintain dictionaries of common passwords and their corresponding hashes. When they obtain a user's password hash, they can quickly check if it matches any in their dictionary. If a match is found, it implies the user's password is a common one that has already been cracked or is easily guessable, leaving the user vulnerable."
How do password-cracking programs attempt to gain access to accounts?,"Password-cracking programs attempt to gain access to accounts by trying many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. These programs are designed to automate the process of guessing credentials. They can efficiently test a large number of potential username and password combinations, often leading to the determination of a significant percentage of usernames and passwords within a system."
What is the typical success rate of password cracking programs in determining usernames and passwords?,"Password cracking programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords in a system. This is achieved by systematically trying common login names and combinations of common words as passwords, leveraging large dictionaries and brute-force techniques."
What is the minimum requirement for an attacker to gain access to a system?,"To gain access to a system, an attacker typically needs only one valid username and password. Once a single set of legitimate credentials is obtained, the attacker can then log into the system."
Under what conditions are passwords relatively easy to crack?,"Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are somehow forced to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that simple, common, or predictable passwords are much more susceptible to cracking attempts."
What is a disadvantage of users reusing passwords when logging into systems?,"A disadvantage of users reusing passwords each time they log into a system is that it gives an attacker numerous opportunities to ""listen in."" This means that if an attacker can intercept the password transmission even once, they can potentially gain access to the account repeatedly as long as the password remains unchanged."
What is the implication of a keylogger being installed on a user's PC?,"If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, it means that the attacker can record every keystroke the user makes. This includes sensitive information like usernames and passwords. Consequently, if the attacker can successfully ""listen in"" on a password transmission, they can then log in as the user until the password is next changed."
"What can an attacker do if they successfully ""listen in"" on a password?","If an attacker can successfully ""listen in"" on a password, they can then log in as the user. This access remains valid until the user next changes their password. This highlights the vulnerability of transmitting passwords over networks without adequate security measures."
How does a one-time password (OTP) system improve password security?,"A one-time password (OTP) system improves password security by forcing the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the risks associated with using a password multiple times, as each login attempt requires a unique, single-use password. This prevents attackers from exploiting previously captured passwords."
What is the fundamental shift in authentication methods that OTP systems represent?,"The basic idea behind OTP systems naturally leads from the topic of ""something you know"" (like a traditional password) to the topic of ""something you have."" This signifies a shift towards authentication methods that rely on possessing a physical token or device rather than just possessing knowledge."
How were OTPs historically sent to users for bank account access?,"In the past, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they tried to access their bank account. This token was a separate device that generated or displayed the one-time password."
How are OTPs currently sent to users for bank account access?,"Currently, banks send OTPs to a user's handphone (mobile phone). This means the user's mobile device is used to receive the one-time password for authentication purposes."
What is the critical advice given regarding handphones and OTPs?,"The critical advice given regarding handphones and OTPs is: ""Don't lose your handphone!"" This is because if a user loses their handphone, they may lose access to receiving OTPs, which are essential for authenticating into their bank accounts or other services."
What is the second general method of user authentication mentioned?,The second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user has. This category includes authentication factors that are physical items possessed by the user.
List examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have'.,"Examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have' include: OTP Cards (one-time password), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These are all physical items that a user must possess to authenticate themselves."
What are OTP Cards?,"OTP Cards, or one-time password cards, are a type of authentication method based on 'something you have.' These cards are designed to generate a new password each time a user logs in, enhancing security by ensuring that each password is used only once."
What is the SecurID card and how does it function?,"The SecurID card, a product by RSA Security, is a type of OTP card. It is a device that flashes a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds or so. When a user wants to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
How does the server verify the password entered from an OTP card like SecurID?,"The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to verify the password that the user enters from the card. By using the same algorithm, the server can independently generate the expected password for that time period and compare it to the user's input."
Describe a variation of OTP systems where a PIN is involved.,"In some variations of OTP systems, passwords are generated for users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This adds an extra layer of security, as the user must know their PIN in addition to having the OTP-generating device."
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of the devices used?,"While OTP systems traditionally required users to carry additional devices, they are sometimes now integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. This integration allows for more convenient authentication without the need for a separate, dedicated hardware token."
Compare password cracking programs and keyloggers in terms of how they obtain credentials.,"Password cracking programs and keyloggers are distinct methods hackers use to obtain credentials. Password cracking programs work by attempting to guess passwords, often using dictionaries or brute-force methods, and can operate offline after obtaining password hashes. Keyloggers, on the other hand, are installed on a user's PC to record every keystroke. This allows attackers to capture usernames and passwords as they are typed in real-time, enabling them to ""listen in"" on the login process."
What is the difference between 'something you know' and 'something you have' in authentication?,"'Something you know' refers to authentication factors that are based on knowledge, such as a password or a PIN. 'Something you have' refers to authentication factors that are based on possessing a physical item, such as an OTP card, a smart card, or an ATM card. OTP systems bridge this by often requiring both a password (something you know) and a device (something you have)."
How do hackers use dictionaries in the context of password cracking?,"Hackers use dictionaries in password cracking by employing programs that contain lists of common passwords. These programs attempt to match the stolen password hashes against hashes generated from the words in the dictionary. If a match is found, it means the user's password is one of the common words in the dictionary, and it can be easily cracked."
"What is the risk associated with reusing passwords, and how do OTP systems mitigate it?","The risk associated with reusing passwords is that each login provides an attacker with an opportunity to intercept the password or its hash. If an attacker successfully intercepts it once, they can potentially use it for future logins. OTP systems mitigate this risk by forcing users to enter a new, unique password for each login, thereby eliminating the possibility of an old password being reused or intercepted for subsequent access."
Explain the concept of 'listening in' on a password.,"The concept of 'listening in' on a password refers to the act of intercepting the transmission of a password over a network. This can be done by attackers who are monitoring network traffic. If they successfully 'listen in,' they capture the password or its hash as it is sent from the user to the server, potentially compromising the user's account."
What is the role of a password hash in the context of hacking?,"A password hash is a one-way transformed representation of a password. Hackers are interested in password hashes because they can be stolen and then subjected to offline cracking attempts using password cracking programs. By comparing generated hashes from potential passwords with the stolen hash, hackers can determine the original password."
How can a user's password be compromised if it appears in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the password is a common word or phrase that hackers commonly use in their cracking attempts. When a hacker obtains the password hash, they can quickly check if it corresponds to any of the hashes generated from their dictionary. A match indicates that the user's password is weak and easily compromised."
What are the implications of a system using common standard hash functions for passwords?,"When systems use common standard hash functions for passwords, it makes it easier for hackers to crack stolen password hashes. This is because the algorithms used for hashing are well-known, and hackers can use readily available tools and techniques to reverse the hashing process or generate matching hashes from common password lists."
How do password cracking programs differ from brute-force attacks?,"Password cracking programs often utilize dictionary attacks, which involve trying words from a predefined list of common passwords. Brute-force attacks, on the other hand, systematically try every possible combination of characters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found. While both aim to guess passwords, brute-force is more exhaustive and time-consuming."
What is the primary function of a SecurID card?,"The primary function of a SecurID card is to generate and display a new, unique password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. This generated password is then used by the user to log into a computer system, acting as a one-time password."
How does the server verify the password entered from a SecurID card?,The server verifies the password entered from a SecurID card by using the same algorithm that the card employs to generate passwords. The server knows this algorithm and can independently calculate the expected password for the current time period. It then compares this calculated password with the one entered by the user.
What is the relationship between OTP systems and the concept of 'something you have'?,"OTP systems are a prime example of authentication based on 'something you have.' They typically involve a physical device, such as an OTP card or a mobile phone, which generates or receives the one-time password. The user must possess this device to authenticate themselves, in addition to potentially knowing a PIN or password."
How can a user's handphone be used for authentication?,"A user's handphone can be used for authentication by receiving One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent by banks or other services. When a user attempts to access an account, an OTP is sent to their registered mobile number. The user then enters this OTP to verify their identity."
What are the security implications if a user loses their handphone when it's used for OTPs?,"If a user loses their handphone when it's used for OTPs, it poses a significant security risk. The lost device could fall into the wrong hands, allowing unauthorized individuals to receive OTPs and potentially gain access to the user's accounts, especially if they also have access to other credentials."
What are Smart Cards in the context of authentication?,Smart Cards are a type of authentication method based on 'something you have.' These cards typically contain a microchip that stores user information and can perform cryptographic functions. They are used to authenticate users by requiring the physical possession of the card.
What are ATM Cards in the context of authentication?,"ATM Cards are a form of authentication based on 'something you have.' To use an ATM card, a user must possess the physical card and typically enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN), which is 'something you know.' The card itself serves as the physical token for authentication."
How do password cracking programs differ from sniffing in terms of when they are used?,"Password cracking programs are typically used offline after a hacker has obtained password hashes. Sniffing, on the other hand, is an online activity where hackers intercept data, including password hashes, as it is transmitted over the internet during a login process. Sniffing captures the data in real-time, while cracking attempts to break it later."
What is the primary vulnerability that password reuse exploits?,"The primary vulnerability that password reuse exploits is the opportunity for attackers to 'listen in' on password transmissions. Each time a user logs in with a reused password, it presents a chance for an attacker to intercept the credentials. If successful, this interception can grant the attacker access for subsequent logins as well."
How does a keylogger compromise password security?,"A keylogger compromises password security by recording every keystroke a user makes on their computer. This means that when a user types their username and password, the keylogger captures these inputs. The attacker can then use this recorded information to gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts."
What is the advantage of OTP systems over traditional password systems regarding password reuse?,"The advantage of OTP systems over traditional password systems is that they eliminate the risks of password reuse. OTP systems force the user to enter a new password each time they log in, meaning that even if a password is intercepted, it is only valid for that single session and cannot be reused for future access."
Explain the concept of 'something you know' versus 'something you have' in authentication.,"'Something you know' refers to authentication methods that rely on information a user possesses mentally, such as a password or a PIN. 'Something you have' refers to authentication methods that require the user to possess a physical object, like an OTP card, a smart card, or a mobile phone. Multi-factor authentication often combines elements from both categories."
What is the purpose of a password hash in a computer system?,"The purpose of a password hash in a computer system is to store a one-way transformed representation of a user's password. Instead of storing the actual password, which would be a major security risk if the database were compromised, the system stores its hash. This hash can be used to verify the password during login without revealing the original password."
How can a hacker exploit a system that uses common standard hash functions?,"A hacker can exploit a system that uses common standard hash functions by obtaining the password hashes and then using password cracking programs. Since the hash functions are common and well-understood, hackers can efficiently generate hashes from lists of common passwords and compare them to the stolen hashes to find matches, thereby cracking the original passwords."
What is the difference between an online and offline password attack?,"An online password attack occurs when the attacker interacts directly with the target system in real-time, such as by attempting logins or sniffing network traffic. An offline password attack occurs when the attacker has obtained sensitive data, like password hashes, and attempts to crack them using their own resources without interacting with the target system."
How does the periodic generation of passwords by OTP products enhance security?,"The periodic generation of new passwords by OTP products, such as the SecurID card, enhances security by ensuring that each password is valid for a limited time only. This means that even if an attacker intercepts a password, it will quickly become obsolete and unusable for future login attempts, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability."
