What are the common methods hackers use to crack passwords?,"Hackers employ several methods to crack passwords. They do not typically try various combinations directly on applications. Instead, they often sniff and extract \""password hashes\"" from the internet when a user logs in. Systems commonly use standard hash functions for this. Hackers also utilize password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords, allowing them to crack passwords offline. Furthermore, they store these extracted password hashes in dictionaries, and if a user's password hash is found in such a dictionary, it is considered compromised."
What is a password hash?,"A password hash is a representation of a password that is generated using a hash function. When a user logs in, the system typically stores the hash of the password rather than the password itself. Hackers aim to obtain these password hashes to attempt to crack the original passwords."
How do password cracking programs work?,"Password cracking programs are tools used by attackers to determine valid usernames and passwords. These programs can try numerous common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. They are effective enough to determine a significant percentage, often 10 to 20 percent, of usernames and passwords within a system. To gain access to a system, an attacker typically only needs one valid username and password combination."
What is a disadvantage of traditional password security systems?,"A significant disadvantage of traditional password security systems is the need for users to reuse the same password each time they log into a system. This practice provides attackers with numerous opportunities to \""listen in\"" on the password entry process."
What is a keylogger?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on their computer. If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, an attacker can use it to capture the password when the user types it in. Once an attacker has successfully \""listened in\"" on a password, they can log in as that user until the password is changed."
What is a one-time password (OTP) system?,"A one-time password (OTP) system is a security measure that forces a user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the security risks associated with using the same password multiple times. OTP systems are a transition from \""something you know\"" (like a traditional password) to \""something you have.\"""
How are OTPs typically delivered?,"Historically, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they attempted to access their bank account. More recently, banks send OTPs to a user's handphone (mobile phone)."
What are examples of authentication methods based on 'something you have'?,"Authentication methods based on \""something you have\"" include OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These methods rely on a physical item that the user possesses to verify their identity."
How do OTP Cards work?,"OTP products, such as OTP Cards, generate a new password each time a user logs in. For example, the SecurID card, a product by RSA Security, is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user wants to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the card when prompted by the server."
How does the server verify the password from an OTP Card?,The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to verify the password that the user enters from the card.
What are some variations of OTP systems?,"Variations of OTP systems exist. Some OTP systems generate passwords for users only after a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. Additionally, while OTP systems traditionally required separate devices, they are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
What is the primary function of a password hash in the context of hacking?,"The primary function of a password hash in the context of hacking is that it is what hackers aim to obtain. Once they have the hash, they can use various techniques, such as dictionary attacks or brute-force methods, to try and determine the original password. If the hash appears in a pre-compiled dictionary of common hashes, the password can be cracked quickly."
Explain the concept of 'listening in' on a password.,"\""Listening in\"" on a password refers to an attacker's ability to intercept or capture the password as it is being entered by a user. This can be achieved through methods like keyloggers or network sniffing. Once an attacker has successfully \""listened in\"" on a password, they can use it to gain unauthorized access to the user's account."
What is the main benefit of a one-time password (OTP) system over traditional passwords?,"The main benefit of a one-time password (OTP) system over traditional passwords is that it eliminates the security risks associated with password reuse. Since a new password is generated for each login session, even if an attacker intercepts a password, it will be invalid for subsequent login attempts."
How does the SecurID card contribute to password security?,"The SecurID card enhances password security by generating a new, time-sensitive password that is displayed to the user periodically. This means that even if an attacker were to capture a password at one point, it would quickly become obsolete. The user then enters this dynamically generated password, which the server can verify using its knowledge of the generation algorithm."
What is the relationship between 'something you know' and 'something you have' in authentication?,"In authentication, \""something you know\"" typically refers to a password or PIN, which is information a user possesses mentally. \""Something you have\"" refers to a physical item, such as a token, card, or mobile phone, that the user possesses. OTP systems bridge this gap by combining elements of both, often requiring a password (something you know) to activate a device that generates a one-time password (something you have)."
What are the risks associated with reusing passwords?,"Reusing passwords across multiple systems significantly increases security risks. If one system's password database is compromised and the password hashes are extracted, attackers can use those hashes to attempt to log into other accounts where the same password might be used. This is because attackers can commonly sniff and extract password hashes, and then use password cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords to decipher them."
How can hackers obtain password hashes?,"Hackers can obtain password hashes primarily by sniffing network traffic as users log in. When a user enters their credentials, the system often sends a hashed version of the password over the network. Hackers can intercept this traffic to capture the hashes. They also store these hashes in dictionaries for later use."
What is the significance of a password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hash corresponds to a common or previously compromised password. In this scenario, the user's password can be easily cracked by the hacker, leaving their account vulnerable. The document states, \""If your password hash appear in the dictionary, you are toast!\"""
Describe the process of gaining system access using password cracking programs.,Password cracking programs are used by attackers to gain system access by trying numerous common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. These programs can efficiently determine a percentage of valid usernames and passwords within a system. The ultimate goal is to find at least one valid username and password combination that grants access to the system.
What is the role of a 'password hash' in the context of cracking?,"A 'password hash' is the target for many hacking techniques. Instead of directly guessing passwords on an application, hackers often intercept or extract these hashes. They then use specialized software to try and reverse the hashing process or match the hash against a database of known hashes. If a match is found, the original password is revealed."
How do hackers exploit the reuse of passwords?,Hackers exploit password reuse by obtaining a password hash from one compromised system. They then use this hash to attempt to log into other systems where the user might have used the same password. This is facilitated by password cracking programs that can quickly test a large number of common passwords against the stolen hash.
What is the purpose of 'sniffing' network traffic in password cracking?,"'Sniffing' network traffic is a method hackers use to capture data as it is transmitted. In the context of password cracking, they sniff traffic during the login process to intercept and extract the \""password hash\"" that is sent from the user's device to the server. This hash is then used for further cracking attempts."
What are the limitations of traditional password systems that hackers exploit?,"Hackers exploit the limitations of traditional password systems, primarily the tendency for users to reuse passwords and the fact that these passwords are often simple or common. The ability to \""listen in\"" on password entry and the storage of password hashes in dictionaries are also exploited weaknesses."
How does a keylogger facilitate unauthorized access?,"A keylogger facilitates unauthorized access by recording every keystroke a user makes. When a user types their password, the keylogger captures it. This captured password can then be used by an attacker to log into the user's account, effectively impersonating them until the password is changed."
What is the core principle behind a one-time password (OTP) system?,"The core principle behind a one-time password (OTP) system is to generate a unique password for each authentication session. This means that a password used once is immediately invalidated, preventing attackers from reusing intercepted credentials."
How does an OTP system transition from 'something you know' to 'something you have'?,"An OTP system transitions from 'something you know' to 'something you have' by requiring the user to possess a physical device (something you have) that generates a unique code. This code, often used in conjunction with a traditional password (something you know), provides a more robust authentication mechanism."
What are the different types of 'something you have' authentication methods mentioned?,"The document mentions several types of authentication methods based on 'something you have': OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These are physical items that a user must possess to authenticate themselves."
Explain the function of an OTP Card like the SecurID card.,"An OTP Card, such as the SecurID card, functions by generating a new password for the user each time they log in. This password is displayed on the card and changes periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds). The user then enters this displayed number when prompted by the system to authenticate."
How does the server validate the password generated by an OTP Card?,The server validates the password generated by an OTP Card because it possesses the same algorithm used by the card to create the passwords. This shared knowledge allows the server to predict and verify the correct password at any given time.
What are some modern integrations of OTP systems?,"Modern integrations of OTP systems include their incorporation into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. This contrasts with older systems that required users to carry separate, dedicated devices."
What is the primary goal of hackers when they crack passwords?,"The primary goal of hackers when they crack passwords is to gain unauthorized access to user accounts and the systems they protect. This access can be used for various malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, committing fraud, or disrupting services."
How do hackers use dictionaries in password cracking?,"Hackers use dictionaries in password cracking by storing lists of common passwords or, more specifically, lists of common password hashes. They then compare the captured password hashes against the entries in these dictionaries. If a match is found, it means the hash corresponds to a password in the dictionary, allowing the hacker to determine the original password."
What is the implication of a password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary?,"The implication of a password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary is that the user's password is very likely to be compromised. Dictionaries often contain hashes of commonly used or weak passwords. If a user's hash is found, it means their password is not secure and can be easily determined by the hacker."
How do password cracking programs differ from brute-force attacks?,"While not explicitly detailed as distinct, password cracking programs often utilize dictionary attacks, which are a form of brute-force attack. However, dictionary attacks are more targeted, using pre-defined lists of common words and phrases. Brute-force attacks, in a broader sense, involve systematically trying every possible combination of characters, which can be much slower than dictionary attacks if the password is not extremely simple."
What is the security risk of a user needing to reuse a password?,"The security risk of a user needing to reuse a password is that it creates multiple opportunities for an attacker to intercept or discover that password. If the password is compromised on one system, it can then be used to access all other systems where the same password is used, significantly increasing the attack surface."
How can an attacker leverage a keylogger to impersonate a user?,"An attacker can leverage a keylogger by installing it on a victim's computer. The keylogger then records all keystrokes, including the user's username and password. Once the attacker obtains this information, they can use it to log into the victim's accounts and impersonate them."
What is the advantage of an OTP system in preventing password reuse issues?,"The advantage of an OTP system in preventing password reuse issues is that each password generated is unique and valid only for a single session. This inherently eliminates the problem of users reusing the same password across multiple logins, as the password changes with each use."
How does the concept of 'something you have' enhance security?,"The concept of 'something you have' enhances security by introducing a physical element into the authentication process. Unlike passwords, which can be guessed or stolen through software, a physical token or card is generally harder for an attacker to obtain remotely, thus providing an additional layer of security."
What is the role of RSA Security in OTP systems?,"RSA Security is mentioned as a provider of an OTP product called the SecurID card. This card is a device that generates new passwords periodically for users, contributing to enhanced security through one-time password generation."
How does the SecurID card's periodic password generation benefit security?,"The SecurID card's periodic password generation benefits security by ensuring that any intercepted password quickly becomes obsolete. Since the password changes every 60 seconds or so, an attacker who manages to capture a password at a specific moment will not be able to use it for subsequent login attempts."
What is the function of a PIN in some OTP systems?,"In some OTP systems, a Personal Identification Number (PIN) serves as a prerequisite for generating a password. The OTP system may only generate a password for the user after they have entered their PIN, adding an extra layer of authentication."
What are the implications of losing your handphone in the context of OTPs?,"If you lose your handphone (mobile phone) and it is used to receive OTPs, it poses a significant security risk. Since OTPs are sent to your handphone for authentication, losing it could allow someone else to intercept these codes and gain access to your accounts, especially if they can also bypass other authentication factors."
How do hackers attempt to crack passwords without direct application interaction?,Hackers attempt to crack passwords without direct application interaction by focusing on obtaining password hashes. They commonly sniff and extract these hashes from network traffic during user logins. These hashes are then processed using password cracking programs and dictionaries of common passwords to determine the original credentials.
What is the primary method hackers use to obtain password hashes?,The primary method hackers use to obtain password hashes is by sniffing network traffic as users log in. This allows them to intercept the hashed representation of the password being transmitted from the user's device to the server.
What is the consequence if a password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary, it means the hash corresponds to a known or common password. This allows the hacker to easily determine the user's original password, rendering their account vulnerable. The document states this situation means 'you are toast!'"
How do password cracking programs leverage common passwords?,"Password cracking programs leverage common passwords by using dictionaries that contain lists of frequently used passwords, common words, and phrases. The program then systematically tries to match the captured password hashes against these entries. If a match is found, the original password is revealed."
What is the security benefit of a system that generates a new password each time a user logs in?,"The security benefit of a system that generates a new password each time a user logs in, such as an OTP system, is that it prevents the reuse of passwords. This means that even if a password is intercepted during one login, it will be invalid for any subsequent login attempts, significantly reducing the risk of account compromise."
