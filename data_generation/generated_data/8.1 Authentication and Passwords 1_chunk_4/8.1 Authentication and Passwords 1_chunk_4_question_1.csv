What are the common methods hackers use to crack passwords?,"Hackers employ several methods to crack passwords. They do not typically try various combinations directly on applications. Instead, they often ""sniff"" and extract password hashes from the internet as users log in. These password hashes are then stored in dictionaries. Hackers also utilize password cracking programs that employ dictionaries of common passwords to crack them offline. If a user's password hash is found in these dictionaries, their account is compromised."
Explain how hackers extract password hashes.,"Hackers commonly sniff and extract ""password hashes"" over the internet as users log in. A password hash is a one-way cryptographic function that converts a password into a fixed-size string of characters. This process is typically done by normal systems using common standard hash functions. By intercepting this hash, hackers can then attempt to crack it offline."
What is a password hash and how is it used by hackers?,"A password hash is the result of a one-way cryptographic function applied to a password. Systems use common standard hash functions to generate these hashes. Hackers commonly sniff and extract these password hashes from network traffic when users log in. They then store these hashes in dictionaries and use password cracking programs to try and determine the original password. If a user's password hash is found in a hacker's dictionary, it means their password can be easily compromised."
How do password cracking programs work?,"Password cracking programs work by attempting to guess passwords. Attackers use these programs to try many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. These programs can be very effective, potentially determining 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system. They often leverage dictionaries of common passwords and can perform these cracking attempts offline."
What is the effectiveness of password cracking programs?,Password cracking programs can be highly effective. They can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of the usernames and passwords within a system by trying common login names and concatenations of common words. The success rate is further amplified when these programs utilize dictionaries of common passwords for offline cracking.
What is the primary goal of an attacker trying to gain access to a system?,"The primary goal of an attacker trying to gain access to a system is to obtain one valid username and password. With this information, they can successfully log into the system."
Under what conditions are passwords relatively easy to crack?,"Passwords are relatively easy to crack when users are not forced to choose passwords that are hard for password-cracking programs to guess. This implies that simple, common, or predictable passwords are more vulnerable."
What is a disadvantage of traditional password security systems related to password reuse?,"A significant disadvantage of traditional password security systems is that users often need to reuse the same password each time they log into a system. This practice gives attackers numerous opportunities to ""listen in"" and capture the password."
"What does it mean for an attacker to ""listen in"" on a password?","For an attacker to ""listen in"" on a password means they are able to intercept or capture the password as it is being transmitted or entered. This can happen through various means, such as network sniffing or the use of malware like keyloggers. Once an attacker has successfully listened in on a password, they can use it to log into the user's account."
What is a keylogger and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on their computer. If a keylogger is installed on a user's PC, it can capture their password as they type it. This allows an attacker to ""listen in"" on the password and subsequently use it to gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts until the password is changed."
"What can an attacker do if they successfully ""listen in"" on a password?","If an attacker successfully ""listens in"" on a password, they can then log in as the user. This unauthorized access continues until the user next changes their password. This highlights the vulnerability of systems where passwords can be intercepted."
What is a one-time password (OTP) system?,"A one-time password (OTP) system is a security measure that forces the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the risks associated with using a password multiple times, as each password is only valid for a single session or transaction."
How does an OTP system improve password security?,"An OTP system improves password security by requiring a user to enter a new password for each login. This prevents attackers from exploiting previously captured passwords or using brute-force methods on static passwords. Each OTP is unique and typically has a short lifespan, significantly reducing the window of opportunity for attackers."
"What is the concept of ""something you know"" versus ""something you have"" in authentication?","In authentication, ""something you know"" refers to information that only the user should possess, such as a password or a PIN (Personal Identification Number). ""Something you have"" refers to a physical item that only the user should possess, such as a security token, a smart card, or a mobile phone. The transition from ""something you know"" to ""something you have"" often involves systems that use physical tokens or devices to generate or display authentication credentials."
How were OTPs historically sent for bank account access?,"In the past, OTPs were sent to a user's bank token when they tried to access their bank account. A bank token is a physical device that generates a unique, time-sensitive password."
How are OTPs sent to users now for bank account access?,"Currently, banks send OTPs to a user's handphone (mobile phone). This is a more convenient method compared to using separate bank tokens."
What is the importance of not losing your handphone in the context of OTPs?,"It is crucial not to lose your handphone because banks now send One-Time Passwords (OTPs) to it for accessing your bank account. If your phone is lost or stolen, an unauthorized person could potentially gain access to your bank account if they also have your other login credentials."
What are the general methods of authenticating a user based on possession?,"A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that the user possesses. This category includes: OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These methods rely on the user having a physical item to prove their identity."
"What are examples of authentication methods based on ""something you have""?","Examples of authentication methods based on ""something you have"" include OTP Cards (one-time password cards), Smart Cards, and ATM Cards. These are physical items that a user must possess to authenticate themselves."
What are OTP Cards?,"OTP Cards, or one-time password cards, are a type of authentication device. These products generate a new password each time a user logs in. This ensures that each password used is unique and has a limited validity period, enhancing security."
What is the SecurID card and how does it function?,"The SecurID card, a product by RSA Security, is a type of OTP (one-time password) device. It is a device that displays a new password to the user periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When a user needs to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server."
How does a user interact with a SecurID card for system login?,"When a user wants to log into a computer system using a SecurID card, the card displays a new password periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds). The user then enters this displayed number when prompted by the server to authenticate their identity."
How does the server verify the password from a SecurID card?,The server knows the algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. This allows the server to independently calculate the expected password at any given time and verify the password that the user enters from the card.
Are there variations of OTP systems besides the SecurID card?,"Yes, there are other variations of OTP systems. For instance, some OTP systems generate passwords for their users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. Additionally, while OTP systems traditionally required separate devices, they are now sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
Describe an alternative implementation of OTP systems.,One alternative implementation of OTP systems involves generating passwords for users only when a personal identification number (PIN) is entered. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring both a device and a PIN.
How have OTP systems evolved in terms of hardware requirements?,"OTP systems have evolved from traditionally requiring users to carry separate, dedicated devices. Now, these systems are sometimes integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, making them more convenient and accessible."
What is the primary function of a password hash in cybersecurity?,"The primary function of a password hash is to represent a password in a secure, one-way manner. Systems use common standard hash functions to convert passwords into hashes. This is done so that the original password is not stored in plain text, making it more difficult for attackers to steal if the system's database is compromised. However, hackers can still attempt to crack these hashes."
How do hackers use dictionaries in password cracking?,"Hackers use dictionaries in password cracking by storing lists of common passwords and their corresponding hashes. They obtain these hashes by sniffing them from network traffic or from compromised systems. Then, they use password cracking programs to compare the hashes they have obtained with the hashes in their dictionaries. If a match is found, they have successfully cracked the password."
What is the significance of a password hash appearing in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the password is very likely a common or easily guessable one. In this scenario, the user is considered ""toast,"" implying their account is highly vulnerable and likely to be compromised."
Explain the concept of offline password cracking.,"Offline password cracking refers to the process where an attacker attempts to crack passwords without needing to interact with the target system in real-time. This is typically done by obtaining password hashes from the system and then using powerful hardware and software, often with large dictionaries of common passwords, to try and reverse the hashing process. This method is faster and less detectable than online attempts."
What is the risk associated with reusing passwords across different systems?,"The risk associated with reusing passwords across different systems is that if one system is compromised and an attacker obtains the password hash, they can then use that same password to attempt access to other systems. This is because many users tend to use the same or similar passwords for multiple accounts."
How can attackers exploit common login names and words as passwords?,Attackers can exploit common login names and words as passwords by using password-cracking programs. These programs are designed to try numerous combinations of common login names and frequently used words as potential passwords. This method is effective because many users choose simple and predictable passwords.
What is the role of a bank token in OTP authentication?,"A bank token is a physical device used in OTP (one-time password) authentication. Historically, when a user attempted to access their bank account, the bank would send an OTP to this token. The token would then display a unique, time-sensitive password that the user would enter to complete the authentication process."
How does a smart card function as an authentication method?,"A smart card functions as an authentication method by being a physical item that the user possesses. It typically contains a microchip that can store sensitive information or perform cryptographic operations. When used for authentication, the smart card interacts with a reader or system to verify the user's identity, often in conjunction with a PIN or other credentials."
What is the purpose of an ATM card in the context of authentication?,"An ATM card serves as a form of authentication based on ""something you have."" When used at an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), the card itself is a physical token that identifies the user. It is typically used in conjunction with a Personal Identification Number (PIN), which is ""something you know,"" to authorize transactions and access bank accounts."
"What is the difference between ""something you know"" and ""something you have"" in authentication?","""Something you know"" refers to information that is secret and known only to the user, such as a password or PIN. ""Something you have"" refers to a physical object that the user possesses, such as a security token, a smart card, or a mobile phone. Both are used as factors in multi-factor authentication to verify a user's identity."
How does RSA Security's SecurID card generate new passwords?,"The SecurID card, a product by RSA Security, generates new passwords periodically. It is a device that flashes a new password to the user every 60 seconds or so. The server also knows the algorithm used by the SecurID card, allowing it to verify the password entered by the user."
What is the security implication of a user needing to reuse a password?,"The security implication of a user needing to reuse a password is that it significantly increases the risk of compromise. Each time the password is used, it presents an opportunity for an attacker to intercept or capture it. If the password is reused across multiple systems, a single compromise can lead to the unauthorized access of many accounts."
How can a password cracking program determine a large percentage of passwords in a system?,"A password cracking program can determine a large percentage of passwords in a system by systematically trying common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords. These programs are often equipped with extensive dictionaries of frequently used passwords, allowing them to efficiently test a vast number of possibilities, especially in offline cracking scenarios."
What is the role of a common standard hash function in password security?,"A common standard hash function is used by systems to convert user passwords into password hashes. These functions are designed to be one-way, meaning it's computationally difficult to derive the original password from the hash. This is a fundamental security measure to prevent storing passwords in plain text, although the hashes themselves can still be targeted by attackers."
"Explain the concept of ""password hash"" in the context of hacking.","A ""password hash"" is a one-way transformation of a user's password using a cryptographic hash function. Hackers are interested in these hashes because they can be extracted from systems, often during the login process via network sniffing. While the hash is not the password itself, hackers use specialized software and dictionaries to try and reverse the hashing process to find the original password."
What is the primary vulnerability that password cracking programs exploit?,"The primary vulnerability that password cracking programs exploit is the use of weak, predictable, or common passwords by users. By trying common login names and concatenations of common words, and by using dictionaries of known passwords, these programs can efficiently guess and crack a significant portion of user credentials."
How does the integration of OTP systems into PDAs and cell phones change authentication?,"The integration of OTP systems into PDAs and cell phones makes authentication more convenient. Instead of carrying a separate hardware token, users can receive or generate OTPs directly on their mobile devices. This streamlines the process of multi-factor authentication while leveraging existing user hardware."
What is the risk if an attacker gains access to a user's handphone that receives OTPs?,"If an attacker gains access to a user's handphone that receives OTPs, they could potentially intercept these one-time passwords. If they also possess the user's username and password (something they know), they could then use the intercepted OTP to gain unauthorized access to the user's bank account or other sensitive services."
What is the purpose of a PIN in some OTP systems?,"In some OTP systems, a Personal Identification Number (PIN) is used as an additional security layer. The OTP is generated only when the user enters their correct PIN. This means that even if an attacker obtains the OTP device, they still need to know the user's PIN to generate a valid password."
How does a user typically log in using an OTP card?,"When using an OTP card for login, the card itself generates a new, time-sensitive password. The user then enters this password, along with their username, into the system's login prompt. The system verifies this OTP against its own generated sequence or algorithm."
What is the main advantage of using OTP systems over traditional passwords?,"The main advantage of using OTP systems over traditional passwords is enhanced security. OTPs are dynamic and change frequently (e.g., every 60 seconds or for each login), making them much harder for attackers to intercept and reuse compared to static passwords. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access."
