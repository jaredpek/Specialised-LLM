Compare how hackers crack passwords using dictionary attacks versus sniffing.,"Hackers crack passwords using dictionary attacks by writing or using a password cracking program with a dictionary of common passwords. This process is performed offline. In contrast, sniffing involves commonly extracting the ""password hash"" over the internet as a user logs in. This hash is then used for cracking."
What is a password hash and how is it used by hackers?,"A password hash is a representation of a password that is commonly extracted by hackers over the internet as a user logs in. Systems typically use common standard hash functions. Hackers can then store these password hashes in dictionaries. If a user's password hash appears in such a dictionary, it is considered compromised."
"Explain the concept of ""listening in"" on a password.","The concept of ""listening in"" on a password refers to an attacker gaining opportunities to observe a password as a user logs into a system. This can happen if a user reuses the same password for multiple logins. If an attacker successfully ""listens in"" on a password, they can then log in as that user until the password is changed."
What is a keylogger and how does it relate to password security?,"A keylogger is a type of malicious software that can be installed on a user's personal computer (PC). Its function is to record every keystroke made by the user. This information can include sensitive data like passwords, which can then be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to accounts."
Describe the limitations of traditional password security systems.,"A significant disadvantage of traditional password security systems is the need for users to reuse passwords for multiple logins. This practice provides attackers with numerous opportunities to intercept or ""listen in"" on passwords. Additionally, attackers can use password-cracking programs with dictionaries of common words to guess passwords, potentially compromising a significant percentage of usernames and passwords in a system."
What are password-cracking programs and how do they work?,"Password-cracking programs are tools used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts. These programs attempt to guess passwords by trying numerous common login names and concatenations of common words. They can be very effective, potentially determining 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system. This process can be performed offline."
What is an OTP system and how does it enhance password security?,"An OTP system, which stands for One-Time Password, forces the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This eliminates the security risks associated with using the same password multiple times. OTPs are typically sent to a user's handphone or bank token when they attempt to access their bank account."
"What is the difference between ""something you know"" and ""something you have"" in authentication?","In authentication, ""something you know"" refers to information that only the user is supposed to know, such as a password or a Personal Identification Number (PIN). ""Something you have"" refers to a physical item that only the user possesses, such as an OTP card, a smart card, or an ATM card. These are used as methods to verify a user's identity."
Explain the function of OTP Cards in authentication.,"OTP Cards, or One-Time Password Cards, are a method of authentication based on something the user possesses. These products generate a new password each time a user logs in. For example, the SecurID card is a device that displays a new password periodically, typically every 60 seconds. When logging into a system, the user enters the number shown on the card when prompted by the server."
How does a SecurID card work for authentication?,"A SecurID card is a device that generates a new password for the user periodically, usually every 60 seconds. When a user needs to log into a computer system, they enter the number displayed on the SecurID card when prompted by the server. The server knows the algorithm used by the SecurID card to generate passwords and can verify the password entered by the user."
What are some variations of OTP systems?,"Besides dedicated OTP cards like the SecurID, other variations of OTP systems exist. Some OTP systems generate passwords for users only after a Personal Identification Number (PIN) is entered. Traditionally, these systems required users to carry separate devices, but they are now often integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones."
How can attackers compromise passwords through sniffing?,"Attackers can compromise passwords through sniffing by intercepting network traffic. When a user logs into a system, their login credentials, including the password hash, can be transmitted over the internet. Sniffing tools can capture this data, allowing attackers to extract the password hash for later use."
What is the risk if a password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means the password is compromised. Hackers maintain dictionaries of common password hashes. The presence of a user's hash in such a dictionary indicates that their password is weak, commonly used, or has been previously cracked, making their account vulnerable."
How do password-cracking programs differ from brute-force attacks?,"The provided document describes password-cracking programs that use a dictionary of common passwords. While not explicitly defined as distinct from brute-force, this method implies a more targeted approach using known common words rather than trying every possible combination of characters, which is the hallmark of a pure brute-force attack."
What is the significance of a user needing only one valid username and password to gain system access?,"The significance of an attacker needing only one valid username and password to gain access to a system is that it highlights the critical importance of securing each individual account. Even if a system has many users, compromising just one account with a valid username and password can provide an attacker with a foothold to potentially access other parts of the system or network."
How does reusing passwords create opportunities for attackers?,"Reusing passwords creates opportunities for attackers because it allows them to ""listen in"" on a password. If a user logs into multiple systems with the same password, an attacker who compromises one system or intercepts the password during a login on another system can then use that same password to access all other systems where the user has reused it."
What is the role of a bank token in OTP systems?,"In the past, a bank token was used to receive an OTP (One-Time Password) when a user attempted to access their bank account. This token would generate or display a unique, time-sensitive password that the user would then enter to authenticate their identity."
How have OTP systems evolved regarding the devices used?,OTP systems have evolved from traditionally requiring users to carry separate devices to now being integrated into personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. This integration makes it more convenient for users to access OTPs without needing an additional physical token.
What are Smart Cards and ATM Cards in the context of authentication?,"Smart Cards and ATM Cards are examples of authentication methods based on ""something you have."" They are physical items that a user possesses and are used to verify their identity when accessing systems or performing transactions. The specific mechanisms by which they authenticate users are not detailed in the provided text, beyond being a form of possession-based authentication."
What is the primary function of a password-cracking program?,"The primary function of a password-cracking program is to attempt to discover user passwords. Attackers use these programs to try many common login names and concatenations of common words as passwords, aiming to gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems."
"What makes passwords ""hard for password-cracking programs to guess""?","Passwords are hard for password-cracking programs to guess when users are forced to choose passwords that are complex and not easily predictable. This typically involves using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding common words or easily guessable patterns. The document implies that users are sometimes forced to choose such strong passwords."
How does an attacker benefit from a user reusing a password?,"An attacker benefits from a user reusing a password by gaining access to multiple accounts with a single compromised password. If an attacker obtains a password from one system, they can then use that same password to attempt to log into other systems where the user has reused it, significantly increasing their potential for unauthorized access."
What is the consequence if a user loses their handphone in the context of OTPs?,"If a user loses their handphone, and that handphone is used to receive One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for banking or other secure access, they will be unable to receive these critical authentication codes. This would prevent them from logging into their accounts or authorizing transactions, effectively locking them out until they can regain access to a device that can receive OTPs."
Compare the methods hackers use to crack passwords.,"Hackers employ several methods to crack passwords. One method involves using password-cracking programs with dictionaries of common passwords, which can be done offline. Another method is to ""sniff"" and extract password hashes from the internet as users log in. They also store these password hashes in dictionaries, and if a user's hash is found, their password is compromised."
What is the purpose of a password hash in system security?,"The purpose of a password hash in system security is to store a representation of a password that can be verified without storing the actual password. Systems typically use common standard hash functions to create these hashes. When a user logs in, the system hashes the entered password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated."
"What does it mean for a user to be ""toast"" if their password hash appears in a dictionary?","If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it means their password is highly vulnerable and likely compromised. Hackers maintain lists of common password hashes. The presence of a user's hash in such a list indicates that their password is weak, has been exposed, or can be easily cracked, rendering their account insecure."
How can password-cracking programs determine a percentage of usernames and passwords in a system?,"Password-cracking programs can determine a percentage of usernames and passwords in a system by systematically attempting to crack them. By using dictionaries of common passwords and potentially other cracking techniques, these programs can successfully guess a portion of the valid credentials. The document states that such programs can easily determine 10 to 20 percent of usernames and passwords in a system."
"What is the fundamental idea behind ""something you have"" authentication?","The fundamental idea behind ""something you have"" authentication is that a user's identity is verified based on a physical item that they possess. This method relies on the principle that only the legitimate user will have access to this specific item, which could be an OTP card, a smart card, or an ATM card, among others."
What is the role of the server in verifying passwords generated by SecurID cards?,"The server plays a crucial role in verifying passwords generated by SecurID cards. The server possesses the same algorithm that the SecurID card uses to generate passwords. When a user enters the password displayed on their SecurID card, the server uses its algorithm to check if the entered password matches the expected password for that time, thereby verifying the user's identity."
How can OTP systems be integrated into modern devices?,"OTP systems can be integrated into modern devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones. Instead of requiring a separate physical token, the functionality to generate or receive One-Time Passwords is built directly into these devices. This allows for more convenient and streamlined authentication processes."
What is the main advantage of a one-time password (OTP) system?,"The main advantage of a one-time password (OTP) system is that it forces the user to enter a new password each time they log in. This significantly enhances security by eliminating the risks associated with using a password multiple times, as each login uses a unique, time-sensitive code."
What are the two main categories of authentication methods mentioned?,"The two main categories of authentication methods mentioned are ""something you know"" and ""something you have."" ""Something you know"" refers to information like passwords or PINs, while ""something you have"" refers to physical items like OTP cards, smart cards, or ATM cards."
How do hackers attempt to crack passwords offline?,"Hackers attempt to crack passwords offline by using password-cracking programs that leverage dictionaries of common passwords. They can also use stored password hashes in dictionaries. By having the password hash or a list of common passwords, they can run these programs on their own systems without needing to be connected to the target system or network."
What is the function of a password hash in the context of hacking?,"In the context of hacking, a password hash is a piece of data that attackers commonly sniff and extract from the internet as users log in. They store these hashes in dictionaries. If a user's password hash is found in one of these dictionaries, it indicates that the password is compromised and can be easily cracked."
What is the implication of a hacker using a dictionary of common passwords?,"The implication of a hacker using a dictionary of common passwords is that they are employing a targeted approach to cracking. Instead of trying every possible character combination (brute-force), they focus on words, phrases, and patterns that are frequently used as passwords. This significantly increases the speed and efficiency of their cracking attempts."
"How does an attacker gain an advantage by ""listening in"" on a password?","An attacker gains an advantage by ""listening in"" on a password because it allows them to obtain the password without needing to crack it through complex methods. If they successfully intercept a password during a login, they can then use that password to access the user's account, often until the user next changes their password."
What is the purpose of a PIN in some OTP systems?,"In some OTP systems, a Personal Identification Number (PIN) is used as a prerequisite for generating a password. The OTP system will only generate a password for the user after the user has entered their PIN. This adds an extra layer of security, as both the PIN (something you know) and the OTP generation mechanism (often tied to a device you have) are required."
What is the difference between a traditional OTP system and modern integrated OTP systems?,"The difference lies in the hardware required. Traditional OTP systems often necessitated users carrying separate, dedicated devices to generate or receive one-time passwords. Modern integrated OTP systems, however, embed this functionality directly into devices that users already carry, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, making the process more convenient."
How does a SecurID card help prevent password reuse issues?,"A SecurID card helps prevent password reuse issues because it generates a new password for the user each time they log in. This means that even if an attacker were to somehow obtain a password from a previous login, it would be invalid for subsequent login attempts, as a new, unique password would be displayed on the card."
What is the primary risk associated with reusing passwords?,"The primary risk associated with reusing passwords is that it provides attackers with numerous opportunities to ""listen in"" on a password. If a password is used across multiple systems, compromising it on one system allows an attacker to potentially gain access to all other systems where that same password is used."
What is the role of a bank token in the context of accessing bank accounts?,"In the past, a bank token was a device used to receive a One-Time Password (OTP) when a user attempted to access their bank account. This token would generate a unique, time-sensitive password that the user would then input to authenticate their access to the bank account."
"How can attackers exploit the ""something you know"" authentication method?","Attackers can exploit the ""something you know"" authentication method by using password-cracking programs. These programs attempt to guess passwords by trying common login names and concatenations of common words. They can also use dictionaries of common passwords and stored password hashes to crack passwords, especially if the passwords are weak or easily guessable."
What is the purpose of a password hash in the context of system security?,"In system security, a password hash is a one-way transformation of a password. Systems typically use common standard hash functions to create these hashes. When a user logs in, the system hashes the entered password and compares it to the stored hash. This verification process allows the system to confirm the user's identity without storing the actual, potentially vulnerable, password."
What is the main difference between how hackers crack passwords using dictionaries versus sniffing?,"When cracking passwords using dictionaries, hackers utilize password-cracking programs with lists of common passwords, performing this offline. In contrast, sniffing involves intercepting and extracting ""password hashes"" from network traffic as users log in over the internet. The extracted hash is then used for cracking."
"What does it mean for a system to use a ""common standard hash function""?","It means that the system employs a widely recognized and established algorithm for converting passwords into password hashes. These functions are designed to be one-way, meaning it's computationally difficult to reverse the process and obtain the original password from the hash. Examples include functions like MD5 or SHA-256, though the document does not specify which ones are used."
How can a user's password hash appearing in a dictionary lead to account compromise?,"If a user's password hash appears in a hacker's dictionary, it signifies that the password is very likely compromised. Hackers compile these dictionaries with hashes of commonly used or previously cracked passwords. The presence of a user's hash means their password is either weak, exposed, or can be easily reverse-engineered, granting attackers access to their account."
What is the advantage of password-cracking programs that use dictionaries?,"The advantage of password-cracking programs that use dictionaries is their efficiency. Instead of trying every possible combination of characters (brute-force), they focus on a curated list of common words, phrases, and patterns that are frequently used as passwords. This significantly speeds up the process of finding a valid password."
How does an attacker leverage the fact that only one valid username and password are needed for system access?,"An attacker leverages this by focusing their efforts on compromising a single, valid username and password. Once they obtain this credential pair, they can gain access to the system. This highlights the critical need for strong individual account security, as compromising even one account can provide an entry point."
What is the security implication of a user needing to reuse a password each time they log into a system?,"The security implication is that it gives an attacker numerous opportunities to ""listen in"" on the password. Each time the user logs in with the same password, there is a chance for an attacker to intercept it, either through network sniffing or by compromising the system where the password is being entered. This repeated exposure significantly increases the risk of compromise."
