"Define the concept of a ""Subject"" in access control.",A subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated.
What are the three types of subjects in access control?,"There can be three types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other."
"Define ""Owner"" as a type of subject.","An Owner is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator."
"Explain the ""Group"" type of subject and its purpose.","A Group is a type of subject where, in addition to individual users, privileges can also be assigned to a group of users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update the permissions."
"Define ""Other"" in the context of subjects.",Other refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. They are granted the least amount of access.
How are privileges managed for users joining or quitting a group?,"When a user joins a group, they will automatically have the corresponding privileges. Conversely, when a user quits the group, they will lose the corresponding permissions."
"Define the term ""Object"" in the context of access control.",An object is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs."
List the various components of computer systems that are considered objects.,"The various components of computer systems that are considered objects include Apps, Network sockets, Memory, Databases, Hard disks, and Printers."
"What is an ""Operation"" in access control?",An operation describes the way in which a subject may access an object.
"Describe the ""Read"" operation and what it includes.","The Read operation allows a user to view information in a system resource, such as a file, selected records in a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination. Read access includes the ability to copy or print."
"Define the ""Write"" operation.","The Write operation allows a user to modify data in a system resource, such as files, records, or programs."
"What does the ""Execute"" operation allow a user to do?",The Execute operation allows a user to execute specified programs.
"Define the ""Delete"" operation.","The Delete operation allows a user to delete certain system resources, such as files or records."
"What is the purpose of the ""Create"" operation?","The Create operation allows a user to create new files, records, or fields."
"Describe the ""Search"" operation.",The Search operation allows a user to list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory.
List all the types of operations a subject may perform on an object.,"The types of operations a subject may perform on an object include Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Create, and Search."
"Define an ""Access Control Matrix"".",An Access Control Matrix is a popular implementation of an access control policy.

"Based on the Access Control Matrix, what access rights does User B have for File 2 and File 4?","Based on the Access Control Matrix, User B has Read, Write, and Execute access rights for File 2, and Read access rights for File 4."
"What are User C's access rights for File 1 and File 4, according to the Access Control Matrix?","According to the Access Control Matrix, User C has Read and Write access rights for File 1, and Read, Write, and Execute access rights for File 4."
List the possible changes that can be made to an Access Control Matrix.,"Possible changes over an Access Control Matrix include: Create subject s, Create object o, Grant permission r for subject s over object o, Revoke permission r for subject s over object o, Destroy subject s, and Destroy object o."
How is a new subject 's' created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new subject 's', a new row 's' is added to the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
Explain the process of creating a new object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix.,The process of creating a new object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix involves creating a new column 'o'. This action is typically done by the system administrator.
How is a permission 'r' granted for a subject 's' over an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix?,"To grant permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o', the permission 'r' is entered into the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This is typically done by the resource owner or system administrator."
Describe how to revoke a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix.,"To revoke a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o', the permission 'r' is deleted from the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This is typically done by the resource owner or system administrator."
What happens when a subject 's' is destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"When a subject 's' is destroyed in an Access Control Matrix, the corresponding row 's' is deleted. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
Explain the action of destroying an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix.,Destroying an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix involves deleting the corresponding column 'o'. This action is typically done by the system administrator.
"Who typically performs updates to an Access Control Matrix, such as creating or destroying subjects and objects, or granting/revoking permissions?","Updates to an Access Control Matrix, such as creating or destroying subjects and objects, or granting/revoking permissions, are typically done by the system administrator or the resource owner."
How is an Access Control List (ACL) related to an Access Control Matrix?,"In practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse and can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways, one of which is the Access Control List (ACL), which is a decomposition by columns."
"Describe the ""Decomposition by columns"" method for implementing an access control matrix, also known as an Access Control List (ACL).","The ""Decomposition by columns"" method, used for implementing an access control matrix, is known as an Access Control List (ACL). For each object, an ACL lists the users and their permitted access rights."
What is the convenience of using an Access Control List (ACL)?,An Access Control List (ACL) is convenient when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource.
"Based on the Access Control List diagram, what are the access rights for File 1?","Based on the Access Control List diagram, File 1 has Read, Write, and Execute access for User A, Read access for User B, and Read, Write access for User C."
"Based on the Access Control List diagram, what are the access rights for File 2?","Based on the Access Control List diagram, File 2 has Read, Write, and Execute access for User B, and Read access for User C."

How is a Capability List (C-List) related to an Access Control Matrix?,"In practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse and can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways, one of which is the Capability List (C-List), which is a decomposition by rows."
"Describe the ""Decomposition by rows"" method for implementing an access control matrix, also known as a Capability List (C-List).","The ""Decomposition by rows"" method, used for implementing an access control matrix, is known as a Capability List (C-List). A C-list specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user."
What is the convenience of using a Capability List (C-List)?,A Capability List (C-List) is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user.
"Based on the Capability List diagram, what are the access rights for User A?","Based on the Capability List diagram, User A has Read, Write, and Execute access for File 1, and Read, Write, and Execute access for File 3."
"Based on the Capability List diagram, what are the access rights for User B?","Based on the Capability List diagram, User B has Read access for File 1, Read, Write, and Execute access for File 2, Write access for File 3, and Read access for File 4."
