Define the concept of a 'Subject' in the context of access control.,"A **subject** is an entity that is typically held accountable for the actions it has initiated. In access control systems, subjects are the active entities that request access to resources."
"What are the three types of subjects, and how are they defined?","There are three types of subjects: \n\n1.  **Owner**: This refers to the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. \n2.  **Group**: In addition to individual users, privileges can also be assigned to a group of users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions. \n3.  **Other**: This category is granted the least amount of access and includes users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource."
Explain the role of a 'Group' as a type of subject in managing privileges.,"A **Group** is a type of subject where privileges are assigned to a collection of users rather than individual users. When a user joins a group, they automatically inherit the corresponding privileges associated with that group. Conversely, if a user quits a group, they will lose those permissions. The primary purpose of using groups is to simplify the management and updating of permissions across multiple users."
Define the term 'Object' in the context of access control.,An **object** is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Objects are the passive entities that subjects attempt to access or modify.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of **objects** in a computer system include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs. Other examples illustrated include applications (Apps), memory, databases, printers, hard disks, and network sockets."
What is an 'Operation' in the context of access control?,An **operation** describes the way in which a subject may access an object. These are the specific actions or types of interactions that a user (subject) can perform on a resource (object).
List and describe the different types of operations a subject can perform on an object.,"The different types of operations a subject can perform on an object are: \n\n1.  **Read**: A user may view information in a system resource, such as a file, selected records in a file, or selected fields within a record. Read access also includes the ability to copy or print. \n2.  **Write**: A user may modify data in the system resource, which includes files, records, or programs. \n3.  **Execute**: A user may execute specified programs. \n4.  **Delete**: A user may delete certain system resources, such as files or records. \n5.  **Create**: A user may create new files, records, or fields. \n6.  **Search**: A user may list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory."
What does 'Read access' entail?,"**Read access** allows a user to view information contained within a system resource. This can apply to an entire file, specific records within a file, or even selected fields within a record. Importantly, read access also includes the ability to copy or print the information."
Define an 'Access Control Matrix'.,An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy. It is a conceptual model used to represent the permissions that subjects have over objects within a system.
Describe the structure of an Access Control Matrix.,The structure of an **Access Control Matrix** consists of two main dimensions: \n\n1.  One dimension consists of identified **subjects** that may attempt to access resources. These are typically represented as rows in the matrix. \n2.  The other dimension lists the **objects** that may be accessed. These are typically represented as columns in the matrix. \n\nEach entry within the matrix indicates the specific access rights (or permissions) that a particular subject has for a particular object.
"Based on the provided Access Control Matrix, what are User A's access rights for File 1 and File 3?","Based on the Access Control Matrix: \n\n*   For **File 1**, User A has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access rights. \n*   For **File 3**, User A also has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access rights."
"Based on the provided Access Control Matrix, what are User B's access rights for File 2 and File 4?","Based on the Access Control Matrix: \n\n*   For **File 2**, User B has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access rights. \n*   For **File 4**, User B has **Read** access rights."
"Based on the provided Access Control Matrix, what are User C's access rights for File 1 and File 4?","Based on the Access Control Matrix: \n\n*   For **File 1**, User C has **Read** and **Write** access rights. \n*   For **File 4**, User C has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access rights."
Who typically performs updates to an Access Control Matrix?,"Updates to an **Access Control Matrix** are typically done by the system administrator. In some cases, granting or revoking permissions can also be done by the resource owner."
How is a new subject 's' created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new subject 's' in an **Access Control Matrix**, a new row 's' is added to the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
How is a new object 'o' created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new object 'o' in an **Access Control Matrix**, a new column 'o' is added to the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
Explain the process of granting permission 'r' for subject 's' over object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix.,"Granting permission 'r' for subject 's' over object 'o' involves entering the permission 'r' into the entry M_s,o (the cell at the intersection of subject 's' and object 'o') in the **Access Control Matrix**. This action is typically performed by the resource owner or the system administrator."
How is a permission 'r' revoked for subject 's' over object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix?,"To revoke permission 'r' for subject 's' over object 'o' in an **Access Control Matrix**, the permission 'r' is deleted from the entry M_s,o (the cell at the intersection of subject 's' and object 'o'). This action is typically performed by the resource owner or the system administrator."
How is a subject 's' destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"To destroy a subject 's' in an **Access Control Matrix**, the entire row corresponding to subject 's' is deleted from the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
How is an object 'o' destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"To destroy an object 'o' in an **Access Control Matrix**, the entire column corresponding to object 'o' is deleted from the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
"What is an Access Control List (ACL), and how does it relate to an Access Control Matrix?","An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a method of implementing an access control matrix, particularly when the matrix is sparse (meaning most subjects do not have access to most objects). It represents a decomposition of the access control matrix by columns."
"Describe the concept of ""Decomposition by columns"" in the context of Access Control Lists (ACLs).","**Decomposition by columns** is a method of implementing an access control matrix, where for each object, an **Access Control List (ACL)** is created. This ACL lists all the users (subjects) and their permitted access rights for that specific object. This approach is convenient when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource."
"Based on the provided ACL example, what are the access rights for File 1?","Based on the ACL example for **File 1**, the access rights are: \n\n*   User A: Read, Write, Execute \n*   User B: Read \n*   User C: Read, Write"
"Based on the provided ACL example, what are the access rights for File 2?","Based on the ACL example for **File 2**, the access rights are: \n\n*   User B: Read, Write, Execute \n*   User C: Read"
"Based on the provided ACL example, what are the access rights for File 3?","Based on the ACL example for **File 3**, the access rights are: \n\n*   User A: Read, Write, Execute \n*   User B: Write"
"Based on the provided ACL example, what are the access rights for File 4?","Based on the ACL example for **File 4**, the access rights are: \n\n*   User B: Read \n*   User C: Read, Write, Execute"
"What is a Capability List (C-List), and how does it relate to an Access Control Matrix?","A **Capability List (C-List)** is another method of implementing an access control matrix, especially when the matrix is sparse. It represents a decomposition of the access control matrix by rows."
"Describe the concept of ""Decomposition by rows"" in the context of Capability Lists (C-Lists).","**Decomposition by rows** is a method of implementing an access control matrix, where for each subject, a **Capability List (C-List)** is created. This C-List specifies the authorized objects and the operations that a particular user (subject) can perform on them. This approach is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user."
"Based on the provided C-List example, what are the access rights for User A?","Based on the C-List example for **User A**, the access rights are: \n\n*   File 1: Read, Write, Execute \n*   File 3: Read, Write, Execute"
"Based on the provided C-List example, what are the access rights for User B?","Based on the C-List example for **User B**, the access rights are: \n\n*   File 1: Read \n*   File 2: Read, Write, Execute \n*   File 3: Write \n*   File 4: Read"
"Based on the provided C-List example, what are the access rights for User C?","Based on the C-List example for **User C**, the access rights are: \n\n*   File 1: Read, Write \n*   File 2: Read \n*   File 4: Read, Write, Execute"
"How are resources managed in a Unix OS, and what are considered resources?","In a **Unix OS**, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as **resources**. These resources are the objects of access control, meaning that access to them is regulated and controlled by the system."
Describe the ownership structure of resources in a Unix OS.,"In a **Unix OS**, each resource has a single user owner and a single group owner. This ownership structure dictates who has primary control and who shares access permissions for that specific resource."
What information is typically associated with a resource in Unix OS for management purposes?,"For resource management in **Unix OS**, the following information is typically associated with a resource: \n\n*   **File type**: Indicates the nature of the resource (e.g., file, directory, socket). \n*   **File permissions**: Specifies the read, write, and execute rights. \n*   **Link counter**: The number of links, which are directory entries pointing to the file. \n*   **Username**: The owner of the resource. \n*   **Group name**: The group owner of the resource. \n*   **File size**: The size of the resource in bytes. \n*   **Modified date/time**: The timestamp of the last modification."
Define 'File type' in Unix OS and list its common examples.,"In **Unix OS**, **File type** is an attribute that indicates the nature or category of a resource. Common examples of file types include: \n\n*   '-': A regular file \n*   'd': A directory \n*   's': A socket \n*   'b': A block device file \n*   'l': A symbolic link \n*   'c': A character device file"
What is the purpose of the 'Link counter' in Unix OS resource management?,"The **Link counter** in **Unix OS** resource management indicates the number of links, which are essentially directory entries that point to a specific file. This counter helps track how many different names or paths refer to the same underlying file data."
Explain 'File permissions' in the context of Unix OS.,"**File permissions** in **Unix OS** define the access rights for a resource, specifying whether a user can read, write, or execute it. These permissions are typically set for the owner, the group, and others, controlling who can perform which operations on the file."
What does 'Owner' refer to as a type of subject?,"An **Owner** as a type of subject refers to the creator of a resource. In the context of system resources, ownership may also be attributed to a system administrator. The owner typically has the most extensive control and permissions over the resource."
What does 'Other' refer to as a type of subject?,**Other** as a type of subject refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access permissions.
What is the primary benefit of using the concept of 'groups' for managing permissions?,"The primary benefit of using the concept of **groups** for managing permissions is that it makes it easier to manage and update permissions. Instead of assigning or revoking permissions for individual users, changes can be applied to an entire group, and all members of that group will automatically inherit or lose those permissions."
What is the function of the 'Write' operation?,"The **Write** operation allows a user to modify data within a system resource. This includes making changes to files, records, or programs."
What is the function of the 'Execute' operation?,The **Execute** operation grants a user the ability to run or launch specified programs.
What is the function of the 'Delete' operation?,"The **Delete** operation permits a user to remove certain system resources, such as files or records, from the system."
What is the function of the 'Create' operation?,"The **Create** operation enables a user to bring new files, records, or fields into existence within the system."
What is the function of the 'Search' operation?,The **Search** operation allows a user to list the files contained within a directory or to otherwise search the contents of a directory.
What does each entry in an Access Control Matrix signify?,"Each entry in an **Access Control Matrix** indicates the specific access rights (or permissions) that a particular subject has for a particular object. For example, an entry might specify 'Read', 'Write', or 'Execute' permissions."
Why is an Access Control Matrix often implemented using decomposition methods like ACLs or C-Lists?,"An **Access Control Matrix** is often implemented using decomposition methods like **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** or **Capability Lists (C-Lists)** because in practice, an access control matrix is usually sparse. This means that most subjects do not have access to most objects, leading to a matrix with many empty entries. Decomposition makes the implementation more efficient and manageable."
What is the convenience of using an Access Control List (ACL)?,"The convenience of using an **Access Control List (ACL)** is that it makes it easy to determine which subjects have which access to a particular resource. Since an ACL is associated with a specific object and lists all users and their permissions for that object, it provides a clear, object-centric view of access rights."
What is the convenience of using a Capability List (C-List)?,"The convenience of using a **Capability List (C-List)** is that it makes it easy to determine the access rights available to a specific user. Since a C-List is associated with a subject and specifies all authorized objects and operations for that user, it provides a clear, subject-centric view of their capabilities."
"In Unix OS, what does the 'drwxrwxr-x' part of a file entry represent?","In **Unix OS**, the 'drwxrwxr-x' part of a file entry represents the **file type** and **file permissions**. \n\n*   The first character 'd' indicates the **file type**, meaning it is a directory. \n*   The subsequent nine characters 'rwxrwxr-x' represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. 'r' stands for read, 'w' for write, and 'x' for execute. A hyphen '-' indicates the absence of a permission. So, 'rwx' means read, write, and execute; 'r-x' means read and execute but no write."
What does the entry '-rw-rw-r--' signify for a file in Unix OS?,"The entry '-rw-rw-r--' for a file in **Unix OS** signifies both its **file type** and **file permissions**. \n\n*   The first character '-' indicates the **file type**, meaning it is a regular file. \n*   The subsequent nine characters 'rw-rw-r--' represent the permissions: \n    *   'rw-': Read and Write permissions for the owner. \n    *   'rw-': Read and Write permissions for the group. \n    *   'r--': Read permission only for others."
