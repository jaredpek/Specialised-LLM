Compare an Owner subject with a Group subject.,"An **Owner** subject is typically the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. An **Owner** is one of the three types of subjects, which are entities held accountable for the actions they initiate.\n\nA **Group** subject, in addition to individual users, allows privileges to be assigned to a collection of users. A user joining a group automatically gains the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group loses those permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups. The concept of groups simplifies the management and updating of permissions. A **Group** is also one of the three types of subjects."
What are the differences between a Group subject and an Other subject?,"A **Group** subject allows privileges to be assigned to a collection of users, making it easier to manage and update permissions. Users joining a group automatically gain its privileges, and users quitting a group lose them. A user can belong to multiple groups.\n\nAn **Other** subject is granted the least amount of access.

Compare the 'Owner' subject's accountability with the 'Group' subject's accountability.,"An **Owner** subject is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated, often as the creator of a resource or a system administrator. Accountability is tied to a specific individual or administrative role.\n\nA **Group** subject implies a collective accountability for actions initiated by its members, as privileges are assigned to the group. While individual users within the group perform actions, the group itself represents a managed set of permissions. Both **Owner** and **Group** are types of subjects, which are entities held accountable for the actions they initiate."
What are the differences between 'files' and 'directories' as resources in Unix OS?,"**Files** are uniformly treated as resources in Unix OS and are objects of access control. They represent collections of data.\n\n**Directories** are also uniformly treated as resources in Unix OS and are objects of access control. They are special types of files that contain references to other files and directories, organizing the file system hierarchy. Both have a single user owner and group owner."
Compare the 'Read' access ability to 'copy or print' with the 'Write' access ability to 'modify data'.,"**Read** access includes the ability to copy or print information. This means a subject can duplicate the content of a resource without altering the original. The primary goal is information retrieval and reproduction.\n\n**Write** access allows a subject to modify data in the system resource. This means a subject can change, add, or delete content within the resource, directly altering its state. The primary goal is data manipulation.

Compare the 'Access Control Matrix' as an implementation with the general concept of an 'access control policy'.,"An **Access Control Matrix** is described as a popular *implementation* of an access control policy. It is a specific structural and conceptual tool used to enforce access rules, detailing subjects, objects, and their rights in a tabular format.\n\nAn **access control policy** is the overarching set of rules or principles that govern how subjects are permitted to access objects. The Access Control Matrix is a concrete method for putting such a policy into practice. The matrix is a mechanism, while the policy is the guiding principle."
What are the differences between a 'system administrator' and a 'resource owner' in updating an Access Control Matrix?,"A **system administrator** is typically responsible for operations like creating subjects, creating objects, destroying subjects, and destroying objects in an Access Control Matrix. They also have the authority to grant and revoke permissions.\n\nA **resource owner** is specifically mentioned as being able to grant and revoke permissions for their resources over objects. While a system administrator has broader control over the matrix structure, a resource owner's role is focused on managing access to their specific resources. Both are subjects who can initiate actions on the matrix."
Compare the 'Owner' subject's role in system resources versus other resources.,"For general resources, an **Owner** subject may be the creator of that resource. This implies a direct relationship based on origination.\n\nFor **system resources**, ownership may specifically belong to a system administrator. This indicates a distinction where administrative roles take precedence for critical system components. An **Owner** is one of the three types of subjects, which are entities held accountable for the actions they initiate."
What are the differences between 'files' and 'portions of files' as examples of objects?,"**Files** are examples of objects, which are resources to which access is controlled. They represent complete, named collections of data.\n\n**Portions of files** are also examples of objects.

What are the differences between 'apps' and 'programs' as examples of objects?,"**Apps** are examples of objects in computer systems, which are resources to which access is controlled. This term often refers to application software.\n\n**Programs** are also examples of objects. This is a more general term for a set of instructions that a computer can execute. While 'apps' can be considered a type of 'program', the document lists them separately, implying 'apps' might refer to user-facing applications while 'programs' could encompass a broader range of executable code. Both are entities used to contain and/or receive information and are subject to access control."
Compare the 'Read' operation's focus on 'view information' with the 'Search' operation's focus on 'list files'.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource, such as the content of a file or specific fields within a record. Its primary purpose is to access and comprehend the data itself.\n\nThe **Search** operation allows a user to list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory. Its primary purpose is to discover the existence and names of resources, rather than viewing their content directly. Both are types of operations, which describe the way a subject may access an object."
What are the differences between a 'subject being held accountable' and an 'object having access controlled'?,"A **subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. This refers to the responsibility and consequences associated with the entity performing an action within the system.\n\nAn **object** is a resource to which access is controlled. This refers to the system's mechanisms for regulating which subjects can perform which operations on a given resource. The subject is the actor, and the object is the passive recipient of actions, whose accessibility is managed."
Compare the 'Group' subject's ability to manage permissions with the 'Owner' subject's direct control.,"A **Group** subject facilitates easier management and updating of permissions by assigning privileges to a collection of users. This allows for efficient, collective control over access rights, where individual users gain or lose privileges by joining or quitting the group.\n\nAn **Owner** subject, as the creator or system administrator, typically exercises direct control over a resource's permissions. Their authority is inherent to their role rather than mediated through group membership. Both **Group** and **Owner** are types of subjects, which are entities held accountable for the actions they initiate."
What are the differences between 'files' and 'records' as examples of objects?,"**Files** are examples of objects, which are resources to which access is controlled. They represent a named collection of data stored as a single unit.\n\n**Records** are also examples of objects. They typically represent structured units of information, often found within files or databases, consisting of related data fields. Both are entities used to contain and/or receive information and are subject to access control."
Compare the 'Read' operation's scope of viewing 'a file' versus 'selected fields within a record'.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource, which can include viewing **a file** in its entirety. This implies access to the complete content of the file.\n\nAlternatively, the **Read** operation can also allow viewing **selected fields within a record**. This indicates a more granular level of access, where only specific parts of a record's information are visible. Both scenarios fall under the **Read** operation, which describes the way a subject may access an object."
What are the differences between the 'Write' operation modifying 'files' versus 'programs'?,"The **Write** operation allows a user to modify data in system resources, including **files**. This means altering the content of data files.\n\nThe **Write** operation also allows a user to modify **programs**. This implies altering the executable code or configuration of a program.
