What is a subject in the context of access control?,A subject is an entity that is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a system.
"How many types of subjects are there, and what are they?","There can be three types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other."
Define the 'Owner' type of subject.,"An Owner is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator."
Explain the 'Group' type of subject and its purpose.,"A Group is a type of subject where privileges can be assigned to a collection of users, in addition to individual users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions."
What defines the 'Other' type of subject?,The 'Other' type of subject refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are granted the least amount of access.
What is an object in the context of access control?,An object is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, hard disks, printers, applications (Apps), memory, and databases."
What is the primary characteristic of an object?,The primary characteristic of an object is that it is a resource to which access is controlled.
What is an operation in access control?,An operation describes the way in which a subject may access an object.
Describe the 'Read' operation.,"The 'Read' operation allows a user to view information in a system resource. This can include viewing a file, selected records within a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination. Read access also includes the ability to copy or print."
What does the 'Write' operation allow a user to do?,"The 'Write' operation allows a user to modify data in the system resource, such as files, records, or programs."
Define the 'Execute' operation.,The 'Execute' operation allows a user to execute specified programs.
What is the purpose of the 'Delete' operation?,"The 'Delete' operation allows a user to delete certain system resources, such as files or records."
Explain the 'Create' operation.,"The 'Create' operation allows a user to create new files, records, or fields."
What does the 'Search' operation entail?,The 'Search' operation allows a user to list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory.
What is an Access Control Matrix?,An Access Control Matrix is a popular implementation of an access control policy. It is a structure used to define and manage access rights.
How is an Access Control Matrix structured?,"An Access Control Matrix is structured with two main dimensions: one dimension consists of identified subjects that may attempt access to resources, and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed."
What information does each entry in an Access Control Matrix provide?,Each entry in the Access Control Matrix indicates the access rights of a particular subject for a particular object.
"According to the example, what access rights does User A have for File 1?","According to the example Access Control Matrix, User A has 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' access rights for File 1."
"Based on the example, what access rights does User B have for File 3?","Based on the example Access Control Matrix, User B has 'Write' access rights for File 3."
What access rights does User C have for File 4 in the provided Access Control Matrix example?,"In the provided Access Control Matrix example, User C has 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' access rights for File 4."
"How is a new subject created in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this action?","To create a new subject 's' in an Access Control Matrix, a new row 's' is added. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
Describe the process of creating a new object in an Access Control Matrix.,Creating a new object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix involves creating a new column 'o'. This action is typically done by the system administrator.
"How is a permission 'r' granted for a subject 's' over an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix, and who is responsible?","To grant a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o', the permission 'r' is entered into the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This is typically done by the resource owner or the system administrator."
Explain how to revoke a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix.,"To revoke a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o', the permission 'r' is deleted from the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This is typically done by the resource owner or the system administrator."
"What happens when a subject 's' is destroyed in an Access Control Matrix, and who usually does it?","When a subject 's' is destroyed in an Access Control Matrix, the corresponding row 's' is deleted. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
How is an object 'o' destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,Destroying an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix involves deleting the corresponding column 'o'. This action is typically done by the system administrator.
What is an Access Control List (ACL) and how does it relate to an Access Control Matrix?,"An Access Control List (ACL) is an implementation method for an access control matrix, specifically by decomposition by columns. It is used in practice when an access control matrix is usually sparse."
How does an Access Control List (ACL) function for each object?,"For each object, an Access Control List (ACL) lists the users and their permitted access rights."
When is an Access Control List (ACL) particularly convenient?,An Access Control List (ACL) is convenient when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource.
"In the ACL example, what access rights does User A have for File 1?","In the ACL example, User A has 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' access rights for File 1."
"According to the ACL example, what access rights does User C have for File 2?","According to the ACL example, User C has 'Read' access rights for File 2."
What access rights does User B have for File 3 in the ACL example?,"In the ACL example, User B has 'Write' access rights for File 3."
What is a Capability List (C-List) and how does it relate to an Access Control Matrix?,"A Capability List (C-List) is an implementation method for an access control matrix, specifically by decomposition by rows. It is used in practice when an access control matrix is usually sparse."
How does a Capability List (C-List) specify access?,A Capability List (C-List) specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user.
When is a Capability List (C-List) most convenient?,A Capability List (C-List) is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user.
"In the C-List example, what access rights does User A have for File 3?","In the C-List example, User A has 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' access rights for File 3."
"According to the C-List example, what access rights does User B have for File 4?","According to the C-List example, User B has 'Read' access rights for File 4."
What access rights does User C have for File 2 in the C-List example?,"In the C-List example, User C has 'Read' access rights for File 2."
What types of entities are uniformly treated as resources in a Unix OS?,"In a Unix OS, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources."
What role do these Unix resources play in access control?,These resources in a Unix OS are the objects of access control.
How is ownership structured for resources in a Unix OS?,Each resource in a Unix OS has a single user owner and a single group owner.
What does the 'File type' field '-' indicate in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'File type' field '-' indicates a regular file."
What does the 'File type' field 'd' signify in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'File type' field 'd' signifies a directory."
What does the 'File type' field 's' represent in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'File type' field 's' represents a socket."
What does the 'File type' field 'b' denote in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'File type' field 'b' denotes a block device file."
What does the 'File type' field 'l' indicate in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'File type' field 'l' indicates a symbolic link."
What does the 'File type' field 'c' represent in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'File type' field 'c' represents a character device file."
What information is conveyed by the 'Link counter' in Unix resource management?,"The 'Link counter' in Unix resource management conveys the number of links, which are directory entries pointing to the file."
What details are included in the file permissions section of a Unix resource listing?,"The file permissions section of a Unix resource listing includes information about 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' permissions."
