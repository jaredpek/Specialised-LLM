What is a subject in the context of access control?,A subject is an entity that is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a system.
What are the three types of subjects described in access control?,"The three types of subjects described in access control are Owner, Group, and Other."
Define the 'Owner' type of subject.,"An Owner is typically the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator."
Explain the concept of a 'Group' as a type of subject.,"A Group is a category where privileges can be assigned to a collection of users, in addition to individual users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions."
What does the 'Other' subject category represent?,The 'Other' subject category refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are granted the least amount of access.
What is an object in the context of access control?,An object is a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, applications (Apps), network sockets, hard disks, printers, databases, and memory."
What is an operation in access control?,An operation describes the way in which a subject may access an object.
Describe the 'Read' operation.,"The 'Read' operation allows a user to view information in a system resource. This can include an entire file, selected records within a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination. Read access also includes the ability to copy or print."
What is the 'Write' operation?,"The 'Write' operation permits a user to modify data in a system resource, such as files, records, or programs."
Explain the 'Execute' operation.,The 'Execute' operation allows a user to execute specified programs.
What does the 'Delete' operation allow a user to do?,"The 'Delete' operation allows a user to delete certain system resources, such as files or records."
Describe the 'Create' operation.,"The 'Create' operation allows a user to create new files, records, or fields."
What is the 'Search' operation?,The 'Search' operation allows a user to list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory.
What is an Access Control Matrix?,An Access Control Matrix is a popular implementation of an access control policy. It is a conceptual structure used to define and manage access rights.
How is an Access Control Matrix structured?,"An Access Control Matrix is structured with two main dimensions: one dimension consists of identified subjects that may attempt access to resources, and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed."
What information does each entry in an Access Control Matrix contain?,Each entry in an Access Control Matrix indicates the access rights of a particular subject for a particular object.
How is a new subject created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new subject 's' in an Access Control Matrix, a new row 's' is added. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
How is a new object created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix, a new column 'o' is added. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
How is a permission granted for a subject over an object in an Access Control Matrix?,"To grant a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o', the permission 'r' is entered into the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically done by the resource owner or a system administrator."
How is a permission revoked for a subject over an object in an Access Control Matrix?,"To revoke a permission 'r' for a subject 's' over an object 'o', the permission 'r' is deleted from the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically done by the resource owner or a system administrator."
How is a subject destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"To destroy a subject 's' in an Access Control Matrix, the entire row 's' corresponding to that subject is deleted. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
How is an object destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"To destroy an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix, the entire column 'o' corresponding to that object is deleted. This action is typically done by the system administrator."
What is an Access Control List (ACL)?,"An Access Control List (ACL) is an implementation of an access control matrix achieved by decomposition by columns. For each object, an ACL lists the users and their permitted access rights."
When is an Access Control List (ACL) particularly convenient?,An Access Control List (ACL) is convenient when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource.
What is a Capability List (C-List)?,A Capability List (C-List) is an implementation of an access control matrix achieved by decomposition by rows. A C-List specifies the authorized objects and operations for a particular user.
When is a Capability List (C-List) particularly convenient?,A Capability List (C-List) is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user.
What types of entities are treated as resources in a Unix OS for resource management?,"In a Unix OS, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are the objects of access control."
How is ownership structured for resources in a Unix OS?,Each resource in a Unix OS has a single user owner and a single group owner.
"In Unix file listings, what does the '-' character at the beginning of the permissions string signify?","In Unix file listings, the '-' character at the beginning of the permissions string signifies that the entry is a regular file."
What does 'd' indicate in the file type field of a Unix resource listing?,"In a Unix resource listing, 'd' indicates that the entry is a directory."
What does 's' indicate in the file type field of a Unix resource listing?,"In a Unix resource listing, 's' indicates that the entry is a socket."
What does 'b' indicate in the file type field of a Unix resource listing?,"In a Unix resource listing, 'b' indicates that the entry is a block device file."
What does 'l' indicate in the file type field of a Unix resource listing?,"In a Unix resource listing, 'l' indicates that the entry is a symbolic link."
What does 'c' indicate in the file type field of a Unix resource listing?,"In a Unix resource listing, 'c' indicates that the entry is a character device file."
What do the file permissions 'rwx' represent in a Unix OS?,"In a Unix OS, 'rwx' represents the file permissions for read, write, and execute operations, respectively."
What is the 'Link counter' in a Unix file listing?,"The 'Link counter' in a Unix file listing indicates the number of links, which are directory entries pointing to the file."
What information does 'Modified date/time' provide in a Unix file listing?,The 'Modified date/time' in a Unix file listing provides the timestamp of when the file was last modified.
What does 'File size' represent in a Unix file listing?,The 'File size' in a Unix file listing represents the size of the file in bytes.
What does the 'Username' field indicate in a Unix file listing?,The 'Username' field in a Unix file listing indicates the user owner of the resource.
What does the 'Group name' field indicate in a Unix file listing?,The 'Group name' field in a Unix file listing indicates the group owner of the resource.
What is a popular implementation of an access control policy?,A popular implementation of an access control policy is the Access Control Matrix.
"How can an access control matrix be implemented in practice, especially if it is sparse?","In practice, an access control matrix, especially if sparse, can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways: by columns, which leads to an Access Control List (ACL), or by rows, which leads to a Capability List (C-List)."
What is the fundamental difference in perspective between an Access Control List (ACL) and a Capability List (C-List)?,"An Access Control List (ACL) is a decomposition by columns, meaning it lists for each object which users have permitted access rights. A Capability List (C-List) is a decomposition by rows, meaning it specifies for each user which authorized objects and operations they can perform."
What role does a system administrator typically play in updating an Access Control Matrix?,"A system administrator typically performs actions such as creating new subjects, creating new objects, destroying subjects, and destroying objects in an Access Control Matrix. They can also grant and revoke permissions."
What role does a resource owner typically play in updating an Access Control Matrix?,A resource owner typically has the authority to grant and revoke permissions for their specific resources within an Access Control Matrix.
How are privileges assigned to individual users versus groups of users?,"Privileges can be assigned to individual users, but they can also be assigned to a group of users. When privileges are assigned to a group, a user joining that group automatically inherits the corresponding privileges, and a user leaving the group loses those permissions."
What is the primary benefit of using groups in access control?,"The primary benefit of using groups in access control is that it makes it easier to manage and update permissions, as changes can be applied to the group rather than to individual users."
What level of access is typically granted to 'Other' subjects?,The 'Other' subject category is granted the least amount of access compared to Owners and Groups for a given resource.
"How do various components like Apps, Memory, and Hard Disk relate to 'Computer Systems' in the context of objects?","In the context of objects, Apps, Network sockets, Hard disks, Printers, Databases, and Memory are all examples of resources within 'Computer Systems' to which access is controlled, making them objects."
