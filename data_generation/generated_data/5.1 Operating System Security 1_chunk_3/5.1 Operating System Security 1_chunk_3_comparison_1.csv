Compare a subject with an object in the context of access control.,"A **subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. There can be three types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other. An **object** is a resource to which access is controlled, and it is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs."
What are the differences between an Owner and a Group as types of subjects?,"An **Owner** is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. A **Group** is another type of subject where, in addition to individual users, privileges can also be assigned to a group of users. A user joining the group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups, and the concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions."
Compare the 'Group' subject type with the 'Other' subject type.,"The **Group** subject type refers to a collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned. Users automatically gain or lose privileges upon joining or quitting a group, respectively, and a user can be part of multiple groups, which streamlines permission management. In contrast, the **Other** subject type is granted the least amount of access and includes users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource."
Compare the 'Read' operation with the 'Write' operation in terms of subject access to an object.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource (e.g., a file, selected records in a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination). Read access includes the ability to copy or print. The **Write** operation, on the other hand, permits a user to modify data in the system resource (e.g., files, records, programs)."
What are the differences between the 'Execute' and 'Delete' operations?,"The **Execute** operation allows a user to execute specified programs. In contrast, the **Delete** operation grants a user the ability to delete certain system resources, such as files or records."
Compare the 'Create subject' operation with the 'Destroy subject' operation in the context of updating an Access Control Matrix.,"To **Create subject s** involves adding a new row 's' to the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator. Conversely, to **Destroy subject s** means to delete the row 's' from the matrix, an action also typically carried out by the system administrator. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy where one dimension consists of identified subjects and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed, with each entry indicating access rights."
What is the difference between creating an object and destroying an object in an Access Control Matrix?,"To **Create object o** in an Access Control Matrix involves adding a new column 'o' to the matrix, a task typically handled by the system administrator. Conversely, to **Destroy object o** means to delete the column 'o' from the matrix, which is also typically done by the system administrator. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy where one dimension lists identified subjects and the other lists objects, with entries indicating access rights."
Compare granting a permission with revoking a permission for a subject over an object in an Access Control Matrix.,"To **Grant permission r for subject s over object o** means to enter the permission 'r' into the entry M_s,o of the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically performed by the resource owner or system administrator. In contrast, to **Revoke permission r for subject s over object o** involves deleting the permission 'r' from the entry M_s,o of the matrix, an action also typically carried out by the resource owner or system administrator. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy that uses identified subjects and objects to define access rights."
Compare an Access Control Matrix with an Access Control List (ACL).,"An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy where one dimension consists of identified subjects and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed. Each entry in the matrix indicates the access rights of a particular subject for a particular object. An **Access Control List (ACL)** is an implementation of an access control matrix achieved by decomposition by columns. For each object, an ACL lists the users and their permitted access rights. ACLs are convenient for determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource."
What are the differences between an Access Control Matrix and a Capability List (C-List)?,"An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy that uses identified subjects and objects to define access rights, with each entry specifying a subject's rights for an object. A **Capability List (C-List)** is an implementation of an access control matrix achieved by decomposition by rows. A C-list specifies the authorized objects and operations for a particular user. C-Lists are convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user."
Compare an Access Control List (ACL) with a Capability List (C-List).,"Both **Access Control List (ACL)** and **Capability List (C-List)** are ways to implement an access control matrix, which is a popular implementation of an access control policy. An ACL is a decomposition of the matrix by columns, where for each object, it lists users and their permitted access rights, making it convenient for determining which subjects have access to a particular resource. A C-List, on the other hand, is a decomposition of the matrix by rows, specifying authorized objects and operations for a particular user, making it convenient for determining the access rights available to a specific user."
Compare the 'Read' operation with the 'Search' operation.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource (e.g., a file, selected records in a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination), and includes the ability to copy or print. The **Search** operation, in contrast, allows a user to list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory."
What are the differences between a file and a directory in Unix OS resource management?,"In Unix OS resource management, both files and directories are treated as **resources**, which are objects of access control. A **file** is a basic unit for storing data, indicated by '-' in the file type. A **directory**, indicated by 'd' in the file type, is a special type of file that contains references to other files and directories, organizing the file system hierarchy."
Compare a block device file with a character device file in Unix OS.,"In Unix OS, both **block device files** (indicated by 'b') and **character device files** (indicated by 'c') are types of resources that are objects of access control. A block device file typically refers to devices that transfer data in fixed-size blocks. A character device file, in contrast, refers to devices that transfer data character by character."
Compare the 'Owner' subject type with the 'Other' subject type.,"An **Owner** is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource, or for system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. This subject typically has extensive control over the resource. In contrast, the **Other** subject type refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource, and they are granted the least amount of access."
Explain the relationship between 'Read' access and the ability to 'copy or print'.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource. This access explicitly includes the ability to copy or print the information. Therefore, 'copy or print' are specific actions encompassed within the broader 'Read' access privilege."
Compare a 'Subject' with an 'Operation' in access control.,"A **Subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated, representing an entity that requests access to resources. Examples include Owners, Groups, and Others. An **Operation**, on the other hand, describes the specific way in which a subject may access an object. Examples of operations include Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Create, and Search."
What are the differences between an 'Object' and an 'Operation' in a computer system?,"An **Object** is a resource to which access is controlled, serving as an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples include files, records, and programs. An **Operation** describes the specific way a subject may interact with an object, defining the type of access allowed. Examples of operations include Read, Write, and Execute."
Compare the 'Create' operation with the 'Write' operation.,"The **Create** operation allows a user to create new files, records, or fields. This focuses on the initial generation of a resource. The **Write** operation, in contrast, allows a user to modify data in the system resource (e.g., files, records, programs), focusing on altering content rather than initial creation."
Compare the 'Delete' operation with 'Revoke permission'.,"The **Delete** operation is a type of access operation that allows a user to delete certain system resources, such as files or records, effectively removing the object itself. **Revoke permission r for subject s over object o**, on the other hand, is an operation performed on an Access Control Matrix to remove a specific access right 'r' from an entry M_s,o, meaning the subject 's' loses a particular permission to an object 'o', but the object itself is not necessarily deleted. Revoking permission is about changing access rights, while deleting is about removing the resource."
Compare the general concept of an Access Control Matrix with how resource management is handled in a Unix OS.,"An **Access Control Matrix** is a conceptual model and popular implementation of an access control policy, where subjects are listed on one dimension and objects on another, with entries defining specific access rights. In **Unix OS Resource Management**, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as **resources**, which are the objects of access control. Each resource in Unix has a single user owner and group owner, which aligns with the subject types (Owner, Group) in an access control model. Unix OS uses file permissions (read/write/execute) to define access, which are specific **operations** that subjects can perform on objects, effectively implementing an access control policy."
Compare Unix file permissions with the general concept of operations.,"In Unix OS, **file permissions** are specific access rights granted to subjects (owner, group, others) over resources like files and directories, typically including read, write, and execute. These permissions are a practical implementation of **operations**, which generally describe the way a subject may access an object. The general operations defined include Read (view, copy, print), Write (modify data), and Execute (run programs), which directly correspond to the read, write, and execute permissions seen in Unix systems."
Compare the 'Link counter' with 'File size' in Unix OS resource management.,"In Unix OS resource management, the **Link counter** indicates the number of links (i.e., directory entries) pointing to the file. This essentially tracks how many different names or paths refer to the same underlying file data. The **File size**, in contrast, indicates the amount of storage space the file occupies, as shown in the example output."
Compare 'Username' with 'Group name' in Unix OS resource management.,"In Unix OS resource management, each resource has a single user owner and group owner. The **Username** identifies the specific user who is the owner of the resource, corresponding to the 'Owner' subject type. The **Group name** identifies the specific group that is the owner of the resource, corresponding to the 'Group' subject type. Both are crucial for determining access rights based on the subject's identity."
Compare the general definition of 'Read' access with 'Read' permission in Unix.,"The general definition of **Read access** allows a user to view information in a system resource, including the ability to copy or print. In Unix OS, **Read permission** (represented as 'r' in file permissions) is the specific implementation of this general concept for files and directories. When a subject has read permission on a Unix file, they can view its contents, aligning directly with the general definition of reading information."
Compare the general definition of 'Write' access with 'Write' permission in Unix.,"The general definition of **Write access** allows a user to modify data in a system resource, such as files, records, or programs. In Unix OS, **Write permission** (represented as 'w' in file permissions) is the specific implementation of this general concept for files and directories. When a subject has write permission on a Unix file, they can modify its contents, aligning directly with the general definition of writing data."
Compare the general definition of 'Execute' access with 'Execute' permission in Unix.,"The general definition of **Execute access** allows a user to execute specified programs. In Unix OS, **Execute permission** (represented as 'x' in file permissions) is the specific implementation of this general concept for files and directories. For a file, execute permission allows it to be run as a program. For a directory, it allows a user to traverse into it, aligning directly with the general definition of executing."
Compare 'files' with 'programs' as examples of objects.,"Both **files** and **programs** are examples of **objects**, which are resources to which access is controlled and entities used to contain and/or receive information. A file is a general term for a collection of data or information stored in a computer system. A program is a specific type of file that contains instructions that can be executed by a computer, often requiring 'Execute' access in addition to 'Read' access."
What are the differences between 'records' and 'fields' as objects?,"Both **records** and **fields** are examples of **objects**, which are resources to which access is controlled. A record is a collection of related data items treated as a unit, often composed of multiple fields. A field is a single piece of data within a record. For instance, the 'Read' operation can apply to selected records in a file or selected fields within a record, indicating that fields are granular components of records."
Compare 'directories' with 'directory trees' as examples of objects.,"Both **directories** and **directory trees** are examples of **objects**, which are resources to which access is controlled and entities used to contain and/or receive information. A directory is a container for organizing files and other directories. A directory tree refers to a hierarchical structure formed by a directory and all its subdirectories and files, representing a larger organizational unit within a file system."
Compare 'mailboxes' with 'messages' as examples of objects.,"Both **mailboxes** and **messages** are examples of **objects**, which are resources to which access is controlled and entities used to contain and/or receive information. A mailbox is a storage location for electronic messages. A message is a discrete unit of communication or information that is typically stored within a mailbox or transmitted between systems."
"Compare the implications of 'Read' access that includes copying or printing, with 'Write' access that allows modification.","The **Read** operation, which includes the ability to copy or print, implies that a subject can duplicate or output the information from a resource without altering the original content. This focuses on information dissemination. In contrast, the **Write** operation allows a subject to modify data in the system resource, meaning they can change, add, or delete content within the original resource, directly affecting its state."
Compare the convenience aspects of an Access Control List (ACL) versus a Capability List (C-List).,"An **Access Control List (ACL)** is convenient when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource, as it lists users and their permitted access rights for each object. A **Capability List (C-List)**, on the other hand, is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user, as it specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user."
Compare the roles of a 'system administrator' and a 'resource owner' in updating an Access Control Matrix.,"In updating an **Access Control Matrix**, the **system administrator** is typically responsible for operations such as creating new subjects (adding rows), creating new objects (adding columns), destroying subjects (deleting rows), and destroying objects (deleting columns). The **resource owner** shares responsibility with the system administrator for granting and revoking permissions for a subject over an object, specifically by entering or deleting permissions in the matrix entries."
Compare an 'Access Control Policy' with an 'Access Control Matrix'.,"An **Access Control Policy** is a set of rules that dictates how access to resources is managed and controlled. An **Access Control Matrix** is described as a popular implementation of an access control policy. It is a structured representation where one dimension lists identified subjects and the other lists objects, with each entry indicating the access rights of a particular subject for a particular object, thereby enforcing the policy."
Compare the concept of 'subject accountability' with 'object control'.,"A **subject** is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated, meaning they are responsible for their interactions with resources. An **object** is a resource to which access is controlled, meaning mechanisms are in place to regulate who can interact with it and in what ways. So, accountability relates to the actor, while control relates to the resource being acted upon."
What is the difference between a Unix file type indicated by '-' and one indicated by 'd'?,"In Unix OS resource management, the file type indicated by '-' denotes a regular **file**, which is a basic unit for storing data. The file type indicated by 'd' denotes a **directory**, which is a special type of file used to organize other files and directories."
Compare a Unix file type 's' with a Unix file type 'l'.,"In Unix OS resource management, the file type 's' indicates a **socket**, which is a special file used for inter-process communication. The file type 'l' indicates a **symbolic link**, which is a special file that points to another file or directory."
Compare a Unix file type 'b' with a Unix file type 'c'.,"In Unix OS resource management, the file type 'b' indicates a **block device file**, which represents a device that handles data in blocks. The file type 'c' indicates a **character device file**, which represents a device that handles data character by character."
Compare the decomposition method for Access Control Lists (ACLs) with that for Capability Lists (C-Lists).,"Both **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and **Capability Lists (C-Lists)** are implementations of an access control matrix when it is sparse. An ACL is implemented by **decomposition by columns**, meaning for each object, it lists the users and their permitted access rights. A C-List is implemented by **decomposition by rows**, meaning for each subject (user), it specifies the authorized objects and operations."
"Compare the purpose of file permissions (Read/Write/Execute) with file metadata like Link counter, File size, and Modified date/time in Unix OS.","**File permissions** (Read/Write/Execute) define the specific operations that subjects (owner, group, others) are allowed to perform on a resource, directly controlling access. In contrast, **file metadata** such as the **Link counter** (number of directory entries pointing to the file), **File size** (amount of storage), and **Modified date/time** (last modification timestamp) provide descriptive information about the resource itself, rather than directly controlling access. While metadata can be used by access control systems, its primary purpose is descriptive."
Compare the general concept of an 'Owner' subject with a 'Username' in Unix OS.,"An **Owner** is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource or a system administrator, typically having primary control. A **Username** in Unix OS resource management is the specific identifier for the user who is designated as the owner of a resource. Thus, the Username is the concrete representation of the Owner subject type within the Unix system, linking a specific user identity to the ownership role."
Compare the general concept of a 'Group' subject with a 'Group name' in Unix OS.,"A **Group** is a type of subject where privileges are assigned to a collection of users, simplifying permission management. A **Group name** in Unix OS resource management is the specific identifier for the group that is designated as the group owner of a resource. Therefore, the Group name is the concrete representation of the Group subject type within the Unix system, linking a specific group identity to the group ownership role."
Compare the general concept of an Access Control Matrix with its sparse implementation using ACLs or C-Lists.,"An **Access Control Matrix** is a conceptual model that provides a comprehensive view of all subjects, objects, and their corresponding access rights. In practice, this matrix is often **sparse**, meaning most entries are empty (no access rights). To implement a sparse matrix efficiently, it can be decomposed into either **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, which are column-wise lists of subjects and their rights for each object, or **Capability Lists (C-Lists)**, which are row-wise lists of objects and operations for each subject. These decompositions are practical implementations that optimize storage and retrieval for sparse matrices."
Compare the 'view information' aspect of the Read operation with the 'list files' aspect of the Search operation.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information within a system resource, such as the content of a file or specific data within a record. This implies inspecting the actual data. The **Search** operation, on the other hand, allows a user to list the files in a directory or otherwise search the directory, which primarily involves enumerating or locating resources rather than viewing their content directly."
"Compare the action of 'modifying data' (Write operation) with 'creating new files, records, or fields' (Create operation).","The **Write** operation allows a user to modify existing data within a system resource, such as altering the content of a file or changing values in a record. This action presupposes the existence of the resource. In contrast, the **Create** operation allows a user to bring new resources into existence, such as generating new files, records, or fields, which is about initial resource generation rather than alteration of existing ones."
Compare the ownership of 'system resources' with 'general resources' by an Owner.,"An **Owner** is typically the creator of a resource. For **general resources**, the owner is usually the individual who created it. However, for **system resources**, ownership may specifically belong to a system administrator, indicating a distinction in who holds the ownership role depending on the nature of the resource."
Compare the impact of a user joining a group versus a user quitting a group on their privileges.,"When a user **joins a group**, they will automatically have the corresponding privileges assigned to that group. Conversely, when a user **quits a group**, they will lose the corresponding permissions associated with that group. This mechanism simplifies privilege management for individual users by associating them with group-level access rights."
Compare managing permissions using the concept of 'groups' versus managing permissions for individual users.,"The concept of **groups** makes it easier to manage and update permissions. Instead of assigning privileges to individual users one by one, permissions can be assigned to a group of users. A user joining or quitting the group automatically gains or loses the corresponding privileges. This is more efficient than **managing individual user permissions**, which would require separately assigning and revoking privileges for each user, especially when dealing with many users and resources."
Compare how subjects and objects are represented in a general Access Control Matrix versus in Unix OS resource management.,"In a general **Access Control Matrix**, one dimension consists of identified **subjects** (e.g., User A, User B, User C) and the other dimension lists **objects** (e.g., File 1, File 2). Each entry specifies access rights. In **Unix OS resource management**, the **objects** are resources like files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices. The **subjects** are implicitly represented by the single user owner and group owner assigned to each resource, which correspond to the 'Owner' and 'Group' subject types, along with 'Other' for users not in those categories. Unix uses specific file permissions (read/write/execute) to define the access rights."
Compare the 'Read' operation with the 'Execute' operation.,"The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource, including the ability to copy or print. This focuses on passive consumption of information. The **Execute** operation, on the other hand, allows a user to run specified programs, which is an active process that initiates a task or application."
Compare the 'Write' operation with the 'Create' operation.,"The **Write** operation allows a user to modify existing data in a system resource (e.g., files, records, programs). This implies altering content of an already existing object. The **Create** operation, in contrast, allows a user to create new files, records, or fields, which means bringing a new object into existence."
Compare the 'Delete' operation with the 'Destroy object' operation in an Access Control Matrix context.,"The **Delete** operation is a general access right that allows a user to remove certain system resources, such as files or records. This is an operation a subject can perform on an object. The **Destroy object o** operation, however, is a specific administrative action performed on an **Access Control Matrix** to delete an entire column 'o', effectively removing the object 'o' from the access control system and all its associated permissions. While both result in the removal of an object, 'Delete' is a user-level operation on a resource, and 'Destroy object' is an administrative operation on the access control policy itself."
Compare the 'Delete' operation with the 'Destroy subject' operation in an Access Control Matrix context.,"The **Delete** operation is a general access right that allows a user to remove certain system resources, such as files or records. This operation targets an object. The **Destroy subject s** operation, however, is a specific administrative action performed on an **Access Control Matrix** to delete an entire row 's', effectively removing the subject 's' from the access control system and all its associated permissions to objects. While 'Delete' removes an object, 'Destroy subject' removes an entity that initiates actions."
Compare the 'Owner' subject type with the 'System Administrator' role for system resources.,"An **Owner** is a type of subject typically held accountable for actions initiated on a resource. For **system resources**, ownership may specifically belong to a **system administrator**. This indicates that while 'Owner' is a general role, for critical system-level resources, the specific individual or entity fulfilling that 'Owner' role is often the system administrator, who has elevated privileges and responsibilities."
"Compare the 'Read' operation's scope (file, records, fields) with the 'Search' operation's scope (directory).","The **Read** operation allows a user to view information within a system resource, with its scope extending to a whole file, selected records within a file, or selected fields within a record. This implies granular access to content. The **Search** operation, in contrast, has a scope primarily focused on directories, allowing a user to list files within a directory or otherwise search the directory structure itself, rather than the content of individual files or records."
Compare the 'modify data' aspect of the Write operation with the 'delete certain system resources' aspect of the Delete operation.,"The **Write** operation allows a user to modify existing data in a system resource, which means altering its content without necessarily removing the resource itself. This focuses on changing information. The **Delete** operation, conversely, allows a user to delete certain system resources, such as files or records, which means removing the entire resource from the system. This focuses on resource removal rather than content alteration."
Compare the 'add a new row s' action for 'Create subject s' with the 'delete the row s' action for 'Destroy subject s'.,"The 'Create subject s' operation involves the action of **adding a new row s** to the Access Control Matrix, which represents the introduction of a new subject into the system. Conversely, the 'Destroy subject s' operation involves the action of **deleting the row s** from the Access Control Matrix, which represents the complete removal of a subject from the system's access control policy. Both actions are typically performed by the system administrator."
Compare the 'add a new column o' action for 'Create object o' with the 'deletes the column o' action for 'Destroy object o'.,"The 'Create object o' operation involves the action of **adding a new column o** to the Access Control Matrix, which represents the introduction of a new object into the system. Conversely, the 'Destroy object o' operation involves the action of **deleting the column o** from the Access Control Matrix, which represents the complete removal of an object from the system's access control policy. Both actions are typically performed by the system administrator."
