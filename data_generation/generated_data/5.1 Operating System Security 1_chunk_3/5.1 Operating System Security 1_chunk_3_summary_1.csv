Provide a comprehensive summary of what a subject is in access control.,"A subject is an entity that is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a system. There are three primary types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other. An Owner is typically the creator of a resource, or for system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. A Group refers to a collection of individual users to whom privileges can be assigned. Users joining a group will automatically have the corresponding privileges, while a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups, and this concept makes it easier to manage and update permissions. Other refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource, and they are granted the least amount of access."
Can you summarise the different types of subjects involved in access control?,"In access control, there are three distinct types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other. An Owner is the entity, often the creator of a resource or a system administrator for system resources, who holds primary ownership. A Group is a collection of individual users where privileges are assigned collectively. Users automatically gain or lose privileges by joining or leaving a group, respectively, and can be members of multiple groups, which streamlines permission management. Other subjects are users who have system access but are not designated as the Owner or part of any Group for a particular resource, and they are typically granted the minimum level of access."
Define the term 'Owner' in the context of access control subjects.,"In access control, an Owner is a type of subject that typically refers to the creator of a resource. For system resources, the ownership may instead belong to a system administrator. The Owner is held accountable for actions initiated regarding the resource they own."
Explain the concept of a 'Group' as a type of subject in access control.,"A Group, in the context of access control subjects, is a collection of individual users to whom privileges can be assigned collectively. When a user joins a group, they automatically acquire the corresponding privileges. Conversely, if a user quits a group, they lose those permissions. A user has the flexibility to belong to multiple groups. The primary benefit of the group concept is that it simplifies the management and updating of permissions across multiple users."
What does 'Other' signify as a subject type in access control?,"As a subject type in access control, 'Other' refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the specific categories of Owner or Group for a particular resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access compared to Owners or Group members."
Provide a definition of an 'object' in the context of access control.,"An object, in access control, is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs."
List various examples of objects that are subject to access control.,"Objects subject to access control are resources that contain or receive information. Specific examples include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, hard disks, printers, applications (Apps), memory, and databases."
Summarize what an 'Operation' describes in access control.,An Operation in access control describes the specific way in which a subject may access an object. These operations define the permissible actions that can be performed on a resource.
Describe the 'Read' operation in access control.,"The 'Read' operation allows a user to view information contained within a system resource. This can apply to an entire file, selected records in a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination. Read access also encompasses the ability to copy or print the information."
Explain the 'Write' operation in access control.,"The 'Write' operation permits a user to modify data within a system resource. This includes altering files, records, or programs."
What is the 'Execute' operation in access control?,The 'Execute' operation grants a user the ability to run specified programs.
Define the 'Delete' operation in access control.,"The 'Delete' operation allows a user to remove certain system resources, such as files or records."
Describe the 'Create' operation in access control.,"The 'Create' operation enables a user to generate new files, records, or fields within the system."
Explain the 'Search' operation in access control.,The 'Search' operation allows a user to list the files within a directory or to otherwise search the directory.
Summarize the purpose and structure of an Access Control Matrix.,"An Access Control Matrix is a popular implementation of an access control policy. Its purpose is to define and enforce access rights between subjects and objects. The matrix has two dimensions: one dimension consists of identified subjects that may attempt access to the resources, and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed. Each entry within the matrix indicates the specific access rights of a particular subject for a particular object."
What are the two dimensions of an Access Control Matrix?,"The two dimensions of an Access Control Matrix are: one dimension consists of identified subjects that may attempt access to resources, and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed. Subjects are entities held accountable for actions they initiate, while objects are resources to which access is controlled."
What does an entry in an Access Control Matrix represent?,"An entry in an Access Control Matrix indicates the specific access rights of a particular subject for a particular object. For example, an entry might specify 'Read', 'Write', or 'Execute' permissions."
How is a new subject created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new subject, denoted as 's', in an Access Control Matrix, a new row 's' is added to the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
How is a new object created in an Access Control Matrix?,"To create a new object, denoted as 'o', in an Access Control Matrix, a new column 'o' is added to the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
Explain how to grant a permission in an Access Control Matrix.,"To grant a permission, denoted as 'r', for a subject 's' over an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix, the permission 'r' is entered into the corresponding entry M_s,o. This operation is typically carried out by either the resource owner or the system administrator."
Describe the process of revoking a permission in an Access Control Matrix.,"To revoke a permission, denoted as 'r', for a subject 's' over an object 'o' in an Access Control Matrix, the permission 'r' is deleted from the corresponding entry M_s,o. This action is typically performed by the resource owner or the system administrator."
How is a subject destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"To destroy a subject, denoted as 's', in an Access Control Matrix, the entire row corresponding to subject 's' is deleted from the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
How is an object destroyed in an Access Control Matrix?,"To destroy an object, denoted as 'o', in an Access Control Matrix, the entire column corresponding to object 'o' is deleted from the matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator."
Who is typically responsible for making changes to an Access Control Matrix?,"Changes to an Access Control Matrix are typically performed by either the system administrator or the resource owner. For actions like creating or destroying subjects and objects, the system administrator is usually responsible. For granting or revoking specific permissions, both the resource owner and the system administrator may be involved."
Provide a definition of an Access Control List (ACL).,"An Access Control List (ACL) is an implementation method for an access control policy, specifically a decomposition of an access control matrix by columns. For each object, an ACL lists the users (subjects) and their permitted access rights. This approach is convenient for determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource (object)."
How does an Access Control List (ACL) relate to an Access Control Matrix?,"An Access Control List (ACL) is one way to implement an access control matrix, specifically by decomposing it by columns. While an Access Control Matrix represents all subjects and objects in a single table, an ACL focuses on individual objects, listing for each object the subjects and their specific access rights. This makes ACLs particularly useful for determining access to a specific resource."
What is the primary benefit of using an Access Control List (ACL)?,"The primary benefit of using an Access Control List (ACL) is its convenience when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource (object). Since an ACL lists, for each object, the users and their permitted access rights, it provides a direct way to check permissions for a given resource."
Provide a definition of a Capability List (C-List).,"A Capability List (C-List) is an implementation method for an access control policy, specifically a decomposition of an access control matrix by rows. For each user (subject), a C-List specifies the authorized objects and the operations that the user can perform on them. This approach is convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user (subject)."
How does a Capability List (C-List) relate to an Access Control Matrix?,"A Capability List (C-List) is another way to implement an access control matrix, specifically by decomposing it by rows. Unlike an Access Control Matrix which is a comprehensive table, a C-List focuses on individual subjects, listing for each subject the objects they can access and the operations they are authorized to perform. This makes C-Lists particularly useful for determining the access rights available to a specific user."
What is the primary benefit of using a Capability List (C-List)?,"The primary benefit of using a Capability List (C-List) is its convenience when determining the access rights available to a specific user (subject). Since a C-List specifies, for each user, the authorized objects and operations, it provides a direct way to check what a particular user is allowed to do."
Explain the two primary ways an access control matrix can be decomposed for practical implementation.,"An access control matrix, which can often be sparse in practice, can be implemented by decomposition in two primary ways: Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Capability Lists (C-Lists). Access Control Lists (ACLs) represent a decomposition by columns, where for each object, a list specifies the users and their permitted access rights. Capability Lists (C-Lists) represent a decomposition by rows, where for each user, a list specifies the authorized objects and the operations that user can perform."
Summarize how resources are managed in a Unix OS from an access control perspective.,"In a Unix OS, various entities such as files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are considered the objects of access control. Each resource in Unix has a single user owner and a single group owner, which are types of subjects responsible for initiating actions and managing access."
What types of entities are considered resources and objects of access control in a Unix OS?,"In a Unix OS, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are the specific objects of access control, meaning that access to them is controlled and managed."
Describe the ownership model for resources in a Unix OS.,"In a Unix OS, each resource has a single user owner and a single group owner. The user owner is an individual subject, while the group owner is a group subject, both of whom are held accountable for actions initiated on that resource and have specific privileges."
List the different file type indicators used in Unix OS resource management.,"In Unix OS resource management, various indicators denote file types: '-' signifies a regular file, 'd' indicates a directory, 's' represents a socket, 'b' denotes a block device file, 'l' stands for a symbolic link, and 'c' identifies a character device file."
What are the basic file permissions in Unix OS?,"The basic file permissions in Unix OS are Read, Write, and Execute. These permissions define the specific operations that subjects (owners, groups, others) can perform on a resource. Read allows viewing, Write allows modifying, and Execute allows running programs."
Identify the key components typically displayed for a resource entry in a Unix OS.,"A typical resource entry in a Unix OS displays several key components: the File type (e.g., file, directory, socket), File permissions (Read, Write, Execute), Link counter (the number of directory entries pointing to the file), Username (the user owner), Group name (the group owner), File size, and the Modified date/time."
What is the 'Link counter' in Unix resource management?,"In Unix resource management, the 'Link counter' indicates the number of links, specifically the number of directory entries, that point to a particular file. This count helps manage references to the file within the file system."
What role does a system administrator typically play in managing an Access Control Matrix?,"A system administrator typically plays a crucial role in managing an Access Control Matrix. They are usually responsible for creating new subjects and objects by adding rows and columns, respectively. They also have the authority to destroy subjects and objects by deleting their corresponding rows and columns. Furthermore, system administrators can grant and revoke permissions for subjects over objects."
What role does a resource owner typically play in managing an Access Control Matrix?,"A resource owner typically plays a role in managing an Access Control Matrix by being able to grant and revoke permissions for subjects over objects that they own. This allows them to control access to their specific resources, in conjunction with the system administrator."
"Explain the fundamental relationship between a subject, an object, and an operation in access control.","In access control, the fundamental relationship is that a subject initiates an action, an object is the resource upon which the action is performed, and an operation describes the specific way the subject may access the object. A subject is held accountable for actions it initiates, an object is a resource to which access is controlled, and an operation defines the permissible actions like Read, Write, or Execute."
How does the concept of 'groups' simplify permission management?,"The concept of 'groups' simplifies permission management by allowing privileges to be assigned to a collection of users rather than to each individual user separately. When a user joins a group, they automatically inherit its privileges, and when they leave, they lose them. This makes it easier to manage and update permissions, as changes only need to be applied to the group, and all its members are affected accordingly."
What specific capabilities are included under 'Read' access?,"Under 'Read' access, a user is granted the ability to view information in a system resource. This capability specifically includes the ability to copy or print the information from the resource."
What is the key difference in perspective between an Access Control List (ACL) and a Capability List (C-List)?,"The key difference in perspective between an Access Control List (ACL) and a Capability List (C-List) lies in their organization. An ACL is object-centric, listing for each object the subjects and their permitted access rights. In contrast, a C-List is subject-centric, listing for each subject the authorized objects and the operations that the user can perform. ACLs are convenient for checking access to a specific resource, while C-Lists are convenient for checking a specific user's available access rights."
"Why are files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices uniformly treated as resources in Unix OS?","Files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources in Unix OS because they all function as objects of access control. This uniform treatment allows for a consistent and centralized approach to managing permissions and controlling access across various types of system components."
"In Unix OS, what are the roles of the 'Username' and 'Group name' displayed for a resource?","In Unix OS, the 'Username' displayed for a resource identifies the single user owner of that resource, while the 'Group name' identifies the single group owner. Both the user owner and the group owner are types of subjects that have specific access rights and accountability for actions initiated on the resource."
What information do 'File size' and 'Modified date/time' provide for a Unix resource?,"For a Unix resource, 'File size' indicates the size of the resource in bytes. 'Modified date/time' specifies the exact date and time when the resource was last altered. Both are key attributes displayed for resource management."
What is the primary characteristic that defines a 'subject' in access control?,The primary characteristic that defines a 'subject' in access control is that it is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated. This accountability is central to managing security and permissions within a system.
What kind of entity is an object used for in access control?,"In access control, an object is an entity specifically used to contain and/or receive information. This characteristic defines its role as a resource that requires controlled access."
What is an Access Control Matrix considered to be in terms of access control policy?,An Access Control Matrix is considered a popular implementation of an access control policy. It provides a structured way to define and enforce rules governing how subjects can interact with objects.
