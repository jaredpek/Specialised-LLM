"Define the concept of a ""subject"" in the context of access control.",A **subject** is an entity that is typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated within a system. Subjects are active entities that perform operations on objects.
What are the three types of subjects identified in access control?,"There are three types of subjects identified in access control: **Owner**, **Group**, and **Other**."
"Define an ""Owner"" subject.","An **Owner** is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource. For system resources, ownership may also belong to a system administrator."
"Explain the concept of a ""Group"" subject and its purpose.","A **Group** is a type of subject where privileges can be assigned to a collection of users, in addition to individual users. The concept of groups makes it easier to manage and update permissions because a user joining the group will automatically receive the corresponding privileges, and a user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions. A user may belong to multiple groups."
"Describe the ""Other"" subject type.",**Other** refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are typically granted the least amount of access.
How does a user's membership in a group affect their privileges?,"A user's membership in a group directly affects their privileges. When a user joins a group, they will automatically have the corresponding privileges assigned to that group. Conversely, if a user quits the group, they will lose the corresponding permissions."
Can a user belong to multiple groups?,"Yes, a user may belong to multiple groups. This allows for flexible assignment and management of privileges based on various group affiliations."
"Define what an ""object"" is in the context of access control.",An **object** is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information.
Provide examples of objects in a computer system.,"Examples of objects in a computer system include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, and programs."
"List the various components of computer systems that can function as objects, as illustrated in the provided diagram.","The various components of computer systems that can function as objects include Apps, Network sockets, Memory, Databases, Hard disks, and Printers."
"Define ""Operation"" in the context of access control.",An **Operation** describes the way in which a subject may access an object. These operations define the specific actions a subject is permitted to perform on a resource.
"Describe the ""Read"" operation and what it encompasses.","The **Read** operation allows a user to view information in a system resource. This can include viewing an entire file, selected records in a file, selected fields within a record, or some combination. Read access also includes the ability to copy or print the information."
"Define the ""Write"" operation.","The **Write** operation allows a user to modify data in a system resource. This applies to various resources such as files, records, or programs."
"Explain the ""Execute"" operation.",The **Execute** operation permits a user to run or execute specified programs.
"What does the ""Delete"" operation allow a user to do?","The **Delete** operation allows a user to remove or delete certain system resources, such as files or records."
"Describe the ""Create"" operation.","The **Create** operation enables a user to generate new files, records, or fields within the system."
"Define the ""Search"" operation.",The **Search** operation allows a user to list the files within a directory or otherwise search the directory for specific resources.
List all the operations a subject may perform to access an object.,"The operations a subject may perform to access an object include: **Read**, which allows viewing, copying, or printing information; **Write**, which allows modifying data; **Execute**, which allows running specified programs; **Delete**, which allows removing system resources; **Create**, which allows generating new files, records, or fields; and **Search**, which allows listing or searching directories."
"Define an ""Access Control Matrix"".",An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy. It is a conceptual model used to represent the access rights of subjects to objects.
Describe the two dimensions of an Access Control Matrix.,"An Access Control Matrix has two main dimensions: one dimension consists of identified **subjects** that may attempt to access resources, and the other dimension lists the **objects** that may be accessed."
What does each entry in an Access Control Matrix indicate?,Each entry in an Access Control Matrix indicates the specific access rights of a particular subject for a particular object.
"Based on the example, what are the access rights for User A on File 1?","Based on the example, User A has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access rights for File 1."
"Based on the example, what are the access rights for User B on File 3?","Based on the example, User B has **Write** access rights for File 3."
"Based on the example, what are the access rights for User C on File 4?","Based on the example, User C has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access rights for File 4."
Explain the general structure of an Access Control Matrix.,"The general structure of an **Access Control Matrix** involves subjects listed along one dimension (typically rows) and objects listed along the other dimension (typically columns). The cells at the intersection of a subject and an object contain the specific access rights (e.g., Read, Write, Execute) that the subject possesses for that object."
List the possible operations for updating an Access Control Matrix.,"The possible operations for updating an Access Control Matrix include: Create subject `s`, Create object `o`, Grant permission `r` for subject `s` over object `o`, Revoke permission `r` for subject `s` over object `o`, Destroy subject `s`, and Destroy object `o`."
"How is a new subject `s` created in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this action?","To create a new subject `s`, a new row `s` is added to the Access Control Matrix. This operation is typically done by the system administrator."
"How is a new object `o` created in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this action?","To create a new object `o`, a new column `o` is added to the Access Control Matrix. This operation is typically done by the system administrator."
"Explain how to grant permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o` in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this.","To grant permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o`, the permission `r` is entered into the entry `M_s,o` of the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically done by the resource owner or the system administrator."
"Explain how to revoke permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o` in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this.","To revoke permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o`, the permission `r` is deleted from the entry `M_s,o` of the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically done by the resource owner or the system administrator."
"How is a subject `s` destroyed in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this action?","To destroy a subject `s`, the corresponding row `s` is deleted from the Access Control Matrix. This operation is typically done by the system administrator."
"How is an object `o` destroyed in an Access Control Matrix, and who typically performs this action?","To destroy an object `o`, the corresponding column `o` is deleted from the Access Control Matrix. This operation is typically done by the system administrator."
How is an access control matrix implemented in practice when it is sparse?,"In practice, an access control matrix, which is usually sparse, can be implemented by decomposition in one of two ways: by columns, leading to an **Access Control List (ACL)**, or by rows, leading to a **Capability List (C-List)**."
"Define an ""Access Control List (ACL)"".","An **Access Control List (ACL)** is an implementation of an access control matrix achieved through decomposition by columns. For each object, an ACL lists the users and their permitted access rights to that specific object."
"Explain the concept of ""Decomposition by columns"" in the context of access control matrix implementation.","**Decomposition by columns** is a method of implementing an access control matrix, particularly when it is sparse. In this approach, for each object, an Access Control List (ACL) is created that explicitly lists all the subjects (users) and their corresponding permitted access rights to that particular object."
What is the primary convenience of using an Access Control List (ACL)?,The primary convenience of using an **Access Control List (ACL)** is that it is effective when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource (object). It provides a clear list of permissions associated with each object.
"Based on the example, what are the access rights listed in the ACL for File 1?","Based on the example, the ACL for File 1 lists the following access rights: User A has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access; User B has **Read** access; and User C has **Read** and **Write** access."
"Based on the example, what are the access rights listed in the ACL for File 2?","Based on the example, the ACL for File 2 lists the following access rights: User B has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access; and User C has **Read** access."
"Based on the example, what are the access rights listed in the ACL for File 3?","Based on the example, the ACL for File 3 lists the following access rights: User A has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access; and User B has **Write** access."
"Based on the example, what are the access rights listed in the ACL for File 4?","Based on the example, the ACL for File 4 lists the following access rights: User B has **Read** access; and User C has **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** access."
"Define a ""Capability List (C-List)"".","A **Capability List (C-List)** is an implementation of an access control matrix achieved through decomposition by rows. For each subject (user), a C-list specifies the authorized objects and the operations that the user can perform on them."
"Explain the concept of ""Decomposition by rows"" in the context of access control matrix implementation.","**Decomposition by rows** is a method of implementing an access control matrix, particularly when it is sparse. In this approach, for each subject (user), a Capability List (C-List) is created that specifies all the authorized objects and the operations that the particular user can perform on those objects."
What is the primary convenience of using a Capability List (C-List)?,The primary convenience of using a **Capability List (C-List)** is that it is effective when determining the access rights available to a specific user (subject). It provides a clear list of what a user can do across various objects.
"Based on the example, what objects and operations are specified in the C-List for User A?","Based on the example, the C-List for User A specifies access to File 1 with **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** operations, and access to File 3 with **Read** and **Write** operations."
"Based on the example, what objects and operations are specified in the C-List for User B?","Based on the example, the C-List for User B specifies access to File 1 with **Read** operation, access to File 2 with **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** operations, access to File 3 with **Write** operation, and access to File 4 with **Read** operation."
"Based on the example, what objects and operations are specified in the C-List for User C?","Based on the example, the C-List for User C specifies access to File 1 with **Read** and **Write** operations, access to File 2 with **Read** operation, and access to File 4 with **Read**, **Write**, and **Execute** operations."
"How are various system components like files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices treated in Unix OS resource management?","In Unix OS resource management, files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as **resources**. These resources are considered the objects of access control."
Who owns each resource in Unix OS resource management?,"In Unix OS resource management, each resource has a single **user owner** and a **group owner**."
Describe the different file types indicated in the Unix OS resource management example.,The Unix OS resource management example indicates the following file types: `'-'` represents a regular **file**; `'d'` represents a **directory**; `'s'` represents a **socket**; `'b'` represents a **block device file**; `'l'` represents a **symbolic link**; and `'c'` represents a **character device file**.
"What information is typically associated with a resource in Unix OS, as shown in the example?","In Unix OS, a resource typically has associated information including: **File type** (e.g., file, directory), **File permissions** (Read/write/execute), **Link counter** (the number of directory entries pointing to the file), **Username** (the owner), **Group name** (the group owner), **File size**, and **Modified date/time**."
