"Define the concept of a ""subject"" in the context of access control and list its three primary types.","A subject is an entity typically held accountable for the actions it has initiated. There are three primary types of subjects: Owner, Group, and Other. An \""Owner\"" may be the creator of a resource, or for system resources, ownership may belong to a system administrator. A \""Group\"" refers to a collection of users to whom privileges can be assigned; users joining a group automatically gain its corresponding privileges, while users leaving a group lose them. A user may belong to multiple groups, and this concept simplifies permission management. \""Other\"" refers to users who can access the system but are not categorized as an owner or part of a group for a specific resource, and they are granted the least amount of access."
"Explain the role of an ""Owner"" subject and how it relates to resource management.","An \""Owner\"" is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource. In the context of system resources, ownership can also be assigned to a system administrator. The Owner is typically held accountable for actions initiated on the resource they own. A **subject** is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates, and a **resource** is an object to which access is controlled."
"Describe the functionality and benefits of assigning privileges to a ""Group"" subject.","Assigning privileges to a \""Group\"" allows for managing permissions for multiple users collectively, rather than individually. When a user joins a group, they automatically acquire the privileges corresponding to that group. Conversely, if a user quits a group, they lose those permissions. A user can be a member of multiple groups. The primary benefit of the group concept is that it makes it easier to manage and update permissions for a collection of users. A **Group** is a type of subject, which is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates."
"Differentiate between ""Owner,"" ""Group,"" and ""Other"" subjects based on their access levels and characteristics.","The three types of subjects are Owner, Group, and Other, each with distinct characteristics and access levels. An \""Owner\"" is typically the creator of a resource or a system administrator for system resources, holding primary accountability. A \""Group\"" is a collection of users to whom privileges are assigned; users automatically gain or lose privileges upon joining or leaving a group, simplifying management. \""Other\"" refers to users who can access the system but are not an owner or part of a group for a specific resource, and they are granted the least amount of access. A **subject** is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates."
"What happens to a user's privileges when they join or quit a ""Group""?","When a user joins a \""Group,\"" they will automatically have the corresponding privileges assigned to that group. Conversely, when a user quits the group, they will lose the corresponding permissions. A **Group** is a type of subject, which is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates."
"Define ""Other"" as a type of subject and explain its typical access level.","\""Other\"" is a type of subject that refers to users who are able to access the system but are not included in the categories of owner and group for a specific resource. These users are granted the least amount of access compared to owners or group members. A **subject** is an entity typically held accountable for the actions they have initiated."
"How does the concept of ""Group"" subjects simplify permission management?","The concept of Group subjects simplifies permission management by allowing privileges to be assigned to a collection of users rather than to individual users. This means that when permissions need to be updated, they can be changed once for the group, and all members of that group will automatically inherit the changes. This makes it easier to manage and update permissions, especially in systems with many users. A **Group** is a type of subject, which is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates."
"Define what an ""object"" is in the context of access control and provide examples.","An object is defined as a resource to which access is controlled. It is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. Examples of objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, applications (Apps), memory, hard disks, printers, and databases."
"List various examples of ""objects"" that can be subject to access control.","Various examples of objects that can be subject to access control include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, applications (Apps), memory, hard disks, printers, and databases. An **object** is a resource to which access is controlled, serving as an entity to contain and/or receive information."
"Explain the relationship between an ""object"" and information.","An object is fundamentally an entity used to contain and/or receive information. This means that objects are the containers or recipients of data within a system, and access control mechanisms are applied to these objects to regulate who can interact with that information. An **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"Provide examples of both physical and logical ""objects"" that might be found in computer systems.","Examples of physical objects in computer systems include memory, hard disks, and printers. Examples of logical objects include records, blocks, pages, segments, files, portions of files, directories, directory trees, mailboxes, messages, programs, network sockets, applications (Apps), and databases. An **object** is a resource to which access is controlled, serving as an entity to contain and/or receive information."
"What is the primary characteristic that defines an ""object"" in an access control system?",The primary characteristic that defines an object in an access control system is that it is a resource to which access is controlled. This means that mechanisms are in place to regulate which subjects can interact with it and in what ways. An **object** is also an entity used to contain and/or receive information.
"How do ""files"" and ""directories"" function as ""objects"" in a computer system?","Files and directories function as objects because they are resources to which access is controlled and they contain or receive information. Files store specific data, while directories organize files and other directories. Access control mechanisms determine which subjects can perform operations like reading, writing, or executing files, or listing/searching directories. An **object** is an entity used to contain and/or receive information."
"Identify the types of ""objects"" that are typically managed by a ""Computer System.""","A Computer System typically manages various types of objects, including applications (Apps), network sockets, memory, hard disks, printers, and databases. These are all resources to which access is controlled and are entities used to contain and/or receive information. An **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"Define ""operation"" in the context of access control and list the six standard types.","An operation describes the way in which a subject may access an object. The six standard types of operations are Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Create, and Search. A **subject** is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates, and an **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"Explain the ""Read"" operation and its associated capabilities.","The \""Read\"" operation allows a user to view information in a system resource. This can include viewing an entire file, selected records within a file, or selected fields within a record, or some combination thereof. Read access also includes the ability to copy or print the information. An **operation** describes how a subject accesses an object."
"Describe the ""Write"" and ""Execute"" operations, highlighting their distinct functions.","The \""Write\"" operation allows a user to modify data within a system resource, such as files, records, or programs. The \""Execute\"" operation, on the other hand, permits a user to run specified programs. While Write changes data, Execute runs code. An **operation** describes how a subject accesses an object."
"What are the functions of the ""Delete"" and ""Create"" operations?","The \""Delete\"" operation allows a user to remove certain system resources, such as files or records. The \""Create\"" operation enables a user to bring new files, records, or fields into existence. Both operations involve altering the presence of objects within the system. An **operation** describes how a subject accesses an object."
"Explain the ""Search"" operation and its purpose.","The \""Search\"" operation allows a user to list the files within a directory or otherwise search the directory. Its purpose is to enable subjects to discover or locate specific objects within a directory structure. An **operation** describes how a subject accesses an object."
"If a user has ""Read"" access to a file, what specific actions are they permitted to perform?","If a user has \""Read\"" access to a file, they are permitted to view the information contained within that file. This includes the ability to copy the file's contents or print them. The **Read operation** describes the way a subject may access an object to view its information."
"Differentiate between ""Read"" and ""Write"" operations in terms of data interaction.","The \""Read\"" operation allows a user to view information in a system resource, including the ability to copy or print it, without altering the resource's content. In contrast, the \""Write\"" operation allows a user to modify data in the system resource, such as files, records, or programs, thereby changing its content. An **operation** describes the way a subject may access an object."
"Define an ""Access Control Matrix"" and explain its fundamental structure.","An \""Access Control Matrix\"" is a popular implementation of an access control policy. Its fundamental structure consists of two dimensions: one dimension lists identified subjects that may attempt to access resources, and the other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed. Each entry within the matrix indicates the specific access rights a particular subject has for a particular object. A **subject** is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates, and an **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"How does an ""Access Control Matrix"" represent access rights?","An \""Access Control Matrix\"" represents access rights by having each entry in the matrix indicate the specific access rights of a particular subject for a particular object. Subjects are listed along one dimension (e.g., rows), and objects are listed along the other dimension (e.g., columns). The intersection of a subject and an object cell then contains the operations (e.g., Read, Write, Execute) that the subject is permitted to perform on that object. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"Identify the two dimensions of an ""Access Control Matrix.""","The two dimensions of an \""Access Control Matrix\"" are identified subjects that may attempt to access resources, and objects that may be accessed. Subjects typically form one axis (e.g., rows), and objects form the other axis (e.g., columns). An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"Based on the provided example, what access rights does ""User A"" have for ""File 1"" and ""File 3""?","Based on the provided example, User A has \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights for File 1. For File 3, User A also has \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy where entries indicate access rights of a subject for an object."
"Based on the provided example, what access rights does ""User B"" have for ""File 2"" and ""File 4""?","Based on the provided example, User B has \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights for File 2. For File 4, User B has \""Read\"" access rights. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy where entries indicate access rights of a subject for an object."
"Based on the provided example, which files can ""User C"" ""Read""?","Based on the provided example, User C can \""Read\"" File 1, File 2, and File 4. User C also has \""Write\"" access for File 1 and \""Execute\"" access for File 4. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy where entries indicate access rights of a subject for an object."
"Explain the purpose of an ""Access Control Matrix"" in implementing access control policy.","The purpose of an \""Access Control Matrix\"" is to provide a structured and explicit representation of an access control policy. It clearly defines, for every identified subject and every accessible object, the specific operations or access rights that the subject is permitted to perform on that object. This systematic organization allows for precise enforcement and management of security permissions within a system. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"Describe the process of ""Creating a subject"" and ""Creating an object"" in an Access Control Matrix.","Creating a subject `s` involves adding a new row `s` to the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator. Creating an object `o` involves adding a new column `o` to the Access Control Matrix, which is also typically done by the system administrator. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy. A **subject** is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates, and an **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"Explain how permissions are ""Granted"" and ""Revoked"" for a subject over an object in an Access Control Matrix.","Granting permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o` involves entering the permission `r` into the entry `M_s,o` of the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically performed by the resource owner or a system administrator. Revoking permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o` involves deleting the permission `r` from the entry `M_s,o` of the Access Control Matrix. This is also typically done by the resource owner or a system administrator. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"Who is typically responsible for updating an Access Control Matrix, specifically for granting and revoking permissions?","The resource owner or a system administrator is typically responsible for updating an Access Control Matrix, specifically for granting permission `r` for a subject `s` over an object `o` (by entering `r` into `M_s,o`) and for revoking permission `r` (by deleting `r` from `M_s,o`). The system administrator is also typically responsible for creating and destroying subjects and objects. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"Describe the actions involved in ""Destroying a subject"" and ""Destroying an object"" in an Access Control Matrix.","Destroying a subject `s` involves deleting the entire row `s` from the Access Control Matrix. This action is typically performed by the system administrator. Destroying an object `o` involves deleting the entire column `o` from the Access Control Matrix, which is also typically done by the system administrator. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
List the six possible changes that can be made to an Access Control Matrix.,"The six possible changes that can be made to an Access Control Matrix are:\n1.  **Create subject s:** Add a new row `s`.\n2.  **Create object o:** Create a new column `o`.\n3.  **Grant permission r for subject s over object o:** Enter `r` to entry `M_s,o`.\n4.  **Revoke permission r for subject s over object o:** Delete `r` from entry `M_s,o`.\n5.  **Destroy subject s:** Delete the row `s`.\n6.  **Destroy object o:** Delete the column `o`.\nThese changes are typically performed by a system administrator or resource owner. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
What is the role of the system administrator in updating an Access Control Matrix?,"The system administrator plays a crucial role in updating an Access Control Matrix. They are typically responsible for creating new subjects (adding rows) and objects (adding columns), as well as destroying existing subjects (deleting rows) and objects (deleting columns). Additionally, along with the resource owner, the system administrator can grant and revoke specific permissions for subjects over objects. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"How does the `M_s,o` notation relate to granting and revoking permissions in an Access Control Matrix?","The `M_s,o` notation refers to the specific entry in the Access Control Matrix that corresponds to subject `s` and object `o`. When granting permission `r` for subject `s` over object `o`, the permission `r` is entered into this `M_s,o` entry. Conversely, when revoking permission `r`, it is deleted from the `M_s,o` entry. This notation precisely identifies where permission changes are applied within the matrix. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy."
"Define an ""Access Control List (ACL)"" and explain how it relates to an Access Control Matrix.","An \""Access Control List (ACL)\"" is an implementation of an access control matrix, specifically achieved by decomposition by columns. In practice, an access control matrix is often sparse, meaning many entries are empty, and ACLs provide an efficient way to represent this. For each object, an ACL lists the users (subjects) and their permitted access rights for that particular object. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy, and an **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"What information does an ""Access Control List (ACL)"" contain for each object?","For each object, an \""Access Control List (ACL)\"" contains a list of users (subjects) and their permitted access rights. This means that for a given object, the ACL specifies which subjects can perform which operations (e.g., Read, Write, Execute) on it. An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a decomposition of an access control matrix by columns."
"Explain why an ""Access Control List (ACL)"" is considered convenient for certain access control determinations.","An \""Access Control List (ACL)\"" is considered convenient when determining which subjects have which access to a particular resource (object). Because an ACL is organized by object, it is straightforward to query an object's ACL to immediately see all subjects that have permissions on it and what those permissions are. This makes it efficient for answering questions like \""Who can access this file?\"" An **Access Control List (ACL)** is an implementation of an access control matrix by decomposition by columns."
"Based on the provided example, what access rights does ""User A"" have for ""File 1"" according to its ACL?","Based on the provided example, for File 1, User A has \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights according to its Access Control List (ACL). An **Access Control List (ACL)** lists users and their permitted access rights for each object."
"Based on the provided example, what access rights does ""User C"" have for ""File 2"" according to its ACL?","Based on the provided example, for File 2, User C has \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights according to its Access Control List (ACL). An **Access Control List (ACL)** lists users and their permitted access rights for each object."
"How does the decomposition by columns lead to an ""Access Control List (ACL)""?","Decomposition by columns means that for each column in the Access Control Matrix (which represents an object), a separate list is created. This list then contains all the subjects that have access to that specific object, along with the particular access rights they possess. This resulting list for each object is what constitutes an \""Access Control List (ACL)\"". An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy, and an **object** is a resource to which access is controlled."
"In what scenario is an ""Access Control List (ACL)"" particularly useful for managing permissions?","An \""Access Control List (ACL)\"" is particularly useful for managing permissions when the primary concern is to determine, for a given resource (object), which subjects have what specific access rights. Its object-centric organization makes it efficient for administrators or systems to quickly ascertain all permissions associated with a particular file, directory, or other resource. An **Access Control List (ACL)** is an implementation of an access control matrix by decomposition by columns."
"Define a ""Capability List (C-List)"" and explain how it relates to an Access Control Matrix.","A \""Capability List (C-List)\"" is an implementation of an access control matrix, specifically achieved by decomposition by rows. Similar to ACLs, C-Lists are used when an access control matrix is sparse. For each particular user (subject), a C-List specifies the authorized objects and the operations that user can perform on them. An **Access Control Matrix** is a popular implementation of an access control policy, and a **subject** is an entity held accountable for actions it initiates."
"What information does a ""Capability List (C-List)"" contain for each user?","For each particular user (subject), a \""Capability List (C-List)\"" specifies the authorized objects and the operations that user can perform on those objects. This means that for a given user, the C-List details all the resources they can access and the specific actions (e.g., Read, Write, Execute) they are permitted to take on each. A **Capability List (C-List)** is a decomposition of an access control matrix by rows."
"Explain why a ""Capability List (C-List)"" is considered convenient for certain access control determinations.","A \""Capability List (C-List)\"" is considered convenient when determining the access rights available to a specific user (subject). Because a C-List is organized by user, it is straightforward to query a user's C-List to immediately see all objects they have permissions on and what those permissions are. This makes it efficient for answering questions like \""What can this user do?\"" A **Capability List (C-List)** is an implementation of an access control matrix by decomposition by rows."
"Based on the provided example, what access rights does ""User A"" have according to their C-List?","Based on the provided example, User A's Capability List (C-List) indicates they have \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights for File 1, and \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights for File 3. A **Capability List (C-List)** specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user."
"Based on the provided example, what access rights does ""User B"" have according to their C-List?","Based on the provided example, User B's Capability List (C-List) indicates they have \""Read\"" access rights for File 1, \""Read,\"" \""Write,\"" and \""Execute\"" access rights for File 2, \""Write\"" access rights for File 3, and \""Read\"" access rights for File 4. A **Capability List (C-List)** specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular user."
"How does the decomposition by rows lead to a ""Capability List (C-List)""?","Decomposition by rows means that for each row in the Access Control Matrix (which represents a subject), a separate list is created.

Its user-centric organization makes it efficient for administrators or systems to quickly ascertain the full scope of a user's privileges across all objects. A **Capability List (C-List)** is an implementation of an access control matrix by decomposition by rows."
"Analyze how resources are managed in a Unix OS, specifically identifying what is treated as a resource and the ownership model.","In a \""Unix OS,\"" files, directories, memory devices, and I/O devices are uniformly treated as resources. These resources are considered the objects of access control. Each resource in a Unix OS has a single user owner and a single group owner. This ownership model dictates who has primary control and who shares access through group privileges. A **resource** is an object to which access is controlled, and an **object** is an entity used to contain and/or receive information. A **user owner** is a type of subject that may be the creator of a resource, and a **group owner** is a type of subject where privileges are assigned to a group of users."
