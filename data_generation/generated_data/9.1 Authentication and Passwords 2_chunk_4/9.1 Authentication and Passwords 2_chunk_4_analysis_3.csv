Analyse the primary purpose of password salting.,"Password salting primarily serves to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. A salt, which is a random string, is added to a password before applying the hash function. This process ensures that even if an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they cannot easily use pre-computed tables to reverse them."
Define what a 'salt' is in the context of password security.,"In the context of password security, a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. It is just a random string. Each password has its own salt, and this salt value is stored along with the hash of the password and salt combination."
Explain how salting impacts an attacker's ability to pre-compute hashes.,"Salting significantly impacts an attacker's ability to pre-compute hashes by requiring them to pre-compute a vastly larger number of hashes. For a salt of nbit, an attacker needs to pre-compute 2n of hashes for the same password. Since each password has its own unique salt, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Describe the storage mechanism for a salt in a password system.,"The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This means that when a password is hashed, the unique, randomly generated salt string is combined with the password, and then the combined string is hashed. Both the resulting hash and the original salt are then stored together."
What is the fundamental principle behind secure password storage?,"The fundamental principle behind secure password storage is to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. This involves using methods like hashing to transform the password into an irreversible format, making it impossible to retrieve the original plaintext password directly."
Explain the primary challenge defenders face against offline password attacks.,"The primary challenge defenders face against offline password attacks is that after an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force hashes offline. As a defender, it is only possible to slow down offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource intensive as possible, thereby increasing the time and computational power required for an attacker to crack the passwords."
Differentiate between hashing and encryption in the context of sensitive data storage.,"Hashing and encryption both provide ways to keep sensitive data safe, but they differ fundamentally in their reversibility. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. It is appropriate for password validation. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way function, meaning that the original plaintext password can be retrieved if the key is available."
Why should passwords be hashed rather than encrypted for storage?,"Passwords should be hashed, NOT encrypted, for storage because hashing is a one-way function. This means that once a password has been hashed, it is impossible to ""decrypt"" the hash to obtain the original plaintext value. This provides a higher level of security, as even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot retrieve the actual password to log in as the victim. Encryption, being a two-way function, would allow the original plaintext password to be retrieved if the attacker also obtained the encryption key."
Describe the basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes.,"The basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes involve: first, selecting a password they think the victim has chosen (e.g., ""password1!""); second, calculating the hash of that selected password; and third, comparing the calculated hash to the hash of the victim. If the two hashes match, the attacker has successfully ""cracked"" the hash and now knows the plaintext value of the victim's password."
What methods do attackers use to select candidate passwords for cracking?,"Attackers use several methods to select candidate passwords for cracking. These include using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, employing brute force techniques (trying every possible candidate), and utilizing dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords. This process is repeated for a large number of potential candidate passwords."
"Discuss the cost implications for an attacker attempting to crack passwords, considering modern hardware.","While the number of permutations can be enormous, the cost to an attacker to do successful password cracking is relatively small, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed. This is due to the availability of high-speed hardware such as GPUs and cloud services with many servers for rent, which provide immense computational power."
How do strong passwords combined with modern hashing algorithms deter attackers?,"Strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack. Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, automatically salt passwords and are designed to be resource-intensive, which significantly increases the computational effort required for cracking, making brute-force attacks impractical."
Explain the role of an administrator in ensuring password security.,"The role of an administrator in ensuring password security is critical, as it is their responsibility to select a modern hashing algorithm. By choosing and implementing robust, modern hashing algorithms and adhering to best practices, administrators can ensure that passwords are stored securely, making them effectively impossible for attackers to crack, even with advanced hardware."
How does salting protect against rainbow tables?,"Salting protects against rainbow tables by ensuring that each password, even if identical, produces a unique hash due to the addition of a unique, randomly generated salt. Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables of hashes for common passwords. Since salting means that the same password will result in a different hash for each user (because of different salts), an attacker cannot use a single rainbow table lookup to crack multiple passwords. Instead, they would need to generate a new rainbow table for each unique salt, which is computationally infeasible."
What is the implication of salting on determining if two users have the same password?,"The implication of salting on determining if two users have the same password is that it is impossible to determine this without cracking the hashes. This is because the different salts applied to each password will result in different hashes, even if the underlying plaintext passwords are identical. An attacker cannot simply compare two stored hashes to see if they match, as the unique salts will ensure they are distinct."
List examples of modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Examples of modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords include Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed to incorporate salting as an inherent part of their hashing process, eliminating the need for additional steps to manage and apply salts manually when using them."
Describe the process flow of password salting as illustrated.,"As illustrated, the process flow of password salting begins with the plaintext password, for example, ""hello"". A unique, randomly generated ""salt"" is then added to this password, resulting in a combined string like ""hello3ab9"". This combined string (password + salt) is then fed into a hash function, which produces a cryptographic hash, such as ""39e19b234..."". Finally, both the generated hash and the original salt are stored together."
What is the primary goal of storing passwords securely?,"The primary goal of storing passwords securely is to prevent them from being obtained by an attacker, even in scenarios where the application or database itself has been compromised. This ensures that user accounts remain protected even if a breach occurs, as the original plaintext passwords cannot be directly accessed or easily reconstructed."
"Explain why hashing is considered a ""one-way function.""","Hashing is considered a ""one-way function"" because it is computationally impossible to reverse the process. Once a plaintext input (like a password) has been transformed into a hash value, it is impossible to ""decrypt"" that hash and obtain the original plaintext value. This irreversibility is a core security feature, as it prevents attackers from directly recovering passwords even if they gain access to the stored hashes."
How does an attacker's ability to brute force hashes offline impact password security strategies?,"An attacker's ability to brute force hashes offline significantly impacts password security strategies by highlighting the need for resource-intensive hashing algorithms. Since attackers can continuously try password combinations without needing to interact with the live system, defenders must choose algorithms that make each individual hash calculation as slow and computationally expensive as possible. This strategy aims to slow down offline attacks, making them less practical and more costly for the attacker."
"What is the significance of a salt being a ""random string""?","The significance of a salt being a ""random string"" lies in its unpredictability and uniqueness. A random string ensures that the salt cannot be easily guessed or pre-computed by an attacker. When combined with a password, this randomness contributes to a unique hash for each password, even if the passwords themselves are identical, thereby enhancing security against various attack methods like rainbow tables."
How does the uniqueness of a salt for each password enhance security?,"The uniqueness of a salt for each password significantly enhances security by forcing attackers to process each hash individually. Since each password has its own distinct salt, an attacker cannot compute a single hash for a common password (e.g., ""password123"") and compare it against all stored hashes. Instead, they must apply the specific salt for each user's password before hashing and then compare, making the cracking of large numbers of hashes much more time-consuming and resource-intensive."
What happens if an attacker obtains a hashed password but not the original plaintext?,"If an attacker obtains a hashed password but not the original plaintext, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim. This is because applications expect the plaintext password, which they then hash and compare to the stored hash. The attacker would still need to ""crack"" the hash to discover the original plaintext password before they could attempt to log in."
In what circumstances is hashing appropriate for password validation?,"Hashing is appropriate for password validation because it allows for verification of a password without ever storing or handling the plaintext version. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is hashed, and this newly computed hash is compared against the stored hash. If they match, the password is valid. This process ensures that even if the stored hashes are compromised, the original passwords remain unknown."
"What are ""pre-computed hashes"" and how does salting mitigate their threat?","""Pre-computed hashes"" are tables or databases of hash values for a vast number of common or potential passwords, often generated in advance by attackers (e.g., rainbow tables). Salting mitigates their threat by adding a unique, random string (the salt) to each password before hashing. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to their unique salts, rendering pre-computed hash tables ineffective for cracking multiple passwords simultaneously."
How does the resource intensiveness of hash algorithms contribute to password security?,"The resource intensiveness of hash algorithms contributes to password security by slowing down offline attacks. By selecting algorithms that require significant computational power and time for each hash calculation, defenders make it more expensive and time-consuming for attackers to brute force hashes. This increased cost and time requirement can deter attackers or make large-scale cracking impractical."
What is the primary difference in functionality between hashing and encryption?,"The primary difference in functionality between hashing and encryption is that hashing is a one-way function, meaning it's irreversible, while encryption is a two-way function, meaning it's reversible with the correct key. Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string that cannot be converted back to the original, whereas encryption transforms data into an unreadable format that can be converted back to its original plaintext form using a decryption key."
"Explain the concept of ""brute force"" in the context of password cracking.","In the context of password cracking, ""brute force"" refers to an attack method where an attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters, numbers, and symbols until they find the correct password. This process can be extremely time-consuming but is guaranteed to eventually find the password if given enough time and computational resources. Attackers often use this method against acquired password hashes offline."
Why is it important for administrators to select modern hashing algorithms?,"It is important for administrators to select modern hashing algorithms because these algorithms are designed with current security best practices in mind, including automatic salting and being resource-intensive. Modern algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 make it significantly harder for attackers to crack passwords, even with high-speed hardware, thereby providing a much stronger defense against password compromise."
How does salting prevent database-based lookups for cracking passwords?,"Salting prevents database-based lookups for cracking passwords by ensuring that each password, even if identical, results in a unique hash due to the unique salt applied to it. If an attacker compromises a database and obtains hashes, they cannot simply perform a lookup in a pre-computed database of common password hashes, because the added salt changes the hash value. Each unique salt requires a separate computation, rendering large-scale database lookups ineffective."
What is the consequence if best practices for hashing are not followed?,"If best practices for hashing are not followed, the consequence is that the cost for an attacker to successfully crack passwords becomes relatively small. This means that even with high-speed hardware like GPUs and readily available cloud services, attackers can more easily and affordably crack passwords, significantly increasing the risk of account compromise and data breaches."
Can an attacker use a hashed password to log in as a victim? Explain why or why not.,"No, an attacker cannot use a hashed password to log in as a victim. This is because an application's login system expects the original plaintext password. When a user enters their password, the application hashes it and then compares this newly computed hash to the stored hash. If an attacker only has the stored hash, they cannot provide the plaintext password that the system needs to perform its own hashing and comparison."
What is the role of a hash function in the salting process?,"In the salting process, the hash function's role is to take the combined string of the password and its unique salt, and then transform it into a fixed-size, irreversible cryptographic hash value. This hash function ensures that the original password and salt cannot be retrieved from the resulting hash, providing a secure representation of the password for storage and validation."
How does the time required for cracking hashes change when salting is implemented?,"When salting is implemented, the time required for cracking hashes significantly increases. Because the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
"What are the security benefits of using modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2?","The security benefits of using modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 are primarily that they automatically salt passwords and are designed to be resource-intensive. Automatic salting protects against pre-computed hashes and makes it impossible to determine if two users have the same password. Their resource-intensive nature significantly slows down brute-force attacks, making password cracking effectively impossible for attackers when combined with strong passwords and best practices."
Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained even if the database is compromised?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained even if the database is compromised because database breaches are a common occurrence. If plaintext passwords were stored, a compromise would immediately expose all user credentials. By storing only irreversible hashes (preferably salted and resource-intensive), even a compromised database does not directly yield usable passwords, thus protecting user accounts."
"Describe the concept of ""offline attacks"" in password cracking.","""Offline attacks"" in password cracking refer to scenarios where an attacker has obtained a copy of the stored password hashes (e.g., from a compromised database) and attempts to crack them on their own systems, without needing to interact with the live application or server. This allows them to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks at their own pace, often using powerful hardware, without triggering any rate limits or detection mechanisms of the target system."
What is the primary defense mechanism against an attacker's ability to brute force hashes offline?,"The primary defense mechanism against an attacker's ability to brute force hashes offline is to select hash algorithms that are as resource intensive as possible. This makes each individual hash calculation computationally expensive, thereby significantly slowing down the attacker's brute-force attempts and increasing the time and cost required to crack passwords."
How does salting contribute to the overall security posture of a password storage system?,"Salting contributes to the overall security posture of a password storage system by significantly increasing the difficulty and cost for attackers to crack passwords. It achieves this by reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, protecting against rainbow tables and database-based lookups, and making it impossible to determine if two users have the same password. This is because each password receives a unique, random salt, forcing attackers to crack hashes individually."
"What is the difference between a ""dictionary attack"" and a ""brute force attack"" in password cracking?","A ""dictionary attack"" involves an attacker trying a list of common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords (a dictionary or wordlist) as candidate passwords. In contrast, a ""brute force attack"" is more exhaustive, systematically trying every possible combination of characters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found. While a dictionary attack is faster if the password is common, a brute force attack is guaranteed to find any password given enough time."
"Explain why ""decrypting"" a password hash is impossible.","""Decrypting"" a password hash is impossible because hashing is a one-way function. Unlike encryption, which is designed to be reversible with a key, hashing algorithms are specifically designed to produce a fixed-size output that cannot be mathematically inverted to recover the original input (the plaintext password). Any attempt to ""decrypt"" a hash is actually an attempt to ""crack"" it by finding an input that produces the same hash, not by reversing the hash function itself."
How does the use of GPUs and cloud services affect password cracking efforts?,"The use of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and cloud services significantly enhances password cracking efforts by providing attackers with immense computational power at a relatively low cost. GPUs are highly efficient at parallel processing, making them ideal for rapidly calculating millions or billions of hashes. Cloud services offer scalable, on-demand computing resources, allowing attackers to rent powerful servers for short periods to accelerate cracking, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed."
"What is the purpose of the ""store hash and salt"" step in the password salting illustration?","The purpose of the ""store hash and salt"" step in the password salting illustration is to securely preserve both the computed hash of the password+salt combination and the unique salt itself. Storing the salt alongside the hash is crucial because the salt is needed during future authentication attempts to re-hash the user's entered password for comparison with the stored hash. This ensures that the salting mechanism remains effective for validation."
"Why is it important that a salt is ""unique for every user""?","It is important that a salt is ""unique for every user"" because this prevents attackers from using pre-computed hashes or rainbow tables to crack multiple passwords simultaneously. If the same salt were used for all users, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords with that single salt and then quickly find matches across many user accounts. A unique salt for each user forces the attacker to crack each password hash individually, dramatically increasing the time and resources required."
What is the primary security advantage of hashing over encryption for password storage?,"The primary security advantage of hashing over encryption for password storage is its one-way nature. Hashing makes it impossible to retrieve the original plaintext password, even if the stored hash is compromised. In contrast, if an encrypted password store is compromised and the encryption key is also obtained, all original plaintext passwords could be recovered, leading to a complete compromise of user accounts."
How do modern hashing algorithms simplify the salting process for administrators?,"Modern hashing algorithms simplify the salting process for administrators by automatically incorporating salting into their design. Algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 handle the generation and application of unique salts internally, meaning no additional steps are required from the administrator to manage or apply salts manually when using these algorithms."
"What are the consequences of an attacker obtaining passwords from ""other compromised sites""?","The consequences of an attacker obtaining passwords from ""other compromised sites"" are significant because users often reuse passwords across multiple services. If an attacker acquires a list of usernames and passwords from one compromised site, they can then attempt to use these credentials (known as credential stuffing) to gain unauthorized access to accounts on other services, even if those other services were not directly breached."
Explain how salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder.,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. Since each password has a unique salt, an attacker cannot compute a single hash for a candidate password and compare it against all stored hashes. Instead, for each stored hash, the attacker must combine their candidate password with the specific salt associated with that hash, then compute a new hash, and finally compare it. This forces individual cracking attempts for each user, multiplying the computational effort."
"What is the role of ""resource-intensive"" hash algorithms in slowing down offline attacks?","The role of ""resource-intensive"" hash algorithms in slowing down offline attacks is to make each individual hashing operation computationally expensive in terms of CPU cycles, memory, or both. By requiring more resources per hash calculation, these algorithms increase the time it takes for an attacker to test a large number of candidate passwords, thereby making brute-force and dictionary attacks less efficient and more costly, ultimately slowing down the cracking process."
Summarize the key benefits of implementing password salting.,"Implementing password salting offers several key benefits: it significantly reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks by making pre-computed hashes (like rainbow tables) useless; it protects against database-based lookups; it makes it impossible to determine if two users have the same password, even if their plaintext passwords are identical, because different salts yield different hashes; and it dramatically increases the time and computational resources an attacker needs to crack a large number of hashes by forcing individual cracking attempts for each unique salt."
