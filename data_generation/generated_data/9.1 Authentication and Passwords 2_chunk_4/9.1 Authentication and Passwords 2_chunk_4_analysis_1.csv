Explain the primary purpose of password salting in the context of reducing offline attacks.,"Password salting's primary purpose is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. A salt, which is a random string, is added to a password before applying the hash function. This process ensures that for a salt of n-bit, an attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password, significantly increasing the computational effort required for cracking."
Describe what a salt is and its characteristics in the password salting process.,A salt is a random string that is added to a password before the hash function is applied. A key characteristic is that each password has its own unique salt. The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password combined with the salt.
Illustrate the basic steps involved in the password salting process as depicted.,"The basic steps in the password salting process involve taking a plaintext password, adding a salt to it, then applying a hash function to the combined password and salt. The resulting hash, along with the salt, is then stored."
How does the use of an n-bit salt impact an attacker's effort to pre-compute hashes for a password?,"For a salt of n-bit, an attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n of hashes for the same password. This exponentially increases the computational resources and time required for an attacker to generate pre-computed hashes, thereby reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks."
What is the storage requirement for the salt value in a password salting system?,"The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This ensures that when a password needs to be verified, the correct salt can be retrieved and combined with the entered password before hashing for comparison."
Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker?,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. This is because if an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline."
What is the primary challenge for defenders in preventing offline password attacks?,"The primary challenge for defenders in preventing offline password attacks is that it is only possible to slow down these attacks. This is achieved by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource intensive as possible, making the brute-force process more time-consuming and costly for attackers."
What actions can an attacker take after acquiring stored password hashes?,"After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. Brute force refers to systematically trying every possible candidate password until the correct one is found. This means they can attempt to guess the original passwords without needing to interact with the compromised system, using their own computational resources."
Compare and contrast hashing and encryption in terms of their primary function for sensitive data.,"Hashing and encryption both provide ways to keep sensitive data safe. However, hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. In contrast, encryption is a two-way function, meaning the original plaintext password can be retrieved if the key is available."
Explain why passwords should be hashed and not encrypted.,"Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted, because hashing is a one-way function. A one-way function is irreversible, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. If passwords were encrypted, which is a two-way function, an attacker with the encryption key could decrypt them and gain access to the original passwords."
Define hashing and explain its appropriateness for password validation.,"Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. Hashing is appropriate for password validation because it allows the system to verify an entered password by hashing it and comparing the result to the stored hash, without ever needing to store or know the original plaintext password."
What is the implication if an attacker obtains a hashed password regarding logging in as the victim?,"Even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim. This is because the application expects a plaintext password to hash and compare, not a pre-hashed value. The attacker would still need to crack the hash to find the original plaintext password."
Define encryption and its key characteristic.,"Encryption is a two-way function, meaning that the original plaintext password can be retrieved if the key is available. This distinguishes it from hashing, which is a one-way process."
Can password hashes be decrypted to obtain original passwords? Explain.,"It is not possible to ""decrypt"" password hashes to obtain the original passwords because hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is irreversible. However, it is possible to ""crack"" the hashes in some circumstances by guessing potential passwords, hashing them, and comparing the results to the stored hashes."
Outline the basic steps an attacker follows to crack unsalted password hashes.,"The basic steps an attacker follows to crack unsalted password hashes are: first, select a password they think the victim has chosen; second, calculate the hash of that chosen password; and third, compare the calculated hash to the hash of the victim. If they match, the attacker has successfully ""cracked"" the hash and knows the plaintext password."
"Describe the general process attackers use to crack password hashes, including how candidate passwords are selected.","Attackers crack password hashes by repeating a process for a large number of potential candidate passwords. The methods used to select these candidate passwords include using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, employing brute force by trying every possible candidate, or utilizing dictionaries and wordlists of common passwords."
What are the different methods attackers use to select candidate passwords when attempting to crack hashes?,"Attackers use several methods to select candidate passwords when attempting to crack hashes. These include leveraging lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, performing a brute force attack which involves trying every possible candidate password, and using dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords."
"Analyze the cost implications for an attacker performing password cracking, considering hardware and services.","The cost to an attacker for successful password cracking is relatively small, even though the number of permutations can be enormous. This is due to the availability of high-speed hardware, such as GPUs, and cloud services with many servers for rent. This low cost is particularly true when best practices for hashing are not followed."
What makes strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms effectively impossible for an attacker to crack?,"Strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack. This is because modern algorithms, combined with best practices like salting and resource-intensive operations, significantly increase the computational effort and time required for an attacker to guess or brute-force the correct password."
What is the administrator's responsibility regarding hashing algorithms?,"It is the administrator's responsibility to select a modern hashing algorithm. This choice is crucial for ensuring that passwords are stored securely and are effectively impossible for attackers to crack, especially when combined with strong passwords and best practices."
Provide a comprehensive definition of salting in the context of password storage concepts.,"Salting is a password storage concept where a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, is added to each password as part of the hashing process. This unique salt for every user means an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This significantly increases the time required for cracking, as it grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
How does the uniqueness of a salt for every user impact an attacker's ability to crack multiple password hashes?,"As the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Explain how salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder.,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because each password has a unique, randomly generated salt. A salt is a random string added to a password before hashing. This forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the specific salt associated with each password, instead of pre-computing hashes for common passwords and comparing them against a database of stored hashes. Consequently, the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks impractical."
How does salting protect against rainbow tables and database-based lookups?,"Salting protects against rainbow tables and database-based lookups by ensuring that each password, even if identical, produces a different hash due to the unique salt added to it. A rainbow table relies on pre-computed hashes for common passwords, but with salting, the attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt, which is computationally infeasible. Similarly, database-based lookups for pre-computed hashes become ineffective."
Explain how salting prevents determining if two users have the same password.,"Salting prevents determining whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because different salts, which are unique random strings added to passwords before hashing, will result in different hashes even if the underlying plaintext passwords are identical. Therefore, an attacker cannot simply compare stored hashes to identify users with the same password."
List examples of modern hashing algorithms that automatically handle password salting.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This means that no additional steps are required from the administrator or developer to implement salting when using these algorithms, simplifying secure password storage."
"What is the benefit of using modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2?","The benefit of using modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 is that they automatically salt the passwords. Salting involves adding a unique, random string to each password before hashing. This eliminates the need for additional steps to implement salting, simplifying the process of securing passwords and ensuring that best practices are followed by default."
What is the overall goal of secure password storage?,"The overall goal of secure password storage is to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database itself is compromised. This is crucial because attackers can always brute force acquired password hashes offline."
Discuss the implications of an application or database being compromised if passwords are not stored securely.,"If an application or database is compromised and passwords are not stored securely, attackers can obtain stored password hashes. Once acquired, these hashes can be subjected to offline brute force attacks, potentially revealing the original plaintext passwords. This highlights the critical need for robust password storage mechanisms."
Why is it impossible to 'decrypt' a hash?,"It is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash because hashing is a one-way function. A one-way function is a mathematical operation that is easy to compute in one direction but extremely difficult or impossible to reverse. This means that the process of generating a hash from an input is irreversible; there is no mathematical operation that can reliably transform a hash back into its original plaintext value."
How does hashing contribute to password validation without compromising security?,"Hashing contributes to password validation without compromising security by allowing a system to verify a user's password without ever storing or knowing the plaintext password. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is hashed, and this new hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct, but the original password remains unknown and unrecoverable from the stored hash."
Describe the fundamental difference between a one-way function and a two-way function in cryptography.,"The fundamental difference between a one-way function and a two-way function in cryptography lies in their reversibility. A one-way function, like hashing, is irreversible, meaning it's impossible to obtain the original input from its output. A two-way function, like encryption, is reversible, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved from the ciphertext if the correct key is available."
What are the consequences if an attacker successfully cracks a password hash?,"If an attacker successfully cracks a password hash, they will know the plaintext value of the victim's password. This allows them to potentially log in as the victim to the application or service associated with that password, or use the password for credential stuffing attacks on other services if the victim reuses passwords."
What is meant by 'brute force' in the context of cracking password hashes?,"In the context of cracking password hashes, 'brute force' refers to a method where an attacker attempts every possible candidate password. This involves systematically trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct password that generates the matching hash is found."
How do compromised sites contribute to password cracking efforts?,"Compromised sites contribute to password cracking efforts by providing attackers with lists of passwords. These lists, often containing plaintext or hashed passwords from data breaches, can be used as candidate passwords in dictionary attacks or as a basis for generating more sophisticated guesses, significantly speeding up the cracking process for other systems."
Explain why selecting resource-intensive hash algorithms is a key defense strategy.,"Selecting resource-intensive hash algorithms is a key defense strategy because it significantly slows down offline attacks. Offline attacks occur when an attacker attempts to crack hashes using their own resources after acquiring them. Even with high-speed hardware, these algorithms require substantial computational power and time for each hashing operation, making brute-force attacks economically and practically infeasible for a large number of passwords, especially when best practices are followed."
How does salting specifically reduce the effectiveness of pre-computed hashes?,"Salting specifically reduces the effectiveness of pre-computed hashes by ensuring that a unique, random string (the salt) is added to each password before hashing. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to different salts. Consequently, pre-computed hash tables, such as rainbow tables, which rely on a fixed input-to-hash mapping, become useless as they would need to be re-computed for every unique salt, which is impractical."
What is the role of a modern hashing algorithm in ensuring password security?,"The role of a modern hashing algorithm in ensuring password security is multifaceted. Firstly, they are designed to be resource-intensive, slowing down brute-force attacks. Secondly, algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically incorporate salting, which is the addition of a unique random string to each password before hashing. This protects against pre-computed hashes and makes it impossible to determine if two users share the same password by simply comparing hashes, even if the plaintext passwords are identical."
Why is it important for an administrator to select a modern hashing algorithm?,"It is important for an administrator to select a modern hashing algorithm because these algorithms are designed to be robust against current cracking techniques. They incorporate best practices, such as automatic salting and being computationally intensive, which makes strong passwords effectively impossible for an attacker to crack, even with high-speed hardware."
What are the consequences of not following best practices for hashing when storing passwords?,"Not following best practices for hashing when storing passwords significantly increases the vulnerability to successful password cracking. Even with enormous permutations, the cost to an attacker becomes relatively small, especially with access to high-speed hardware like GPUs and cloud services. This makes it easier and faster for attackers to compromise user accounts."
Explain the concept of 'offline attacks' in password cracking.,"Offline attacks in password cracking refer to the process where an attacker, after acquiring stored password hashes from a compromised system, attempts to crack these hashes using their own computational resources without needing to interact further with the target system. This allows them to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks at their leisure, often at high speeds, without triggering alarms on the target system."
How does the 'add salt' step in the illustration contribute to the security of the password?,"The 'add salt' step in the illustration contributes to the security of the password by introducing a unique, random string, known as a salt, to the password before it is hashed. This ensures that even if the same password is used by multiple users, or if an attacker tries to pre-compute hashes, each password will produce a different hash, making it significantly harder to crack using methods like rainbow tables or by comparing pre-computed values."
What is the significance of storing the salt along with the hash of password+salt?,"Storing the salt along with the hash of password+salt is significant because it allows the system to correctly verify a user's password during login. When a user enters their password, the system retrieves the stored salt, combines it with the entered password, and then hashes the combination. This newly generated hash is then compared to the stored hash. Without the stored salt, the system would not be able to recreate the exact hash for comparison."
Why is it crucial for a salt to be a random string?,"It is crucial for a salt to be a random string because randomness ensures unpredictability. A salt is a unique string added to a password before hashing. If salts were predictable or sequential, an attacker could potentially anticipate them or generate them systematically, undermining the security benefits of salting. A random salt makes each hash unique and forces attackers to crack each password individually, significantly increasing their effort."
What are the implications of an attacker being able to brute force hashes offline?,"The implications of an attacker being able to brute force hashes offline are severe. It means that once an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they can dedicate unlimited computational resources and time to crack them without fear of detection from the target system. This makes it a persistent threat, emphasizing the need for robust hashing algorithms and salting to make the brute-force process as slow and costly as possible."
How does the concept of a 'one-way function' apply to password security?,"The concept of a 'one-way function' applies to password security by ensuring that passwords, once hashed, cannot be reversed to reveal their original plaintext form. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the stored hashes, they cannot directly obtain the actual passwords, thereby protecting user credentials from direct exposure."
"What specific types of attacks does salting protect against, beyond general offline attacks?","Beyond general offline attacks, salting specifically protects against attacks using rainbow tables and database-based lookups. These methods rely on pre-computed hashes, but salting ensures that each password generates a unique hash due to its unique salt, rendering such pre-computed tables ineffective and forcing attackers to crack each hash individually."
"How does salting contribute to the privacy of user passwords, even if they are the same?","Salting contributes to the privacy of user passwords by making it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because the different salts, which are unique random strings added to passwords before hashing, applied to identical passwords will result in distinct hash values. Therefore, an attacker cannot simply compare stored hashes to identify users who might be reusing the same password across different accounts."
What is the primary advantage of modern hashing algorithms automatically salting passwords?,"The primary advantage of modern hashing algorithms automatically salting passwords is that it simplifies the implementation of secure password storage. Administrators and developers do not need to perform additional steps to generate and manage salts, ensuring that this critical security measure is consistently applied by default when using algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2."
Summarize the key reasons why password salting is considered a best practice in password storage.,"Password salting is considered a best practice in password storage for several key reasons. It reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks by requiring attackers to pre-compute hashes for each unique salt, making large-scale cracking significantly harder. A salt is a unique, randomly generated string added to each password before hashing. It protects against rainbow tables and database-based lookups by ensuring unique hashes for even identical passwords. Furthermore, it prevents attackers from determining if two users share the same password, enhancing user privacy. Modern hashing algorithms also automate this process, simplifying secure implementation."
