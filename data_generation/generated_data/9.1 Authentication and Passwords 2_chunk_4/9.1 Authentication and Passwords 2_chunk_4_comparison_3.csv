Compare hashing with encryption in the context of sensitive data protection.,"Hashing and encryption both serve to keep sensitive data safe. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to \""decrypt\"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. It is appropriate for password validation, and even if an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot use it to log in as the victim. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way function, which means the original plaintext data can be retrieved if the correct key is available. A one-way function transforms data in such a way that it cannot be reversed, while a two-way function allows for reversal with a key."
What are the differences between hashing and encryption when storing passwords?,"When storing passwords, hashing is the recommended method, not encryption. Hashing is a one-way function, making it impossible to reverse the process and retrieve the original password from its hash. This is suitable for password validation. Encryption, conversely, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext password to be retrieved if the key is known. Therefore, passwords should be hashed to prevent their retrieval even if the storage is compromised. A plaintext password is the original, unencrypted, or unhashed form of a password."
Compare the security implications of storing unsalted password hashes versus salted password hashes.,"Storing unsalted password hashes makes them vulnerable to offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, where an attacker can calculate a hash once and compare it against many stored hashes. An offline attack is one where an attacker has acquired stored password hashes and attempts to crack them without interacting with the live system. In contrast, storing salted password hashes significantly reduces the effectiveness of such attacks. A salt, which is a unique, randomly generated string added to each password before hashing, requires an attacker to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, and also protects against rainbow tables and database-based lookups. A rainbow table is a pre-computed table of hashes for common passwords."
What are the differences in an attacker's effort when cracking unsalted password hashes compared to salted password hashes?,"When cracking unsalted password hashes, an attacker can pre-compute hashes for common passwords or use rainbow tables, then compare these pre-computed hashes against all stored hashes. Pre-computed hashes are hash values calculated in advance. This is efficient as a single pre-computation can potentially crack many passwords. For salted password hashes, however, the attacker's effort increases dramatically. Since each password has its own unique salt, the attacker must add the specific salt to each guessed password, apply the hash function, and then compare it to the target hash. This means the attacker cannot pre-compute hashes for general use and must perform a unique computation for each password attempt against each target hash, making the process much more resource-intensive and time-consuming. A hash function is an algorithm that transforms an input (like a password+salt) into a fixed-size string of characters (the hash)."
Compare the impact of a compromised database containing unsalted password hashes versus one containing salted password hashes.,"If a database containing unsalted password hashes is compromised, an attacker can acquire these hashes and attempt to crack them offline using methods like pre-computed hashes or rainbow tables. This allows for efficient cracking of many passwords simultaneously. If a database containing salted password hashes is compromised, the attacker still acquires the hashes (which include the salt) and the salts themselves. However, because each password has a unique salt, the attacker cannot use pre-computed tables or crack multiple passwords with a single hash calculation. Instead, they must perform a separate cracking attempt for each individual password, significantly increasing the time and computational resources required to compromise multiple accounts. Cracking a hash involves guessing potential plaintext passwords, calculating their hashes, and comparing them to the target hash to find a match."
What is the difference between how an attacker uses pre-computed hashes against unsalted passwords versus salted passwords?,"Against unsalted passwords, an attacker can use pre-computed hashes, such as those found in rainbow tables, to quickly find matches for many stored hashes. A pre-computed hash for a common password can be compared against all unsalted hashes in a compromised database. Against salted passwords, pre-computed hashes are largely ineffective. Since a unique, randomly generated salt is added to each password before hashing, the hash for 'password' with 'salt1' will be different from 'password' with 'salt2'. This means an attacker cannot pre-compute a single hash for 'password' and use it to attack multiple accounts; they would need to pre-compute hashes for 'password+salt1', 'password+salt2', and so on, for every possible salt value, which is computationally infeasible for sufficiently large salts. A salt is a random string added to a password before applying the hash function."
Compare the purpose of salting with the general goal of password storage.,"The general goal of password storage is to prevent passwords from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. Salting contributes to this goal by specifically reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. A salt, a unique random string added to a password before hashing, makes it significantly harder for attackers to crack large numbers of hashes simultaneously, thereby slowing down offline attacks and making the overall password storage more secure. Password storage involves keeping passwords in a way that protects them from attackers."
What are the differences between a one-way function and a two-way function in data security?,"A one-way function, such as hashing, is a process where data is transformed in such a way that it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original input from the output. For example, it's impossible to \""decrypt\"" a hash to get the original plaintext value. A two-way function, such as encryption, is a process where data is transformed, but the original data can be retrieved from the transformed data if a specific key is known. This means the process can be reversed or \""decrypted\"" to recover the original plaintext. A key is a piece of information, typically a string of characters, used to encrypt or decrypt data."
Compare the effectiveness of brute force attacks against unsalted hashes versus salted hashes.,"Brute force attacks against unsalted hashes can be highly effective, especially when attackers can pre-compute hashes for a large number of potential passwords and compare them against all stored hashes. Brute force involves trying every possible candidate password systematically. This allows for parallel processing and efficient cracking. Against salted hashes, brute force attacks are significantly less effective. Since each password has a unique salt, an attacker must perform a separate brute force attempt for each individual password, incorporating its specific salt into the hashing process. For a salt of 'n' bits, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password to cover all possible salt values, making a general brute force attack against a database of salted hashes computationally prohibitive. An n-bit salt refers to a salt value with 'n' bits of randomness."
What are the differences between traditional hashing and modern hashing algorithms regarding salting?,"Traditional hashing algorithms often required manual implementation of salting, meaning developers had to explicitly generate and store salts alongside the hashes. Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, automatically salt the passwords. This means that when these algorithms are used, no additional steps are required by the developer to implement salting, ensuring that passwords are properly protected against common attacks like rainbow tables and pre-computed hash lookups by default. Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 are examples of modern hashing algorithms designed for password storage."
Compare the ability to determine if two users have the same password when using unsalted hashes versus salted hashes.,"When unsalted hashes are used, if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be identical. This allows an attacker to easily identify users sharing the same password by simply comparing hash values. With salted hashes, it is impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because even if two users choose the exact same password, the unique salt added to each password before hashing will result in different stored hash values, effectively obscuring common passwords across users. A unique salt is a distinct random string generated for each individual password."
What are the differences between protecting against rainbow tables with and without salting?,"Without salting, password hashes are highly vulnerable to rainbow tables. A rainbow table is a pre-computed table of hashes for common passwords, which an attacker can use to quickly look up the original password corresponding to a stolen hash. Salting protects against rainbow tables by making them ineffective. Since a unique, randomly generated salt is added to each password before hashing, the hash for a given password becomes unique to that specific password-salt combination. This means a pre-computed rainbow table would need to account for every possible salt value for every possible password, which is computationally infeasible, thus rendering rainbow tables useless. Hashing is the process of transforming data into a fixed-size string of characters."
Compare the storage requirements for unsalted password hashes versus salted password hashes.,"For unsalted password hashes, only the hash value itself needs to be stored. For salted password hashes, both the hash of the password+salt and the salt value itself must be stored. The salt value is stored along with the hash of password+salt. This additional storage for the salt is necessary because the salt is unique for each password and is required during the validation process to re-create the hash for comparison. Password+salt refers to the concatenation of the user's password and its unique salt before hashing."
What are the differences between an attacker obtaining a hashed password and an attacker obtaining an encrypted password?,"If an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot directly retrieve the original plaintext password because hashing is a one-way function. They also cannot enter the hashed password into an application's password field to log in as the victim. They would need to 'crack' the hash to find the original password. If an attacker obtains an encrypted password, and also possesses the decryption key, they can retrieve the original plaintext password because encryption is a two-way function. A decryption key is the specific key required to reverse an encryption process and retrieve the original data."
Compare the role of resource-intensive hash algorithms with the role of salting in slowing down offline attacks.,"Both resource-intensive hash algorithms and salting are crucial for slowing down offline attacks. Resource-intensive hash algorithms inherently make the hashing process slower, meaning an attacker attempting to brute force passwords will take longer for each guess, regardless of salting. Salting, on the other hand, specifically prevents attackers from using pre-computed hashes or cracking multiple passwords simultaneously. It forces them to perform unique hash calculations for each password attempt against each target hash, effectively multiplying the effort required. While resource-intensive algorithms increase the cost per hash calculation, salting increases the *number* of hash calculations an attacker must perform to compromise multiple accounts. A resource-intensive hash algorithm is one designed to require significant computational power and time to execute."
What are the differences between 'decrypting' a password hash and 'cracking' a password hash?,"It is not possible to \""decrypt\"" a password hash because hashing is a one-way function; there is no reverse process to obtain the original plaintext password from its hash. \""Cracking\"" a password hash, however, is possible in some circumstances. Cracking involves guessing potential plaintext passwords, calculating their hashes, and comparing these calculated hashes to the target hash. If a match is found, the attacker has 'cracked' the hash and discovered the original plaintext password, but this is not a decryption process. A password hash is the output of a hash function applied to a password."
"Compare the security of passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms versus those stored with older, less secure methods without best practices.","Passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices, such as automatic salting, should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack. These algorithms are designed to be resource-intensive and incorporate unique salts for each password, making offline attacks computationally prohibitive. Hashing best practices refer to recommended guidelines for securely implementing hashing, including using strong algorithms and salting. In contrast, passwords stored with older, less secure methods, especially without best practices like salting, are significantly more vulnerable. Attackers can leverage high-speed hardware like GPUs and cloud services to perform successful password cracking at a relatively small cost, particularly against unsalted hashes or those generated by weaker algorithms. GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are specialized electronic circuits designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images, also used for general-purpose computation."
What are the differences between an attacker using lists of compromised passwords and using brute force to crack hashes?,"When cracking hashes, an attacker can use lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites. This method involves taking known passwords from breaches and hashing them to compare against the target hashes. Compromised sites are websites or services that have had their security breached, leading to data theft. Brute force, on the other hand, involves systematically trying every possible candidate password, starting from simple combinations and increasing complexity, until a match is found. Both are methods for selecting candidate passwords to hash and compare, but lists from compromised sites rely on existing known passwords, while brute force attempts to discover unknown ones by exhaustive search. Candidate passwords are the potential passwords an attacker tries during a cracking attempt."
Compare the impact of an n-bit salt on an attacker's pre-computation efforts versus no salt.,"Without a salt, an attacker can pre-compute hashes for common passwords once and use them to attack any number of stored hashes. This is highly efficient. With an n-bit salt, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the *same password* to cover all possible salt values. This means that for each potential password, the attacker would have to generate a hash for that password combined with every possible n-bit salt. This dramatically increases the computational burden, making pre-computation for a large number of passwords and salts practically infeasible and significantly reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks. An n-bit salt is a salt value with a length of 'n' bits, implying a large number of possible unique salt values (2^n)."
What are the differences between password validation using hashing and password retrieval using encryption?,"Password validation using hashing involves taking a user's entered password, hashing it, and comparing the resulting hash to the stored hash. If they match, the password is valid. The original password is never retrieved. Password validation is the process of checking if an entered password matches the stored password. Password retrieval using encryption, however, would involve decrypting a stored encrypted password using a key to obtain the original plaintext password. While encryption allows for retrieval, passwords should be hashed for validation, not encrypted, to prevent the original password from being exposed even if the storage is compromised. Password retrieval is the process of recovering the original password."
Compare the security provided by storing plaintext passwords versus storing hashed passwords.,"Storing plaintext passwords offers no security; if an attacker gains access to the storage, all original passwords are immediately exposed. Storing hashed passwords provides a significant security improvement. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning even if an attacker obtains the hashed passwords, they cannot directly retrieve the original plaintext values. They would have to 'crack' the hashes, which can be made effectively impossible with strong hashing algorithms and best practices like salting. Plaintext passwords are passwords stored in their original, readable form."
What are the differences between a salt being a fixed value versus a unique value for each password?,"If a salt were a fixed value, it would be added to all passwords before hashing. While this would still change the hashes, an attacker could learn this fixed salt and then pre-compute hashes using that specific salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table-like attacks tailored to that salt. A fixed salt is a single salt value used for all passwords. However, a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to *each* password. This uniqueness for every user means an attacker cannot pre-compute hashes that work across multiple accounts, as each password-salt combination produces a distinct hash, forcing individual cracking attempts and significantly increasing the attacker's effort. A unique salt is a distinct random string generated for each individual password."
Compare the impact of salting on an attacker's ability to identify common passwords across users.,"Without salting, if multiple users choose the same common password, their stored hashes will be identical. An attacker can easily identify these common passwords by looking for duplicate hash values in a compromised database. With salting, this is impossible. Since each password has its own unique, randomly generated salt, even if two users have the exact same password, the different salts will result in different hashes. This prevents an attacker from determining whether two users share the same password by simply comparing hash values, thus enhancing user privacy and security. A common password is a password frequently used by many individuals."
What are the differences between the 'add salt' step and the 'hash function' step in password salting?,"In password salting, the 'add salt' step involves taking the original password and concatenating it with a unique, randomly generated string called a salt. This creates a combined string (password+salt). The 'hash function' step then takes this combined string (password+salt) as its input and applies a cryptographic hash algorithm to produce a fixed-size output, which is the final hash value. A cryptographic hash algorithm is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size. The purpose of adding the salt first is to ensure that even identical passwords produce different hashes, making pre-computed attacks ineffective."
"Compare the security benefits of using Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 with older, non-salting-aware hash functions.","Modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 offer superior security benefits compared to older, non-salting-aware hash functions primarily because they automatically salt passwords. This means they inherently incorporate a unique, randomly generated string (salt) into the hashing process for each password, without requiring additional steps from the developer. This automatic salting protects against pre-computed hash attacks like rainbow tables and makes it significantly harder for attackers to crack multiple passwords simultaneously. Older hash functions, without built-in salting, are vulnerable to these attacks unless salting is manually and correctly implemented, which is often overlooked or done incorrectly. Automatic salting means the hashing algorithm handles the generation and application of a unique salt without explicit developer intervention."
What are the differences between an attacker using brute force and using dictionaries/wordlists to select candidate passwords?,"When cracking password hashes, an attacker can select candidate passwords using different methods. Brute force involves trying every possible combination of characters, systematically generating and testing all permutations until the correct password is found. This is exhaustive but can be very time-consuming. Dictionaries or wordlists, on the other hand, involve using pre-compiled lists of common passwords, words, and phrases. A dictionary or wordlist is a pre-compiled list of common passwords, words, and phrases used in cracking attempts. This method is faster than brute force if the victim's password is on the list, as it focuses on frequently used passwords rather than generating every possible combination."
Compare the impact of salting on the ability to use database-based lookups for cracking passwords versus without salting.,"Without salting, if an attacker compromises a database and obtains hashes, they could potentially use another database of known plaintext-hash pairs (a database-based lookup) to quickly find matches for the stolen hashes. A database-based lookup involves comparing stolen hashes against a database of known plaintext-hash pairs. This is similar to a rainbow table attack. With salting, this approach becomes ineffective. Since each password is combined with a unique, randomly generated salt before hashing, the resulting hash is unique even for identical passwords. Therefore, a database of pre-computed plaintext-hash pairs would not be useful unless it contained entries for every possible password-salt combination, which is computationally infeasible. Salting thus protects against such database-based lookups."
What are the differences between the security provided by a strong password alone and a strong password combined with modern hashing algorithms and best practices?,"A strong password alone, while important, is not sufficient to guarantee security if the underlying storage mechanism is weak. If a strong password is hashed using an outdated algorithm or without salting, it can still be vulnerable to offline attacks, especially with high-speed cracking hardware. A strong password is one that is long, complex, and difficult to guess. However, a strong password combined with modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 and best practices (which include automatic salting) provides significantly enhanced security. This combination makes it effectively impossible for an attacker to crack the password, even with substantial computational resources, because the hashing process is resource-intensive and unique for each password due to salting."
Compare the process of password validation when using unsalted hashes versus salted hashes.,"When using unsalted hashes for password validation, the system takes the user's entered password, hashes it, and then compares this newly generated hash directly to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct. When using salted hashes, the process is slightly more involved. The system retrieves the stored hash *and* the unique salt associated with that user's password. It then takes the user's entered password, combines it with the retrieved salt, hashes this combined string (password+salt), and finally compares the result to the stored hash. This ensures that the correct salt is used for validation, maintaining the security benefits of salting. Password validation is the process of verifying if an entered password is correct."
What are the differences between an attacker's cost for cracking passwords when best practices for hashing are followed versus when they are not?,"When best practices for hashing are not followed, such as using weak algorithms or not salting passwords, the cost to an attacker for successful password cracking is relatively small. They can leverage high-speed hardware like GPUs and cloud services to efficiently pre-compute hashes or brute force many passwords. Cloud services are computing resources (like servers, storage, databases) provided over the internet. However, when best practices for hashing are followed, including using strong, resource-intensive modern hashing algorithms and automatic salting, the cost to an attacker becomes significantly higher, making it effectively impossible to crack passwords. The increased computational effort required per hash and the inability to use pre-computed tables make the attack economically unfeasible."
Compare the security risk of an attacker obtaining a hashed password versus an attacker obtaining the original plaintext password.,"An attacker obtaining the original plaintext password poses the highest security risk, as they can immediately use it to log in as the victim or for other malicious purposes. An attacker obtaining a hashed password presents a lower, but still significant, risk. Since hashing is a one-way function, the attacker cannot directly retrieve the plaintext password. They must expend computational effort to 'crack' the hash by guessing passwords and comparing their hashes. However, if the hashing practices are weak (e.g., no salting, weak algorithm), cracking can still be relatively easy and lead to the exposure of the plaintext password."
What are the differences between how salting protects against pre-computed hashes and how it makes cracking large numbers of hashes harder?,"Salting protects against pre-computed hashes by ensuring that a unique, randomly generated string (salt) is added to each password before hashing. This means that a pre-computed table of common password hashes (like a rainbow table) becomes useless because the hash for 'password' with 'salt1' is different from 'password' with 'salt2'. This directly reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks. Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes harder because, due to the unique salt for every user, an attacker is forced to crack hashes one at a time. They cannot calculate a hash once and compare it against every stored hash; instead, they must perform a separate, unique hash calculation for each password guess against each target hash, meaning the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes they attempt to crack."
Compare the responsibility of an administrator in selecting a hashing algorithm with the automatic salting feature of modern algorithms.,"It is the responsibility of an administrator to select a modern hashing algorithm for password storage. This decision is crucial for security. An administrator is the person responsible for managing and maintaining a computer system or network. Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 simplify this responsibility by automatically salting the passwords. This means that once a modern algorithm is chosen and implemented, the critical security step of adding a unique, randomly generated salt to each password before hashing is handled automatically, without requiring additional manual steps or configurations from the administrator. This ensures that best practices are followed by default."
What are the differences between an attacker trying to log in with a stolen hashed password versus a stolen plaintext password?,"If an attacker steals a hashed password, they cannot use it to log in directly to an application's password field because the application expects a plaintext password to hash and compare. The attacker would first need to 'crack' the hash to obtain the original plaintext password. If an attacker steals a plaintext password, they can immediately enter it into the application's password field and log in as the victim, bypassing any hashing mechanisms and gaining direct access."
Compare the security of a password stored with a weak hash function and salting versus a strong hash function without salting.,"A password stored with a weak hash function, even with salting, might still be vulnerable because the underlying hashing process itself could be easily reversible or have known weaknesses, making the salt less effective. A weak hash function is an algorithm that is either computationally inexpensive to reverse or has known cryptographic vulnerabilities. However, a strong hash function without salting is also highly vulnerable, as it allows attackers to use pre-computed hashes and rainbow tables to efficiently crack passwords. A strong hash function is an algorithm designed to be computationally expensive to reverse and cryptographically secure. The ideal scenario is a strong, resource-intensive hash function *with* salting (preferably automatic salting from modern algorithms) to provide robust protection against various offline attacks."
What are the differences between the 'Illustration' of salting and the textual description of salting's purpose?,"The 'Illustration' visually depicts the process of salting: a 'hello' password has 'add salt' applied to become 'hello3ab9', which then goes through a 'hash function' to produce a hash like '39e19b234...', and finally, the 'hash and salt' are stored. This shows the *mechanism* of salting. The textual description of salting's purpose explains *why* this mechanism is used: to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, by adding a random string (salt) to a password before hashing, ensuring each password has its own salt, and storing the salt with the hash."
Compare the general approach to keeping sensitive data safe using hashing versus encryption.,"Both hashing and encryption are methods to keep sensitive data safe, but they achieve this differently. Hashing is primarily used for integrity checks and password storage where the original data does not need to be retrieved. It transforms data into a fixed-size string (hash) in a one-way manner. Encryption is used when data confidentiality is paramount and the original data must be retrievable. It transforms data into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a key, and can be reversed (decrypted) with the correct key. Sensitive data refers to information that must be protected from unauthorized access to prevent harm."
What are the differences between an attacker's ability to brute force hashes offline and their ability to brute force hashes online?,"The document primarily discusses offline attacks, where an attacker has acquired stored password hashes and can then brute force them without interacting with the live application. This allows them to try a vast number of guesses without triggering account lockout policies or rate limits that would be present in an online system. An online brute force attack would involve attempting to guess passwords directly against a live system, which is typically protected by rate limiting, account lockouts, and other defenses. The implication is that offline brute force is a significant threat because it is unconstrained by typical online security measures, making it faster and more scalable for the attacker."
Compare the impact of salting on the time required to crack a single password versus cracking a large number of passwords.,"Salting primarily impacts the time required to crack a *large number* of passwords. Without salting, an attacker can pre-compute hashes and potentially crack many passwords simultaneously with minimal additional effort per password. With salting, because each password has a unique salt, an attacker is forced to crack hashes one at a time. This means the time required to crack a large number of hashes grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making it significantly harder and more time-consuming. While salting might add a tiny overhead to cracking a *single* password (due to needing to use its specific salt), its main benefit is preventing efficient large-scale cracking."
What are the differences between the security provided by a password stored with a unique salt and one stored with a common salt shared across multiple users?,"A password stored with a unique salt for each user provides robust security against pre-computed attacks and makes it impossible to determine if two users have the same password. The attacker must crack each hash individually. If a common salt were shared across multiple users, it would diminish the security benefits significantly. A common salt is a single salt value used for multiple passwords or users. An attacker could discover this common salt and then pre-compute hashes using that specific salt, effectively creating a rainbow table tailored to that common salt. This would allow them to efficiently crack all passwords using that shared salt, undermining the primary purpose of salting."
Compare the role of an administrator in selecting a modern hashing algorithm with the role of the algorithm itself in ensuring security.,"The administrator's role is critical in selecting a modern hashing algorithm, as this choice dictates the foundational security of password storage. The administrator must ensure that a robust algorithm like Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 is chosen. The role of the algorithm itself is to then execute the hashing process securely. Modern algorithms inherently provide features like automatic salting and are designed to be resource-intensive, making them resistant to brute-force and pre-computation attacks. So, the administrator makes the initial crucial decision, and the algorithm then performs the secure transformation and protection of passwords."
What are the differences between the initial steps of cracking an unsalted password hash and the final step of knowing the plaintext password?,"The initial steps of cracking an unsalted password hash involve selecting a password a victim might have chosen and calculating its hash. This is the preparation phase where the attacker generates a candidate hash. The final step, if a match is found between the calculated hash and the victim's stored hash, is that the attacker has correctly \""cracked\"" the hash and now knows the plaintext value of their password. This signifies the successful compromise, moving from a hash comparison to the revelation of the original secret."
Compare the security implications of storing the salt separately from the hash versus storing it along with the hash.,"The document states that the salt value is stored along with the hash of password+salt. This is the standard and recommended practice. Storing the salt along with the hash ensures that when the hash is retrieved for validation, its corresponding unique salt is also available to correctly re-hash the user's input. Storing it separately, if it implies not storing it at all or making it difficult to retrieve with the hash, would undermine the salting process, as the system would not know which salt to use for validation, or an attacker might obtain hashes without their necessary salts, making them effectively unsalted."
What are the differences between the general concept of 'password storage' and the specific technique of 'salting'?,"Password storage refers to the overall essential practice of keeping passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised. This includes choosing appropriate hashing algorithms and following best practices. Salting is a specific technique *within* password storage, where a unique, randomly generated string (salt) is added to each password before it is hashed. Its primary purpose is to enhance the security of password storage by reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks, such as those using pre-computed hashes or rainbow tables."
Compare the impact of high-speed hardware (like GPUs) on cracking passwords when best practices are followed versus when they are not.,"When best practices for hashing are not followed, high-speed hardware such as GPUs and cloud services with many servers significantly reduce the cost and time for an attacker to perform successful password cracking. The raw computational power of GPUs can rapidly generate and compare hashes, making brute-force and pre-computation attacks very efficient. However, when best practices are followed, including using strong, resource-intensive modern hashing algorithms and automatic salting, the impact of high-speed hardware is mitigated. While GPUs still offer speed, the inherent design of these algorithms (being slow by design) and the need for unique calculations per password due to salting make even GPU-accelerated cracking effectively impossible for strong passwords."
What are the differences between an attacker trying to 'crack' a hash and an attacker trying to 'decrypt' an encrypted password?,"An attacker trying to 'crack' a hash is attempting to find the original plaintext password by guessing and hashing candidate passwords, then comparing the results to the target hash. This is a trial-and-error process because hashing is a one-way function and cannot be reversed. An attacker trying to 'decrypt' an encrypted password is attempting to reverse the encryption process to obtain the original plaintext password. This is possible if they have the correct decryption key, as encryption is a two-way function designed for reversible transformation. A decryption key is the specific key needed to reverse an encryption process."
"Compare the security of a system that uses a single, global salt for all passwords versus a system that uses a unique salt for each password.","A system using a single, global salt for all passwords would offer some protection against generic rainbow tables, as the hashes would be different from standard unsalted hashes. However, once an attacker discovers this global salt, they could then generate a rainbow table specifically for that salt, effectively making all passwords vulnerable to pre-computed attacks. A global salt is a single salt value applied to all passwords in a system. A system using a unique salt for each password provides much stronger security. Because each salt is unique and randomly generated, an attacker cannot create a single pre-computed table that works for multiple passwords. They are forced to crack each password individually, significantly increasing the computational effort and time required for a successful attack."
What are the differences between the initial compromise of an application/database and the subsequent offline brute-force of hashes?,"The initial compromise of an application or database refers to the event where an attacker gains unauthorized access to the system where passwords (or their hashes) are stored. This is the first step in the attack chain. The subsequent offline brute-force of hashes occurs *after* the attacker has acquired these stored password hashes. At this stage, the attacker works independently of the compromised system, using their own computational resources to systematically guess and hash potential passwords, comparing them against the stolen hashes to discover the original plaintext values. This offline process is often unconstrained by the target system's security measures. A compromise refers to unauthorized access to a system or data."
Compare the security benefits of salting passwords with the security benefits of selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible.,"Both salting passwords and selecting resource-intensive hash algorithms are crucial for enhancing password security. Salting primarily protects against pre-computed attacks like rainbow tables and database-based lookups by ensuring each password produces a unique hash, even if the plaintext is the same. This forces attackers to crack hashes one at a time. Resource-intensive hash algorithms, on the other hand, inherently make each individual hash calculation slower and more computationally expensive. This directly slows down brute-force attacks by increasing the time it takes for an attacker to test each password guess, regardless of whether salting is used. Together, they form a robust defense: salting prevents efficient large-scale attacks, while resource-intensive algorithms make individual cracking attempts more costly."
What are the differences between the general concept of 'password cracking' and the specific method of using 'dictionaries or wordlists'?,"Password cracking is the overarching process by which an attacker attempts to discover the original plaintext password from its hash. This involves selecting candidate passwords, hashing them, and comparing the result to the target hash. Using 'dictionaries or wordlists' is a specific method *within* password cracking for selecting these candidate passwords. Instead of trying every possible character combination (brute force), this method focuses on a pre-compiled list of commonly used passwords, words, and phrases, which can be more efficient if the victim's password is a common one."
Compare the security of passwords stored without any protection versus those stored with hashing and salting.,"Passwords stored without any protection, such as in plaintext, are completely vulnerable. If an attacker gains access to the storage, all passwords are immediately exposed and usable. Passwords stored with hashing and salting provide significantly enhanced security. Hashing transforms the password into a one-way hash, making it impossible to retrieve the original plaintext directly. Salting, by adding a unique random string to each password before hashing, further protects against offline attacks like rainbow tables and brute force, making it extremely difficult for an attacker to crack multiple passwords even if the hashes are compromised. This combination makes cracking effectively impossible for strong passwords."
What are the differences between an attacker trying to guess a password directly versus trying to crack its hash?,"An attacker trying to guess a password directly typically implies an online attack, where they attempt to log in to a system by trying various passwords. This method is usually limited by account lockout policies, rate limits, and other online security measures. An attacker trying to crack its hash, however, implies an offline attack. Here, the attacker has already obtained the password hashes from a compromised system. They then use their own computational resources to guess potential passwords, hash them, and compare the results to the stolen hashes. This offline process is not constrained by the target system's defenses, allowing for a much higher volume of guesses."
"Compare the impact of a small salt size (e.g., 1-bit) versus a large salt size (e.g., 64-bit) on an attacker's pre-computation efforts.","A small salt size, such as a 1-bit salt, would mean there are only 2^1 = 2 possible salt values. An attacker could easily pre-compute hashes for common passwords for each of these two salt values, effectively creating two small rainbow tables. This offers minimal protection. A large salt size, such as a 64-bit salt, means there are 2^64 possible salt values. For an attacker to pre-compute hashes for the same password across all these salt values would require an astronomically large amount of computation (2^64 hashes for each password). This makes pre-computation practically infeasible and renders pre-computed attacks, like rainbow tables, ineffective, significantly enhancing security."
"What are the differences between the security provided by a password stored with a modern hashing algorithm and one stored with an older, non-resource-intensive algorithm?","A password stored with a modern hashing algorithm, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2, benefits from the algorithm's design to be resource-intensive. This means each hash calculation takes a significant amount of time and computational power, inherently slowing down brute-force attacks. These algorithms also typically include automatic salting. In contrast, an older, non-resource-intensive algorithm generates hashes very quickly. While it still produces a hash, its speed makes it highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks, as an attacker can test a vast number of password guesses in a short period, especially with high-speed hardware, even if salting is manually applied. The resource-intensive nature of modern algorithms is a key defense mechanism."
Compare the process of an attacker selecting a password they think the victim has chosen with the process of calculating its hash.,"The process of an attacker selecting a password they think the victim has chosen is the initial guessing phase in cracking. This involves using methods like dictionaries, wordlists, or common password patterns to identify potential plaintext passwords. Once a candidate password is selected, the next step is to calculate its hash. This involves applying the same hash function used by the system to the selected candidate password (and its corresponding salt, if applicable). The calculated hash is then used for comparison against the victim's stored hash. So, selection is about guessing the plaintext, and calculation is about transforming that guess into a hash for verification."
What are the differences between the security provided by a password stored with a unique salt and one stored without any salt?,"A password stored without any salt is highly vulnerable to offline attacks, particularly those using pre-computed hashes like rainbow tables. If an attacker obtains the hash, they can quickly look up the original password if it's in their pre-computed tables. A password stored with a unique salt, however, provides significantly stronger security. The unique, randomly generated salt added to each password before hashing ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes. This renders pre-computed tables ineffective and forces an attacker to crack each password individually, dramatically increasing the time and computational resources required for a successful attack."
