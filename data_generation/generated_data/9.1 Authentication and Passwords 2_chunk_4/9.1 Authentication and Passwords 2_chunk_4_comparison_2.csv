Compare hashing with encryption in terms of data retrieval.,"Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. In contrast, encryption is a two-way function, which means the original plaintext data can be retrieved if the correct key is available."
What are the key differences between hashing and encryption for sensitive data protection?,"Both hashing and encryption provide ways to keep sensitive data safe. However, hashing is a one-way function, making it impossible to retrieve the original plaintext value from a hash. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved if the key is known."
Explain why passwords should be hashed and not encrypted.,"Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted, because hashing is a one-way function. This means that once a password has been hashed, it is impossible to ""decrypt"" it to obtain the original plaintext value. This is appropriate for password validation, as the system only needs to verify if an entered password's hash matches the stored hash, without needing to know the original password. Encryption, being a two-way function, would allow the original password to be retrieved if the key were compromised, posing a security risk."
How does the reversibility of hashing compare to that of encryption?,"Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is irreversible; it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. Encryption, conversely, is a two-way function, which means the original plaintext can be retrieved from the encrypted data if the correct decryption key is possessed."
What is the primary functional difference between hashing and encryption?,"The primary functional difference is that hashing is a one-way function, making it impossible to reverse and obtain the original plaintext value. Encryption, however, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved given the appropriate key."
Compare hashing and encryption in terms of their suitability for password validation.,"Hashing is appropriate for password validation because it is a one-way function. This means that even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot ""decrypt"" it to get the original plaintext and log in as the victim. The system only needs to compare the hash of an entered password with the stored hash. Encryption, being a two-way function, would allow the original password to be retrieved if the key were compromised, making it less suitable for password validation where the original password should remain unknown."
"If an attacker obtains a hashed password versus an encrypted password, what is the difference in their ability to log in as the victim?","If an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim because hashing is a one-way function and the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved. If an attacker obtains an encrypted password and the corresponding key, they could potentially decrypt it to retrieve the original plaintext password and then log in as the victim, as encryption is a two-way function."
How do hashing and encryption differ in their ability to protect sensitive data from being revealed in its original form?,"Hashing protects sensitive data by transforming it into a fixed-size string from which the original data cannot be retrieved, as it is a one-way function. Encryption protects sensitive data by transforming it into an unreadable format that can be reverted to its original form only with the correct key, as it is a two-way function."
What is the difference between a one-way function and a two-way function in the context of data security?,"A one-way function, such as hashing, is a process where data is transformed in such a way that it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original data. A two-way function, such as encryption, is a process where data is transformed and can be reversed to obtain the original data, provided the correct key is used."
Compare the security implications of storing passwords using hashing versus encryption.,"Storing passwords using hashing is recommended because hashing is a one-way function, meaning the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved even if the hash is compromised. This prevents an attacker from logging in as the victim. Storing passwords using encryption, a two-way function, means the original plaintext password could be retrieved if the encryption key is compromised, posing a significant security risk."
"What role does ""decryption"" play in hashing compared to encryption?","""Decryption"" is a concept applicable to encryption, which is a two-way function designed to allow the retrieval of original plaintext data using a key. In contrast, hashing is a one-way function where ""decryption"" is impossible; one cannot reverse the hash function to obtain the original plaintext value."
How do hashing and encryption contribute to keeping sensitive data safe?,"Both hashing and encryption contribute to keeping sensitive data safe by transforming it. Hashing does so by creating a unique, fixed-size representation from which the original data cannot be recovered, suitable for validation without revealing the original. Encryption does so by scrambling data into an unreadable format that can only be restored to its original state with a specific key, suitable for protecting data that needs to be accessed later."
What distinguishes hashing from encryption regarding the ability to recover the original plaintext?,"Hashing is distinguished from encryption by its inability to recover the original plaintext. Hashing is a one-way function, making it impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash to obtain the original value. Encryption, conversely, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved if the correct key is available."
Compare password salting with unsalted password hashing in terms of offline attack effectiveness.,"Password salting significantly reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. A salt, which is a random string unique to each password, is added before hashing. This means an attacker cannot use pre-computed hashes for common passwords. With unsalted hashing, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords and quickly compare them against stolen hashes."
What are the differences between cracking salted hashes and cracking unsalted hashes?,"Cracking salted hashes is significantly harder than cracking unsalted hashes. For salted hashes, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective unique salt for each user, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes much more time-consuming, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. Unsalted hashes, however, can be cracked more efficiently, often using pre-computed hashes or rainbow tables, because the same hash value will always result from the same password."
How does salting impact an attacker's ability to use pre-computed hashes?,"Salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. A salt, which is a random string, is added to a password before applying the hash function. Since each password has its own unique salt, an attacker cannot pre-compute a single set of hashes for common passwords and apply them universally. Instead, for a salt of nbit, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2n of hashes for the same password, making pre-computation for a large number of passwords impractical."
Compare the storage requirements for salted passwords versus unsalted passwords.,"For salted passwords, the salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This means slightly more storage is required compared to unsalted passwords, where only the hash value itself needs to be stored. However, the added security benefits of salting far outweigh the minimal increase in storage."
"What is the role of a ""salt"" in password security, and how does it differ from a simple hash?","A ""salt"" is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. Its role is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes and to make cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder. A simple hash, without a salt, would produce the same output for identical passwords, making them vulnerable to rainbow tables and pre-computed attacks. The salt ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes because their unique salts are incorporated."
How does salting protect against rainbow tables or database-based lookups compared to unsalted hashing?,"Salting protects against rainbow tables or database-based lookups because each password has a unique, randomly generated salt added to it before hashing. This means that even if two users have the same password, their different salts will result in different hashes. Rainbow tables and database-based lookups rely on pre-computed hashes for common passwords, which become ineffective when unique salts are used, as the attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value. Unsalted hashing is highly vulnerable to these methods."
Compare the effort required for an attacker to crack a large number of salted hashes versus unsalted hashes.,"The effort required for an attacker to crack a large number of salted hashes is significantly greater than for unsalted hashes. With salting, an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each user. This means the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. For unsalted hashes, an attacker can calculate a hash once (or use pre-computed tables) and compare it against many stored hashes, making the process much faster and less resource-intensive for large datasets."
What is the impact of salting on determining if two users have the same password?,"Salting makes it impossible to determine whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because different salts will result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical. Without salting, if two users had the same password, their stored hashes would be identical, making it easy to identify duplicate passwords."
How does the uniqueness of a salt per password enhance security compared to a universal salt or no salt?,"The uniqueness of a salt for every password significantly enhances security because it forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt. This prevents the use of pre-computed hashes (like rainbow tables) or the efficiency gained from calculating a hash once and comparing it against many stored hashes. A universal salt would still allow for pre-computation for that specific salt, and no salt would leave passwords vulnerable to general pre-computed hash attacks."
Explain how salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks.,"Salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks by adding a unique, randomly generated string, called a salt, to each password before the hash function is applied. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed hashes, such as those found in rainbow tables, because each password-salt combination produces a unique hash. Consequently, an attacker must compute hashes individually for each password attempt, significantly increasing the time and computational resources required to crack passwords offline."
What is the primary purpose of adding a salt to a password before hashing?,"The primary purpose of adding a salt to a password before hashing is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that use pre-computed hashes. By making each password's hash unique, even if the passwords themselves are identical, salting prevents attackers from using rainbow tables or other pre-computation techniques to quickly crack multiple passwords."
Compare the security provided by a password hashed with a unique salt per user versus a password hashed without any salt.,"A password hashed with a unique salt per user provides significantly higher security than one hashed without any salt. The unique salt, a random string added before hashing, ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes, making pre-computed hash attacks (like rainbow tables) ineffective. An attacker must crack each hash individually. Without any salt, identical passwords yield identical hashes, making them vulnerable to pre-computed attacks and allowing an attacker to easily identify users with the same password."
How does the computational burden on an attacker change when cracking salted passwords compared to unsalted ones?,"The computational burden on an attacker dramatically increases when cracking salted passwords compared to unsalted ones. For salted passwords, the attacker needs to compute hashes for each password attempt combined with its unique salt, effectively forcing a brute-force or dictionary attack for each individual hash. For an nbit salt, they need to pre-compute 2n of hashes for the same password. With unsalted passwords, an attacker can pre-compute a large number of common password hashes once and then compare them against all stolen hashes, significantly reducing the overall computational burden."
What are the implications of not using salting for password storage?,"Not using salting for password storage has several negative implications. It makes passwords highly vulnerable to offline attacks using pre-computed hashes and rainbow tables, as identical passwords will yield identical hashes. An attacker can easily identify users with the same password and crack multiple passwords simultaneously with less computational effort. This significantly reduces the security of stored passwords."
How does salting make cracking large numbers of hashes harder?,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the salt is unique for every user. This means an attacker cannot calculate a hash once and compare it against every stored hash. Instead, the attacker has to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each password. Consequently, the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale cracking much more resource-intensive and time-consuming."
Compare the vulnerability to rainbow tables for salted versus unsalted password hashes.,"Salted password hashes are protected against rainbow tables, whereas unsalted password hashes are highly vulnerable. Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables of hashes for common passwords. Because salting adds a unique, random string to each password before hashing, even identical passwords will produce different hashes. This renders pre-computed rainbow tables ineffective, as an attacker would need a unique rainbow table for every possible salt value."
What is the difference in how an attacker approaches cracking a single salted hash versus a single unsalted hash?,"When cracking a single salted hash, an attacker must combine their guessed password with the specific salt associated with that hash and then compute the hash. This process must be repeated for each password guess. For a single unsalted hash, the attacker simply computes the hash of their guessed password and compares it directly, without needing to consider an additional salt value."
"How does the ""random string"" aspect of a salt contribute to password security compared to a fixed string?","The ""random string"" aspect of a salt is crucial for password security because it ensures that each salt is unique and unpredictable. If a fixed string were used as a salt, it would essentially become part of the hashing algorithm, and attackers could still pre-compute hashes for that specific fixed string, negating many of the benefits of salting. A random string ensures that each password-salt combination is unique, making pre-computation attacks impractical."
Compare the security benefits of storing only the hash of a password versus storing the hash of password+salt.,"Storing the hash of password+salt provides significantly greater security benefits than storing only the hash of a password. When only the hash of a password is stored, identical passwords result in identical hashes, making them vulnerable to pre-computed attacks and allowing attackers to identify users with the same password. By storing the hash of password+salt, where the salt is unique for each password, even identical passwords produce different hashes, effectively thwarting pre-computed attacks and making it impossible to determine if two users share the same password without cracking each hash individually."
What is the difference in how an attacker would use a dictionary attack against salted versus unsalted password hashes?,"When using a dictionary attack against unsalted password hashes, an attacker can hash each word in their dictionary once and then compare those hashes against all stolen password hashes. For salted password hashes, an attacker must take each word from their dictionary, combine it with the specific salt for a given user's hash, compute the new hash, and then compare it. This process must be repeated for every dictionary word against every unique salted hash, dramatically increasing the computational cost and time required."
"How do modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 compare to older methods regarding salting?","Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt the passwords. This means that when using these algorithms, no additional steps are required by the administrator to implement salting, as it is an inherent part of their design. Older or less secure hashing methods often require manual implementation of salting or do not support it, leaving passwords vulnerable if not explicitly handled."
Compare the responsibility of an administrator in implementing salting with modern hashing algorithms versus older ones.,"With modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, the responsibility of an administrator for implementing salting is minimal, as these algorithms automatically salt the passwords. No additional steps are required. With older hashing algorithms, an administrator would have the explicit responsibility to manually generate and add a unique salt to each password before hashing and store it alongside the hash, requiring more careful implementation to ensure security."
Compare brute force attacks with dictionary attacks as methods for cracking password hashes.,"Brute force attacks involve trying every possible candidate password until a match is found. This method is exhaustive but can be very time-consuming for complex passwords. Dictionary attacks, on the other hand, involve trying passwords from a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, or previously compromised passwords (a dictionary or wordlist). Dictionary attacks are generally faster if the password is in the list but are not exhaustive. Both are methods attackers use to crack password hashes."
What are the differences between using lists of passwords from compromised sites and brute force for cracking password hashes?,"Using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites involves comparing known plaintext passwords (or their hashes) from breaches against the target hashes. This method is highly effective if the victim reused a password. Brute force, however, involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. While exhaustive, brute force can be extremely time-consuming, especially for long and complex passwords."
Compare the effectiveness of different methods attackers use to select candidate passwords for cracking.,"Attackers use different methods to select candidate passwords, each with varying effectiveness. Using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites can be highly effective if users reuse passwords across services. Brute force, which involves trying every possible candidate, is exhaustive and guaranteed to find the password eventually but can be extremely time-consuming. Dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords are faster than brute force but only effective if the password is included in the list."
What are the differences between a dictionary attack and a wordlist attack in the context of password cracking?,"In the context of password cracking, dictionary attacks and wordlist attacks are largely synonymous. Both involve using pre-compiled lists of common passwords, words, or phrases as candidate passwords to try and match against a target hash. The terms refer to the same method of attempting to crack passwords by testing a finite set of likely passwords."
How do resource-intensive hash algorithms compare to less intensive ones in slowing down offline attacks?,"Resource-intensive hash algorithms are more effective at slowing down offline attacks compared to less intensive ones. As a defender, selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible increases the computational cost and time an attacker needs to brute force hashes offline. This makes the cracking process slower and more expensive for the attacker, thereby enhancing security."
What is the difference in how an attacker might leverage high-speed hardware for cracking passwords compared to standard hardware?,"An attacker leveraging high-speed hardware, such as GPUs, or cloud services with many servers for rent, can perform password cracking significantly faster and at a relatively small cost compared to using standard hardware. This increased computational power allows them to try a much larger number of permutations in a shorter amount of time, making successful password cracking more feasible, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed."
Compare the difficulty of cracking strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and best practices versus weak passwords or poor hashing practices.,"Strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack. This is due to the combination of password complexity, the resource-intensiveness of modern algorithms, and features like automatic salting. In contrast, weak passwords or those stored using poor hashing practices (e.g., unsalted, non-resource-intensive algorithms) are significantly easier and faster for attackers to crack, even with relatively modest computational resources."
What are the differences in the types of passwords an attacker might target with a dictionary attack versus a brute force attack?,"With a dictionary attack, an attacker primarily targets passwords that are common words, phrases, or known leaked passwords, as these are found in pre-compiled wordlists. With a brute force attack, an attacker targets any password, regardless of its complexity or commonality, by systematically trying every possible character combination. Brute force is exhaustive but computationally intensive, while dictionary attacks are faster but limited to the words in the dictionary."
"Compare the concept of ""decrypting"" password hashes with ""cracking"" them.","It is not possible to ""decrypt"" password hashes because hashing is a one-way function, meaning the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved from the hash. However, it is possible to ""crack"" password hashes. Cracking involves guessing potential plaintext passwords, hashing them, and then comparing the resulting hash to the target hash. If a match is found, the original plaintext password has been ""cracked"" or discovered."
What are the differences between an offline attack and an online attack (implied) in the context of password cracking?,"The document primarily focuses on offline attacks, which occur when an attacker has acquired stored password hashes and attempts to brute force or crack them without direct interaction with the live application or database. This allows them to try a vast number of guesses without triggering account lockouts or rate limits. While not explicitly defined, an online attack would involve attempting to guess passwords directly against the live system, typically facing limitations like rate limiting and account lockouts."
Compare the security posture of an application that stores passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained versus one where they might be obtained if the database is compromised.,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database is compromised. An application with a strong security posture would use robust hashing algorithms with salting, making it effectively impossible for an attacker to crack passwords even if the hashes are stolen. An application where passwords (or easily crackable hashes) might be obtained upon compromise is inherently less secure, as attackers can then brute force hashes offline."
What is the difference in the goal of a defender versus an attacker regarding password hashes?,"The goal of a defender is to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised, and to slow down offline attacks as much as possible by selecting resource-intensive hash algorithms. The goal of an attacker, conversely, is to acquire stored password hashes and then brute force or crack them offline to obtain the original plaintext passwords."
Compare the cost to an attacker for successful password cracking when best practices are followed versus when they are not.,"When best practices for hashing are not followed, the cost to an attacker for successful password cracking is relatively small, even with high-speed hardware like GPUs and cloud services. This is because vulnerabilities like unsalted hashes or weak algorithms make cracking more efficient. Conversely, when strong passwords are used with modern hashing algorithms and best practices, it should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack them, implying an astronomically high, if not infinite, cost."
What are the differences between a password hash and a plaintext password?,"A plaintext password is the original, human-readable form of a password. A password hash is the output of a one-way function applied to the plaintext password, resulting in a fixed-size string. It is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash to obtain the original plaintext password. The hash is used for validation, while the plaintext password is what a user enters."
Compare the security implications of an attacker obtaining a hashed password versus obtaining the original plaintext password.,"If an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot directly log in as the victim because hashing is a one-way function, and the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved. They would need to ""crack"" the hash, which can be made effectively impossible with strong passwords and modern hashing algorithms. If an attacker obtains the original plaintext password, they can immediately log in as the victim, as they have the exact credentials. This represents a far greater and more immediate security compromise."
