What is password salting?,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, randomly generated string, known as a salt, to a password before applying a hash function. This process makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder."
Why is salting used in password storage?,"Salting is used in password storage to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, such as rainbow tables or database-based lookups. By adding a unique salt to each password before hashing, it makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder and prevents attackers from determining if two users have the same password, even if the hashes are different."
What is a salt in the context of password security?,"In the context of password security, a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to a password before the hash function is applied. Each password has its own salt, and this salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt."
How is a salt stored in a password system?,The salt value is stored along with the hash of password+salt. This allows the system to retrieve the correct salt when verifying a user's password.
What is the impact of salt length on an attacker's effort to pre-compute hashes?,"For a salt of n-bit, an attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n of hashes for the same password. This means that a longer salt significantly increases the computational effort required for an attacker to pre-compute hashes, thereby making offline attacks much more difficult."
Describe the process of password salting.,"The process of password salting involves taking a user's plaintext password and adding a unique, randomly generated string, called a salt, to it. This combined string (password+salt) is then passed through a hash function to produce a hash value. Finally, this hash value and the salt are stored together."
Why is it essential to store passwords securely?,"It is essential to store passwords securely to prevent them from being obtained by an attacker even if the application or database where they are stored is compromised. Secure storage ensures that even if an attacker gains access to stored password hashes, they cannot easily retrieve the original plaintext passwords or use them to log in as the victim."
What can an attacker do after acquiring stored password hashes?,"After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force hashes offline. This means they can repeatedly try different password guesses, hash them, and compare them against the acquired hashes without needing to interact with the live application, making the cracking process potentially faster and less detectable."
How can defenders slow down offline password attacks?,"As a defender, it is only possible to slow down offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource intensive as possible. This increases the time and computational power required for an attacker to test each potential password, thereby making brute-force attacks less feasible."
What is the main difference between hashing and encryption?,"The main difference between hashing and encryption is that hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. In contrast, encryption is a two-way function, meaning that the original plaintext can be retrieved if the correct key is available. Both provide ways to keep sensitive data safe."
Should passwords be hashed or encrypted for storage?,"Passwords should be hashed, NOT encrypted, for storage. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved from its hash, which is crucial for security. Encryption, being a two-way function, would allow retrieval of the original password if the key were compromised."
Define hashing in the context of data security.,"Hashing, in the context of data security, is a one-way function that transforms an input (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash or message digest. It is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash to obtain the original plaintext value. Hashing is appropriate for password validation because it allows verification without storing the actual password."
Define encryption in the context of data security.,"Encryption, in the context of data security, is a two-way function that transforms plaintext data into ciphertext to protect it. Unlike hashing, encryption allows the original plaintext data to be retrieved from the ciphertext if the correct decryption key is available."
Why is hashing appropriate for password validation?,"Hashing is appropriate for password validation because it is a one-way function. This means that the system can store a hash of the password and, when a user attempts to log in, hash their entered password and compare it to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct, but the original plaintext password is never stored or exposed, enhancing security."
What happens if an attacker obtains a hashed password?,"If an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot enter it directly into an application's password field and log in as the victim. While they cannot ""decrypt"" it, they can attempt to ""crack"" the hash offline by trying various password guesses, hashing them, and comparing the results to the stolen hash."
"Is it possible to ""decrypt"" password hashes to obtain the original passwords?","No, it is not possible to ""decrypt"" password hashes to obtain the original passwords. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning the process is irreversible. However, it is possible to ""crack"" hashes in some circumstances by guessing potential passwords, hashing them, and comparing the resulting hashes to the stolen ones."
How do attackers crack unsalted password hashes?,"Attackers crack unsalted password hashes by following a basic set of steps: First, they select a password they think the victim might have chosen. Second, they calculate the hash of that selected password. Third, they compare the calculated hash to the hash of the victim's password. Finally, if they match, the attacker has successfully ""cracked"" the hash and knows the plaintext value of the password. This process is repeated for a large number of potential candidate passwords."
What are the basic steps an attacker takes to crack an unsalted password hash?,"The basic steps an attacker takes to crack an unsalted password hash are: 1. **Select a password:** The attacker chooses a potential password they believe the victim might have used. 2. **Calculate the hash:** The attacker computes the hash of the selected password using the same hashing algorithm as the target system. 3. **Compare hashes:** The calculated hash is then compared to the victim's stored password hash. 4. **Match:** If the hashes match, the attacker has successfully identified the original plaintext password."
What methods do attackers use to select candidate passwords when cracking hashes?,"Attackers use several methods to select candidate passwords when cracking hashes, including: lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, brute force (trying every possible candidate), and dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords."
"Explain the ""brute force"" method in password cracking.","The ""brute force"" method in password cracking involves systematically trying every possible candidate password until the correct one is found. This method can be very time-consuming but guarantees finding the password if enough computational resources and time are available."
What factors make password cracking relatively inexpensive for attackers?,"Password cracking can be relatively inexpensive for attackers due to the availability of high-speed hardware, such as GPUs, and cloud services that provide many servers for rent. These resources allow attackers to process an enormous number of password permutations quickly, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed by the target system."
How can strong passwords and modern hashing algorithms prevent password cracking?,"Strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack. Modern hashing algorithms are designed to be resource-intensive, making brute-force attacks computationally prohibitive, and when combined with salting, they further protect against pre-computed hash attacks."
What is the administrator's responsibility regarding hashing algorithms?,It is the administrator's responsibility to select a modern hashing algorithm for password storage. Choosing a robust and resource-intensive algorithm is crucial for enhancing the security of stored passwords and making them resistant to cracking attempts.
How does salting make cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder?,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the salt is unique for every user. This forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each, rather than calculating a single hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. Consequently, the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making bulk cracking inefficient."
How does salting protect against rainbow tables?,"Salting protects against rainbow tables by ensuring that each password has a unique salt. A rainbow table is a pre-computed table of hashes for common passwords. Since salting adds a unique random string to each password before hashing, the resulting hash for the same password will be different for every user. This renders pre-computed rainbow tables ineffective, as an attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value, which is computationally infeasible."
How does salting prevent determining if two users have the same password?,"Salting prevents determining whether two users have the same password because each password has its own unique salt. Even if two users choose the exact same password, the different salts added to their passwords before hashing will result in completely different hash values. This makes it impossible for an attacker to identify identical passwords by simply comparing stored hashes."
List some modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Some modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords, requiring no additional steps from the administrator, include Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed with built-in salting mechanisms to enhance security against various cracking techniques."
"What is the purpose of the ""add salt"" step in the password salting illustration?","The purpose of the ""add salt"" step in the password salting illustration is to combine the original plaintext password (""hello"") with a unique, randomly generated string (the salt) before it undergoes the hashing function. This creates a unique input for the hash function, even if the original password is common, thereby enhancing security against pre-computed attacks."
"What does the ""hash function"" step represent in the password salting illustration?","The ""hash function"" step in the password salting illustration represents the cryptographic process that takes the combined password and salt as input and transforms it into a fixed-size, irreversible hash value. This hash value is what is ultimately stored, rather than the original password."
What is the final step in the password salting process shown in the illustration?,"The final step in the password salting process shown in the illustration is to ""store hash and salt."" This means that both the resulting hash value (e.g., ""39e19b234..."") and the unique salt that was added to the password are saved together in the database."
What is the primary goal of secure password storage?,"The primary goal of secure password storage is to prevent passwords from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database storing them is compromised. This involves using techniques like hashing and salting to ensure that original plaintext passwords are never directly accessible."
Why is it important to use resource-intensive hash algorithms?,"It is important to use resource-intensive hash algorithms because they slow down offline attacks. By requiring more computational power and time for each hash calculation, these algorithms make it significantly harder and more expensive for attackers to brute force password hashes, even with powerful hardware."
Can an attacker log in as a victim if they obtain the victim's hashed password?,"No, an attacker cannot log in as a victim by simply obtaining the victim's hashed password. An application's login process typically requires a plaintext password, which it then hashes and compares to the stored hash. Since the attacker only has the hash and cannot reverse it to get the plaintext, they cannot directly use the hash to log in."
"What is an ""offline attack"" in the context of password security?","An ""offline attack"" in the context of password security refers to an attack where an adversary attempts to crack password hashes without directly interacting with the target system or application. Instead, the attacker obtains a list of hashed passwords (e.g., from a compromised database) and then performs brute-force or dictionary attacks on these hashes on their own computing resources."
How does the uniqueness of a salt for every user impact an attacker?,"The uniqueness of a salt for every user significantly impacts an attacker by forcing them to crack each password hash individually. Instead of being able to pre-compute hashes for common passwords once and apply them to all users (as with unsalted hashes), the attacker must perform a separate cracking attempt for each user's salted hash, which dramatically increases the time and resources required."
"What does ""pre-computed hashes"" refer to in the context of password attacks?","""Pre-computed hashes"" refers to lists or tables of hash values that attackers generate in advance for a large number of common or likely passwords. These are then used in offline attacks to quickly find matches against stolen password hashes, without needing to calculate each hash in real-time during the attack. Rainbow tables are a common example of pre-computed hashes."
What is the role of a hash function in password storage?,"The role of a hash function in password storage is to transform a password (often combined with a salt) into a fixed-size, irreversible string of characters, known as a hash. This hash is then stored instead of the actual password. This allows for password verification without ever storing or exposing the plaintext password, enhancing security."
Why is it important that hashing is a one-way function for password security?,"It is important that hashing is a one-way function for password security because it means that even if an attacker gains access to the stored hash values, they cannot reverse the process to obtain the original plaintext passwords. This protects user credentials from being directly compromised even if the database is breached."
"What are ""rainbow tables"" and how do they relate to password security?","Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables used in cryptanalysis to reverse cryptographic hash functions, typically to crack passwords. They store pre-calculated hashes for a vast number of potential passwords. In relation to password security, salting is a key defense mechanism against rainbow tables, as it makes them ineffective by ensuring unique hashes for identical passwords."
"What is the significance of ""PASSWORD SALTING"" as a security measure?","""PASSWORD SALTING"" is a significant security measure because it directly addresses the vulnerability of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. By adding a unique, random salt to each password before hashing, it makes it computationally infeasible for attackers to use rainbow tables or to efficiently brute-force large numbers of hashes, thereby protecting user credentials even if the hash database is compromised."
How does the illustration on page 1 visually represent the salting process?,"The illustration on page 1 visually represents the salting process by showing an initial password ""hello"" being fed into an ""add salt"" step, which transforms it into ""hello3ab9"" (implying ""3ab9"" is the salt added to ""hello""). This salted password then goes through a ""hash function"" to produce a hash value ""39e19b234..."", and finally, both the hash and the salt are stored."
"What does the phrase ""resource intensive as possible"" mean for hash algorithms?","For hash algorithms, ""resource intensive as possible"" means that the algorithm is designed to consume significant computational resources (CPU time, memory) when calculating a hash. This deliberate slowness makes it much more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to perform a large number of hash calculations during an offline brute-force attack, thereby slowing down the cracking process."
Why is it crucial for each password to have its own salt?,"It is crucial for each password to have its own salt because this uniqueness prevents attackers from using pre-computed hashes (like rainbow tables) or from efficiently cracking multiple passwords simultaneously. If all passwords shared the same salt, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for that specific salt, undermining the security benefits of salting."
What is the implication of an attacker needing to pre-compute 2^n hashes for an n-bit salt?,"The implication of an attacker needing to pre-compute 2^n hashes for an n-bit salt is that the computational effort required for an attack grows exponentially with the salt's length. This makes longer salts extremely effective at deterring pre-computation attacks, as the resources needed quickly become prohibitive for the attacker."
How do modern hashing algorithms simplify the salting process for administrators?,"Modern hashing algorithms simplify the salting process for administrators by automatically incorporating salting into their design. Algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 handle the generation and application of unique salts internally, meaning administrators do not need to implement additional steps for salting when using these algorithms."
What is the primary risk if an application or database storing passwords is compromised?,"The primary risk if an application or database storing passwords is compromised is that an attacker could obtain the stored password hashes. Once acquired, these hashes can be subjected to offline brute-force or dictionary attacks, potentially revealing the original plaintext passwords, even if they were hashed."
What is the benefit of hashing and encryption both providing ways to keep sensitive data safe?,"The benefit of both hashing and encryption providing ways to keep sensitive data safe is that they offer different security properties suitable for different use cases. Hashing provides integrity and one-way storage (ideal for passwords), while encryption provides confidentiality and two-way retrieval (ideal for data that needs to be accessed later, like personal information)."
What is the general principle for securing sensitive data like passwords?,"The general principle for securing sensitive data like passwords is to store them in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised. This involves using cryptographic techniques such as hashing, which is a one-way function, rather than encryption, which is a two-way function."
"What is the purpose of the ""Password Storage Cheat Sheet"" document?","The purpose of the ""Password Storage Cheat Sheet"" document is to provide essential information and best practices for storing passwords securely. It covers topics such as the importance of secure storage, how attackers crack hashes, and the role of techniques like salting and modern hashing algorithms in mitigating these threats."
"How does the concept of ""one-way function"" apply to password security?","The concept of a ""one-way function"" applies to password security through hashing. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that while it's easy to compute a hash from a password, it's computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original password from its hash. This is crucial for security because it allows systems to verify passwords without ever storing or needing to retrieve the plaintext password, protecting it even if the stored hashes are compromised."
