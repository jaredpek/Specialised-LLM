Analyse the primary purpose of password salting in the context of security.,"The primary purpose of password salting is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. A **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to a password before applying the hash function. This process ensures that even if an attacker obtains stored password hashes, they cannot easily use pre-computed tables to crack them, as each password will have a unique salt associated with it, requiring individual cracking efforts."
What insights can be derived from the mechanism of password salting?,"The mechanism of password salting involves adding a **salt** (a random string) to a password before applying a **hash function**. The resulting hash of the password+salt is then stored along with the salt value. Key insights include: each password has its own unique salt, which means an attacker cannot use a single pre-computed hash to crack multiple passwords. For a salt of n-bit, an attacker would need to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password, significantly increasing the computational effort required for cracking."
Explain the necessity of secure password storage and the challenges faced by defenders.,"It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised. The primary challenge for defenders is that once an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. As a defender, it is only possible to slow down these offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible, rather than completely preventing them."
"Compare and contrast hashing and encryption in the context of sensitive data protection, specifically for passwords.","Both **hashing** and **encryption** provide ways to keep sensitive data safe. However, they differ fundamentally in their function. Hashing is a **one-way function**, meaning it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. It is appropriate for password validation because even if an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim. Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted. In contrast, encryption is a **two-way function**, meaning that the original plaintext password can be retrieved if the key is available."
Describe the basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes.,"Although it is not possible to ""decrypt"" password hashes to obtain the original passwords, it is possible to ""crack"" them in some circumstances. The basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes are: first, select a password they think the victim has chosen; second, calculate the hash of that chosen password; and third, compare the calculated hash to the hash of the victim. If they match, the attacker has correctly ""cracked"" the hash and now knows the plaintext value of the password."
Analyse the methods attackers use to select candidate passwords for cracking.,"Attackers repeat the password cracking process for a large number of potential candidate passwords. Different methods can be used to select these candidate passwords, including: using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, employing **brute force** (which involves trying every possible candidate password), and utilizing dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords. These methods aim to efficiently guess the original plaintext password by generating hashes to compare against the stolen hashes."
"What factors contribute to the relative ease of password cracking for attackers, and how can this be mitigated?","The cost to an attacker for successful password cracking is relatively small, even with an enormous number of permutations, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed. This is due to the availability of high-speed hardware, such as GPUs, and cloud services with many servers for rent. To mitigate this, strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be implemented, making it effectively impossible for an attacker to crack them. It is the administrator's responsibility to select a modern hashing algorithm."
Explain how the uniqueness of salt for every user impacts an attacker's ability to crack hashes.,"The fact that a **salt** is unique for every user significantly impacts an attacker's ability to crack hashes. A **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string added to each password as part of the hashing process. Because each user's password has a distinct salt, an attacker must crack hashes one at a time, using the respective salt for each. This prevents the attacker from calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash, making cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
How does salting protect against pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups?,"Salting protects against an attacker pre-computing hashes using **rainbow tables** or database-based lookups. A **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string added to a password before hashing. Because each password has a unique salt, the hash generated for a given password will be different for every user, even if they use the same password. This means that pre-computed tables, which store hashes of common passwords, become ineffective because the attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value, which is computationally infeasible."
What is the benefit of modern hashing algorithms in relation to password salting?,"Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, automatically salt passwords. This provides a significant benefit because it means no additional steps are required when using them to ensure that passwords are properly salted. The automatic inclusion of a **salt** (a unique, randomly generated string added to a password before hashing) enhances security by making offline attacks using pre-computed hashes much less effective."
Define 'salt' in the context of password security.,"In the context of password security, a **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process. It is combined with the plaintext password before the hash function is applied, and the resulting hash of the password+salt is stored along with the salt value."
What is the primary goal when storing passwords in an application or database?,"The primary goal when storing passwords in an application or database is to ensure they are stored in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database itself is compromised. This involves using secure methods like hashing and salting to protect the integrity of user credentials."
Explain what an 'offline attack' is in the context of password hashes.,"An **offline attack** in the context of password hashes refers to an attacker's ability to attempt to crack password hashes without needing to interact with the live application or database. After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they can download these hashes and then use their own computational resources (e.g., powerful hardware) to brute force them at their leisure, without triggering any alarms or rate limits on the target system."
What type of hash algorithms should defenders prioritize to slow down offline attacks?,"To slow down offline attacks, defenders should prioritize selecting hash algorithms that are as **resource intensive** as possible. This means choosing algorithms that require significant computational power, memory, or time to compute a hash, thereby increasing the time and cost for an attacker to brute force a large number of hashes."
Can an attacker 'decrypt' a password hash to obtain the original password? Explain.,"No, an attacker cannot ""decrypt"" a password hash to obtain the original password. **Hashing** is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to reverse the process and derive the original plaintext value from the hash. While cracking is possible (guessing the original password that produces a given hash), decryption in the traditional sense is not."
What happens if an attacker obtains a hashed password? Can they log in as the victim?,"Even if an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot enter it directly into an application's password field and log in as the victim. This is because the application expects the plaintext password, which it then hashes internally for comparison. Since hashing is a one-way function, the attacker cannot retrieve the original plaintext password from the hash to use for login."
Define 'brute force' in the context of password cracking.,"**Brute force** in the context of password cracking is a method used by attackers to select candidate passwords by trying every possible combination or permutation of characters. This exhaustive approach aims to eventually guess the correct plaintext password that, when hashed, matches the stolen password hash."
How does salting specifically reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes?,"Salting reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes by adding a unique, random string (the **salt**) to each password before it is hashed. This means that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different because their salts are different. Consequently, an attacker cannot use a single pre-computed hash table (like a rainbow table) to crack multiple passwords; they would need to pre-compute hashes for every possible password-salt combination, which is computationally prohibitive."
Explain the storage mechanism for salt values in password security.,"In password security, the **salt** value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This means that when a user's password needs to be verified, the stored salt can be retrieved, combined with the entered password, and then hashed. The newly computed hash is then compared to the stored hash of password+salt to authenticate the user."
Why is it crucial for each password to have its own unique salt?,"It is crucial for each password to have its own unique **salt** because this significantly enhances security against offline attacks. A **salt** is a random string added to a password before hashing. If each password has a unique salt, it prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables (like rainbow tables) to crack multiple passwords simultaneously. Instead, the attacker must crack each hash individually, as the same password will produce different hashes when combined with different salts."
What is the significance of a salt being a 'random string'?,"The significance of a **salt** being a 'random string' is that it ensures unpredictability and uniqueness. A **salt** is a random string added to a password before hashing. This randomness makes it impossible for attackers to anticipate or pre-compute common password-salt combinations, thereby forcing them to perform individual cracking attempts for each salted hash, which drastically increases the computational effort required for large-scale attacks."
How do high-speed hardware like GPUs and cloud services impact an attacker's ability to crack passwords?,"High-speed hardware such as GPUs and cloud services with many servers for rent significantly lower the cost and increase the efficiency for an attacker to perform successful password cracking. While the number of permutations can be enormous, these resources allow attackers to process a vast number of candidate passwords and their hashes quickly, making cracking more feasible, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed."
What are 'best practices for hashing' that make password cracking effectively impossible?,"To make password cracking effectively impossible, 'best practices for hashing' involve using strong passwords in conjunction with modern hashing algorithms that are resource-intensive and automatically salt passwords. These practices ensure that even with high-speed hardware, the computational effort required to crack a password hash is prohibitively high, making it impractical for attackers."
What does it mean for a salt to be 'unique for every user' and why is this important?,"For a **salt** to be 'unique for every user' means that each individual user's password, even if identical to another user's, will be combined with a different, randomly generated string before hashing. This is important because it forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each. It prevents the attacker from calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash, thereby making cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder."
How does salting make cracking 'large numbers of hashes significantly harder'?,"Salting makes cracking 'large numbers of hashes significantly harder' because the **salt** is unique for every user. A **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string added to each password as part of the hashing process. This means an attacker cannot calculate a hash once and compare it against every stored hash. Instead, they must crack hashes one at a time, using the respective salt for each. Consequently, the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks computationally intensive and impractical."
What are 'rainbow tables' and how does salting mitigate their threat?,"**Rainbow tables** are pre-computed tables of hashes that attackers use to quickly find the original plaintext password corresponding to a given hash. Salting mitigates their threat because a **salt** (a unique, randomly generated string) is added to each password before hashing. This means that even if two users have the same password, their salted hashes will be different. Therefore, a single rainbow table cannot be used to crack multiple salted passwords, as the attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value, rendering the approach ineffective."
Analyse the security implications of hashing versus encryption for password storage.,"For password storage, hashing is the recommended approach over encryption due to distinct security implications. **Hashing** is a one-way function, meaning the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved from its hash. This is crucial because even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot use it to log in or reverse it to get the original password. **Encryption**, conversely, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved if the key is available. Storing encrypted passwords would mean that if the encryption key is compromised, all passwords could be decrypted, posing a severe security risk. Therefore, hashing provides a higher level of security for passwords by making them irreversible."
Describe the general flow of password salting as illustrated in the process.,"The general flow of password salting, as illustrated, begins with a plaintext password (e.g., ""hello""). A **salt** (a random string, e.g., ""3ab9"") is then added to this password, forming a combined string (e.g., ""hello3ab9""). This combined string is then passed through a **hash function**, which produces a fixed-size output (e.g., ""39e19b234...""). Finally, this generated hash and the original salt are stored together, ensuring that the salt is available for future password verification."
What is the core principle behind slowing down offline attacks on password hashes?,"The core principle behind slowing down offline attacks on password hashes is to make the process of guessing and verifying passwords as computationally expensive and time-consuming as possible for the attacker. This is achieved by selecting hash algorithms that are resource-intensive and by using **salting**, which forces attackers to crack hashes one at a time rather than using pre-computed tables for multiple passwords."
Why is hashing considered a 'one-way function'?,"Hashing is considered a 'one-way function' because it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process; that is, it is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value from which it was generated. The hash function takes an input and produces a fixed-size output, but there is no inverse function that can reliably reconstruct the original input from that output."
What is the key advantage of modern hashing algorithms in terms of salting implementation?,"The key advantage of modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, is that they automatically salt passwords. This means that when these algorithms are used, the process of generating and adding a unique **salt** (a random string added to a password before hashing) is handled internally by the algorithm, requiring no additional steps or manual intervention from the developer or administrator. This simplifies secure password storage and ensures best practices are followed by default."
How does salting prevent an attacker from determining if two users share the same password without cracking the hashes?,"Salting prevents an attacker from determining whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes because different salts will result in different hashes, even if the underlying passwords are identical. A **salt** is a unique, randomly generated string added to each password before hashing. Since each user's password is combined with a distinct salt, the resulting hash will be unique, making it impossible for an attacker to simply compare hashes to identify users with identical passwords."
What are the basic steps an attacker takes to crack an unsalted password hash?,"The basic steps an attacker takes to crack an unsalted password hash involve: first, selecting a password they believe the victim might have chosen; second, calculating the hash of that selected password; and third, comparing the hash they calculated to the hash of the victim. If these two hashes match, the attacker has successfully ""cracked"" the hash and discovered the plaintext value of the victim's password."
What types of candidate passwords do attackers commonly use when attempting to crack password hashes?,"Attackers commonly use several types of candidate passwords when attempting to crack password hashes. These include: lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, employing **brute force** (trying every possible candidate password systematically), and utilizing dictionaries or wordlists that contain common passwords. These methods are used to generate a large number of potential passwords whose hashes can then be compared against the target hashes."
What is the relationship between the number of hashes and cracking time when salting is used?,"When salting is used, the relationship between the number of hashes and cracking time is directly proportional. Since a unique **salt** (a unique, randomly generated string added to each password before hashing) is used for every user, an attacker cannot pre-compute hashes or use rainbow tables effectively. Instead, they must crack hashes one at a time, meaning the time required to crack a large number of hashes grows linearly with the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks significantly more time-consuming and difficult."
Summarize the key benefits of password salting for security.,"The key benefits of password salting for security include: reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes by requiring individual cracking efforts for each password; protecting against rainbow tables and database-based lookups; making it significantly harder to crack large numbers of hashes as time required grows proportionally to the number of hashes; and preventing an attacker from determining if two users have the same password without cracking the hashes, as different salts yield different hashes even for identical passwords."
Analyse the role of an administrator in ensuring robust password security.,"The administrator plays a crucial role in ensuring robust password security. It is their responsibility to select a modern hashing algorithm that incorporates best practices. This includes choosing algorithms that are resource-intensive and automatically salt passwords, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, or PBKDF2. By making informed choices about the hashing algorithm, administrators can ensure that strong passwords, even if compromised in hashed form, are effectively impossible for an attacker to crack."
How does the 'add salt' step in the illustration contribute to the overall security of password storage?,"The 'add salt' step in the illustration is fundamental to enhancing the overall security of password storage. By adding a **salt** (a random string) to the plaintext password before hashing, it ensures that the resulting hash is unique even if the original password is common or identical to another user's. This prevents attackers from using pre-computed hash tables or easily identifying users with the same password, thereby significantly reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks."
What is the implication of storing the salt value along with the hash of password+salt?,"Storing the **salt** value along with the hash of password+salt is a necessary implication of the salting process. A **salt** is a random string added to a password before hashing. When a user attempts to log in, the system needs the specific salt that was used for that user's password to re-hash the entered password and compare it to the stored hash. Storing them together ensures that the correct salt is always available for verification, while still maintaining the security benefits of salting."
Why is it important for passwords to be hashed and NOT encrypted?,"It is important for passwords to be hashed and NOT encrypted because **hashing** is a one-way function, making it impossible to retrieve the original plaintext password from its hash. This means that even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot use it to log in or reverse it. **Encryption**, on the other hand, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved if the key is available. If passwords were encrypted and the encryption key was compromised, all user passwords would be exposed, leading to a catastrophic security breach."
Analyse the impact of an n-bit salt on an attacker's pre-computation efforts.,"For a **salt** of n-bit, the attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password. A **salt** is a random string added to a password before hashing. This significantly increases the attacker's computational burden because instead of pre-computing a single hash for a given password, they must account for all 2^n possible salt values that could be combined with that password. This exponential increase in required pre-computation makes large-scale offline attacks using pre-computed tables practically infeasible."
"What is the relationship between strong passwords, modern hashing algorithms, and best practices in preventing cracking?","The relationship between strong passwords, modern hashing algorithms, and best practices is synergistic in preventing cracking. Strong passwords provide a larger search space for attackers. Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, are designed to be resource-intensive and automatically salt passwords. When these elements are combined with best practices (like unique salts for each password), they make password cracking effectively impossible for an attacker, even with high-speed hardware, by drastically increasing the time and computational cost required for any cracking attempt."
How does the 'hash function' step contribute to password security in the salting process?,"The 'hash function' step in the salting process is critical for password security because it transforms the combined password+salt into a fixed-size, irreversible string. A **hash function** is a one-way mathematical algorithm. This ensures that the original plaintext password, even when combined with the **salt**, cannot be retrieved from the stored hash. It allows for secure password verification by comparing the hash of an entered password+salt with the stored hash, without ever exposing the actual password."
What is the primary security concern that password salting aims to address?,"The primary security concern that password salting aims to address is the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes, such as those found in rainbow tables. By adding a unique **salt** (a random string) to each password before hashing, salting ensures that pre-computed tables become ineffective, forcing attackers to perform individual, resource-intensive cracking attempts for each password."
Explain why an attacker cannot log in as a victim even if they obtain the victim's hashed password.,"An attacker cannot log in as a victim even if they obtain the victim's hashed password because **hashing** is a one-way function. The application's login process requires the original plaintext password. When a user enters their password, the application hashes it internally and then compares this newly computed hash to the stored hash. Since the attacker only has the hash and cannot reverse it to get the plaintext password, they cannot provide the necessary input for the application to authenticate them."
What are the implications of an attacker acquiring stored password hashes?,"The implications of an attacker acquiring stored password hashes are significant: they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means the attacker can use their own computational resources, potentially high-speed hardware like GPUs, to repeatedly guess and hash candidate passwords, comparing them against the stolen hashes. While they cannot ""decrypt"" the original passwords, they can ""crack"" them by finding the plaintext input that produces a matching hash."
How do modern hashing algorithms simplify the implementation of password salting?,"Modern hashing algorithms, such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2, simplify the implementation of password salting by automatically handling the salting process. This means that developers and administrators do not need to manually generate, add, and store salts separately. The algorithm itself incorporates a unique, randomly generated **salt** (a random string added to a password before hashing) as part of its function, requiring no additional steps for secure password storage."
What is the main difference in functionality between hashing and encryption?,"The main difference in functionality between **hashing** and **encryption** lies in their reversibility. Hashing is a **one-way function**, meaning it is impossible to retrieve the original plaintext data from its hash. Encryption, conversely, is a **two-way function**, meaning the original plaintext data can be retrieved from the encrypted form if the correct key is available. This fundamental difference dictates their appropriate uses in data security."
Why is it important to select hash algorithms that are 'resource intensive'?,"It is important to select hash algorithms that are 'resource intensive' because this is a key strategy to slow down offline attacks. **Resource-intensive** algorithms require significant computational power, memory, or time to compute a hash. By making each hashing operation expensive, the overall time and cost for an attacker to brute force a large number of password hashes increases dramatically, making large-scale cracking attempts impractical and less appealing."
Describe the concept of 'pre-computed hashes' and how salting counters them.,"**Pre-computed hashes** refer to tables or databases that store hashes of common or likely passwords, allowing attackers to quickly look up a stolen hash and find its corresponding plaintext password without needing to compute it on the fly. Salting counters them by adding a unique, randomly generated **salt** (a random string) to each password before hashing. This means that the hash for a given password will be different for every user, rendering pre-computed tables ineffective because the attacker would need a separate table for every possible salt value, which is infeasible."
What is the role of the 'store hash and salt' step in the password salting process?,"The 'store hash and salt' step is crucial in the password salting process because it ensures that both the computed hash of the password+salt and the specific **salt** (a random string added to the password before hashing) used are preserved. This allows for future verification: when a user attempts to log in, the stored salt can be retrieved, combined with the entered password, re-hashed, and then compared against the stored hash to authenticate the user securely."
