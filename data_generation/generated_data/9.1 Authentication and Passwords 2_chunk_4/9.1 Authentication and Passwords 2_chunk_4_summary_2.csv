Provide a comprehensive summary of password salting.,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, randomly generated string, known as a ""salt,"" to a password before applying a hash function. Each password has its own distinct salt, and this salt value is stored alongside the hash of the password+salt. This process makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because an attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than pre-computing hashes for the same password or using rainbow tables. Salting also prevents an attacker from determining if two users have the same password, as different salts will result in different hashes even if the passwords are identical."
"Define what a ""salt"" is in the context of password security.","In the context of password security, a ""salt"" is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to a password before the hash function is applied. Its primary purpose is to enhance security by making pre-computed hash attacks less effective. Each password is assigned its own distinct salt, and this salt is stored along with the hash of the password+salt."
Summarise the primary purpose of password salting.,"The primary purpose of password salting is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that rely on pre-computed hashes. By adding a unique, random string (a ""salt"") to each password before hashing, salting ensures that even identical passwords will produce different hashes. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to use techniques like rainbow tables or to crack multiple hashes simultaneously, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes."
Explain the basic mechanism of how password salting works.,"Password salting works by first generating a unique, random string called a ""salt."" This salt is then added to the user's password. The combined password and salt string is then passed through a hash function to produce a hash. Finally, both the resulting hash and the salt value are stored together. This ensures that the hash generated is unique to that specific password and salt combination, making it harder to crack."
Where is the salt value stored in a password salting system?,"The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password+salt. This co-storage is essential for password verification, as the system needs to retrieve the correct salt to re-hash an entered password for comparison."
How does the size of a salt (n-bit) affect an attacker's effort to crack passwords?,"For a salt of `n`-bit, an attacker needs to pre-compute `2^n` hashes for the same password. This significantly increases the computational effort required for an attacker, as they cannot simply pre-compute a single hash for a common password and compare it against all stored hashes. Instead, they must account for the vast number of possible salt values, making the attack much more resource-intensive."
Can you summarise the key considerations behind secure password storage?,"Secure password storage is essential to prevent passwords from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised. Attackers who acquire stored password hashes are always able to brute force them offline. Therefore, defenders must select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible to slow down these offline attacks. Passwords should always be hashed, not encrypted, and strong passwords combined with modern hashing algorithms and best practices should make cracking effectively impossible. Administrators are responsible for selecting a modern hashing algorithm."
Describe the nature of offline attacks on password hashes.,"Offline attacks on password hashes occur when an attacker has acquired stored password hashes and attempts to ""brute force"" them without needing to interact with the live application or database. This means they can try a vast number of potential passwords against the hashes at their own pace, often using powerful hardware like GPUs, without triggering any security alerts on the target system. These attacks can be slowed down by using resource-intensive hash algorithms."
What is the primary strategy for slowing down offline password attacks?,"The primary strategy for slowing down offline password attacks is to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This increases the computational cost and time required for an attacker to test each potential password, making the brute-force process significantly slower and less practical."
"Explain the difference between hashing and encryption, specifically in the context of password storage.","Hashing and encryption both provide ways to keep sensitive data safe, but they differ fundamentally. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it's impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash to obtain the original plaintext value. Passwords should always be hashed, not encrypted, because hashing is appropriate for password validation without needing to store the original password. Even if an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot use it to log in as the victim. Encryption, conversely, is a two-way function, meaning the original plaintext password can be retrieved if the correct key is available. Storing encrypted passwords would allow an attacker with the key to decrypt all passwords, compromising user accounts."
"Define ""hashing"" as it applies to password security.","In password security, ""hashing"" refers to a one-way function that transforms a password into a fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash. It is impossible to ""decrypt"" a hash to obtain the original plaintext password. Hashing is used for password validation; when a user attempts to log in, their entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct."
"Define ""encryption"" and explain why it's not suitable for storing passwords.","Encryption is a two-way function, meaning that the original plaintext password can be retrieved if the correct key is available. It is not suitable for storing passwords because if an attacker obtains the encrypted passwords and the key, they could easily decrypt and access all user passwords, leading to a severe security breach. Passwords should be hashed instead, as hashing is a one-way process."
How is hashing used for password validation?,"Hashing is used for password validation by converting the user's entered password into a hash. This newly generated hash is then compared against the hash stored in the database (which was created from the original password and its salt). If the two hashes match, it confirms that the entered password is correct, without ever needing to store or retrieve the actual plaintext password."
Describe the basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes.,"To crack unsalted password hashes, an attacker follows these basic steps: First, they select a password they think the victim has chosen. Second, they calculate the hash of that selected password. Third, they compare the hash they calculated to the hash of the victim. If the hashes match, the attacker has successfully ""cracked"" the hash and now knows the plaintext value of their password. This process is repeated for a large number of potential candidate passwords."
What methods do attackers use to select candidate passwords when attempting to crack hashes?,"Attackers use several methods to select candidate passwords when attempting to crack hashes. These include using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites, employing brute force (trying every possible candidate password), and utilizing dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords."
Discuss the factors that influence the cost for an attacker to successfully crack passwords.,"The cost to an attacker for successful password cracking can be relatively small, even when the number of permutations is enormous, especially if best practices for hashing are not followed. This is primarily due to the availability of high-speed hardware, such as GPUs, and cloud services that provide many servers for rent, which can significantly accelerate the cracking process by performing calculations rapidly and in parallel."
What makes strong passwords combined with modern hashing algorithms effective against cracking?,"Strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack. Modern hashing algorithms are designed to be resource-intensive, making brute-force attacks computationally prohibitive. When combined with complex, unique passwords, the sheer number of permutations and the time required to test each one become insurmountable for attackers."
What is the administrator's responsibility regarding hashing algorithms?,"It is the administrator's responsibility to select a modern hashing algorithm for password storage. This choice is crucial for ensuring the security of stored passwords against cracking attempts, as modern algorithms incorporate features like automatic salting and are designed to be resource-intensive."
How does salting make cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder?,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the salt is unique for every user. This means an attacker has to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each, rather than calculating a single hash for a common password once and comparing it against every stored hash. Consequently, the time required for cracking grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, making large-scale attacks impractical."
How does salting protect against rainbow tables or database-based lookups?,"Salting protects against rainbow tables or database-based lookups by ensuring that even identical passwords produce different hashes. Rainbow tables are pre-computed tables of hashes for common passwords. Since each password has a unique salt, the hash generated for ""password123"" with salt ""abc"" will be different from ""password123"" with salt ""xyz."" This invalidates the effectiveness of pre-computed rainbow tables, as an attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value, which is computationally infeasible."
Explain how salting prevents an attacker from determining if two users have the same password.,"Salting prevents an attacker from determining whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because the different salts assigned to each user will result in different hashes, even if the underlying plaintext passwords are identical. An attacker cannot simply compare two stored hashes to see if they match, as the unique salts ensure distinct hash outputs for the same password."
Name some modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt passwords. When using these algorithms, no additional steps are required to implement salting, as it is an inherent part of their design."
Summarise the introduction to password storage provided.,"The introduction to password storage emphasizes the critical need to store passwords in a manner that prevents attackers from obtaining them, even if the underlying application or database is compromised. It highlights that once attackers acquire stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. Therefore, the defender's strategy is to slow down these offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible."
Explain why passwords should be hashed and not encrypted for storage.,"Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted, for storage because hashing is a one-way function, meaning the original plaintext password cannot be retrieved from its hash. This is ideal for password validation, as only a comparison of hashes is needed. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext password to be retrieved if the encryption key is known. If an attacker obtains encrypted passwords and the key, all passwords would be compromised, whereas with hashing, the original passwords remain unknown."
"What is a key benefit of using hashing for password security, even if an attacker obtains the hashed password?","A key benefit of using hashing for password security is that even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot enter it directly into an application's password field and log in as the victim. This is because the application expects a plaintext password to hash and compare, not a pre-hashed value. The attacker would still need to ""crack"" the hash to find the original plaintext password."
"Define ""brute force"" in the context of cracking password hashes.","In the context of cracking password hashes, ""brute force"" refers to an attack method where an attacker systematically tries every possible candidate password until the correct one is found. This involves generating hashes for all possible combinations of characters and comparing them against the target hash, often performed offline after acquiring stored hashes."
How do GPUs contribute to password cracking?,"GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) contribute to password cracking by providing high-speed hardware capabilities. Their parallel processing architecture makes them highly efficient at performing the repetitive calculations required for hashing, thereby significantly accelerating the process of trying a large number of potential candidate passwords in a brute-force attack."
How do cloud services facilitate password cracking for attackers?,"Cloud services facilitate password cracking for attackers by offering access to many servers for rent. This allows attackers to leverage significant computational power on demand, scaling up their cracking efforts without needing to invest in and maintain their own extensive hardware infrastructure. This reduces the overall cost and effort for successful password cracking."
"Why is it impossible to ""decrypt"" a password hash?","It is impossible to ""decrypt"" a password hash because hashing is a one-way function. This means the process of transforming the original plaintext password into a hash is irreversible. There is no mathematical operation or key that can be applied to a hash to recover the original plaintext value."
"If an attacker obtains a hashed password, what can they *not* do with it directly?","If an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot directly enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim. The application expects a plaintext password, which it then hashes and compares to the stored hash. The attacker would first need to ""crack"" the hash to discover the original plaintext password."
"Describe the ""add salt"" step shown in the password salting illustration.","The ""add salt"" step in the password salting illustration depicts the process where a unique, random string (the ""salt"") is combined with the original plaintext password (e.g., ""hello""). This combination results in a new, longer string (e.g., ""hello3ab9""), which then proceeds to the hashing function."
"Explain the ""hash function"" step in the password salting illustration.","The ""hash function"" step in the password salting illustration shows the combined password and salt string (e.g., ""hello3ab9"") being processed by a cryptographic hash function. This function takes the input and produces a fixed-size, seemingly random output, which is the hash (e.g., ""39e19b234...""). This hash is a one-way representation of the input."
"What does the ""store hash and salt"" step signify in the password salting illustration?","The ""store hash and salt"" step in the password salting illustration signifies that after the hash function has been applied to the password+salt combination, both the resulting hash (e.g., ""39e19b234..."") and the unique salt value (e.g., ""3ab9"") are saved together. This co-storage is crucial for later password verification, as the salt is needed to re-hash an entered password for comparison."
Why is it important that each password has its own unique salt?,"It is important that each password has its own unique salt because this prevents attackers from using pre-computed hashes (like rainbow tables) or from efficiently cracking multiple passwords simultaneously. If all passwords shared the same salt, an attacker could pre-compute hashes for common passwords with that single salt and quickly compromise many accounts. A unique salt for each password forces the attacker to perform individual cracking attempts for every single password, significantly increasing the effort."
"What is meant by ""a salt is just a random string""?","When it is stated that ""a salt is just a random string,"" it means that the salt is a sequence of characters generated unpredictably and without any discernible pattern. This randomness is crucial for its security function, as it makes it impossible for an attacker to guess or predict the salt value, thereby ensuring the uniqueness of each password's hash and preventing pre-computation attacks."
Explain how adding a salt to a password reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes.,"Adding a salt to a password reduces the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes by ensuring that even if two users have the same password, their stored hashes will be different due to their unique salts. This invalidates the use of rainbow tables, which are pre-computed tables of hashes, because an attacker would need a separate rainbow table for every possible salt value. Instead, the attacker is forced to compute hashes individually for each password-salt combination, dramatically increasing the computational effort and time required."
"Define ""pre-computed hashes"" in the context of password attacks.","""Pre-computed hashes"" refer to a collection of hash values that an attacker has calculated in advance for a large number of common or likely passwords. These are often stored in structures like rainbow tables. Attackers use them in offline attacks by comparing a stolen password hash against this pre-computed database to quickly find a match and reveal the original plaintext password, without needing to perform the hashing calculation in real-time for each attempt."
"What is the significance of selecting ""resource intensive"" hash algorithms for password storage?","The significance of selecting ""resource intensive"" hash algorithms for password storage is that they are designed to require substantial computational power and time to execute. This characteristic directly slows down offline attacks, such as brute-force attempts, by making it much more expensive and time-consuming for an attacker to calculate hashes for a large number of candidate passwords. It increases the ""work factor"" for cracking, thereby enhancing security."
"What does it mean for an ""application or database"" to be ""compromised"" in the context of password security?","For an ""application or database"" to be ""compromised"" in the context of password security means that an attacker has gained unauthorized access to it. This access allows them to obtain sensitive data, including stored password hashes, which they can then attempt to crack offline."
Explain why hashing is considered appropriate for password validation.,"Hashing is considered appropriate for password validation because it allows a system to verify a user's identity without ever needing to store or know their actual plaintext password. When a user enters a password, the system hashes it and compares the result to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct. This one-way process ensures that even if the stored hashes are compromised, the original passwords remain unknown, enhancing security."
"Define ""plaintext value"" in the context of passwords.","The ""plaintext value"" of a password refers to the original, unencrypted, and unhashed form of the password as a human user would type or remember it. It is the readable and usable form of the password before any cryptographic transformations are applied."
"What are ""dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords"" used by attackers?","""Dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords"" are pre-compiled lists of frequently used passwords, common words, phrases, and variations that attackers use as candidate passwords in their cracking attempts. These lists are often derived from previous data breaches or common password patterns, allowing attackers to efficiently test a high probability set of passwords against stolen hashes."
Summarise how salting makes it impossible to determine if two users have the same password.,"Salting makes it impossible to determine if two users have the same password without cracking the hashes because each password is combined with a unique salt before hashing. This means that even if two users choose the exact same password, the different salts will cause their respective hashes to be entirely different. An attacker cannot simply compare the stored hash values to identify duplicate passwords, as the unique salts ensure distinct hash outputs for the same password."
"What is the benefit of modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salting passwords?","The benefit of modern hashing algorithms like Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salting passwords is that it simplifies the implementation of secure password storage. Administrators do not need to perform additional steps to generate and manage salts manually, as salting is an inherent and automatic part of these algorithms' design, ensuring that best practices are followed by default and reducing the chance of implementation errors."
What is the overall goal of implementing password salting?,"The overall goal of implementing password salting is to significantly enhance the security of stored passwords by making offline attacks, particularly those relying on pre-computed hashes or brute-force methods, much less effective and more computationally expensive for attackers. It ensures that each password's hash is unique, even for identical passwords, thereby protecting against large-scale cracking efforts and preventing the detection of duplicate passwords."
"Why is it essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised?","It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database is compromised, because once an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. Preventing access to the hashes themselves is the first line of defense, and even if that fails, the storage method should make cracking as difficult and time-consuming as possible to protect user accounts."
"What does it mean for strong passwords with modern hashing to be ""effectively impossible for an attacker to crack""?","For strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and best practices to be ""effectively impossible for an attacker to crack"" means that the computational resources and time required to successfully guess or brute-force the password would be so immense as to be practically unfeasible within any reasonable timeframe, even with advanced hardware and cloud services. While theoretically possible, the effort becomes prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for the attacker."
"What is the consequence if best practices for hashing are *not* followed, even with high-speed hardware?","If best practices for hashing are not followed, even with high-speed hardware such as GPUs and cloud services, the cost to an attacker to do successful password cracking can be relatively small. This means that despite the attacker's significant computational resources, poor hashing practices make it easier and cheaper for them to compromise passwords, undermining the security measures in place."
How does salting specifically protect against database-based lookups for cracking passwords?,"Salting specifically protects against database-based lookups by ensuring that each password's hash is unique due to the unique salt associated with it. This prevents an attacker from creating a general database of common password hashes and then simply looking up stolen hashes in that database to find matches. Each stolen hash would require an individual lookup or cracking attempt with its specific salt, rendering a general lookup database ineffective and forcing more intensive, individual cracking efforts."
"Summarise the key difference between a one-way function and a two-way function in cryptography, as described in the document.","The key difference between a one-way function and a two-way function in cryptography, as described, is that a one-way function (like hashing) is irreversible; it is impossible to ""decrypt"" its output to obtain the original input. A two-way function (like encryption), conversely, is reversible; the original plaintext can be retrieved from its output if the correct key is available. For password storage, one-way hashing is preferred to prevent retrieval of plaintext passwords."
