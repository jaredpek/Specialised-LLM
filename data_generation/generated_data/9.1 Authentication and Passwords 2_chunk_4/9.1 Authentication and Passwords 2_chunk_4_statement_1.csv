Define the concept of password salting.,"Password salting is a technique used to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes. It involves adding a unique, randomly generated string, known as a 'salt', to a password before applying the hash function. The salt value is then stored along with the hash of the password and salt."
What is the primary purpose of password salting?,"The primary purpose of password salting is to reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks that utilize pre-computed hashes. By adding a unique salt to each password before hashing, it makes it significantly harder for attackers to use methods like rainbow tables or brute-force attacks against multiple hashes simultaneously."
Explain what a 'salt' is in the context of password security.,"In the context of password security, a 'salt' is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to a password before the hash function is applied. Each password has its own distinct salt, and this salt value is stored alongside the resulting hash of the password combined with the salt."
How is the salt value stored in a password salting system?,"In a password salting system, the salt value is stored along with the hash of the password combined with the salt. This allows the system to retrieve the correct salt when validating a user's password."
Describe the computational effort an attacker needs for a salt of 'n' bits.,"For a salt of 'n' bits, an attacker needs to pre-compute 2^n hashes for the same password. This significantly increases the computational effort required for cracking, as they cannot simply pre-compute hashes for common passwords once."
Why is it important for each password to have its own unique salt?,"It is important for each password to have its own unique salt because this forces an attacker to crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once and comparing it against every stored hash. This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes. Additionally, it prevents determining if two users have the same password, as different salts will result in different hashes even if the passwords are identical."
What is the essential goal when storing passwords?,"The essential goal when storing passwords is to do so in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application or database where they are stored is compromised."
What can attackers do after acquiring stored password hashes?,"After an attacker has acquired stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means they can attempt to guess the original passwords without needing to interact with the compromised system."
"As a defender, what is the primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks?","As a defender, the primary strategy to mitigate offline password attacks is to slow them down by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This increases the time and computational power an attacker needs to crack passwords."
How do hashing and encryption both contribute to keeping sensitive data safe?,"Both hashing and encryption provide ways to keep sensitive data safe. Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, making it difficult to reverse, while encryption scrambles data in a way that can be reversed with a key. Both methods aim to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information."
"Should passwords be hashed or encrypted for storage, and why?","Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted, for storage. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to \""decrypt\"" a hash and obtain the original plaintext value. This makes it appropriate for password validation, as even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim. In contrast, encryption is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext password to be retrieved if the key is known, which poses a security risk."
Define 'hashing' in the context of password security.,"In the context of password security, 'hashing' is a one-way function. This means that once a password has been hashed, it is impossible to \""decrypt\"" the hash and obtain the original plaintext value of the password. Hashing is appropriate for password validation because it allows the system to verify a user's password without ever storing or knowing the actual plaintext password."
Define 'encryption' and explain how it differs from hashing.,"Encryption is a two-way function, meaning that the original plaintext data can be retrieved if the correct key is available. This differs from hashing, which is a one-way function where it is impossible to obtain the original plaintext value from the hash. While both keep sensitive data safe, encryption is reversible, whereas hashing is not."
Explain why an attacker who obtains a hashed password cannot use it to log in as the victim.,"An attacker who obtains a hashed password cannot use it to log in as the victim because hashing is a one-way function. The application's password field expects the original plaintext password, which is then hashed internally for comparison. Since the attacker only has the hash and cannot reverse it to get the plaintext password, they cannot provide the necessary input to log in."
Is it possible to 'decrypt' password hashes to obtain original passwords?,"No, it is not possible to \""decrypt\"" password hashes to obtain the original passwords. Hashing is a one-way function, by definition, which means there is no mathematical process to reverse a hash back to its original plaintext value. However, it is possible to \""crack\"" hashes in some circumstances, which involves guessing the original password and comparing its hash to the stored hash."
Outline the basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes.,"The basic steps an attacker takes to crack unsalted password hashes are:\n1. Select a password they think the victim has chosen (e.g., 'password1!').\n2. Calculate the hash of that selected password.\n3. Compare the hash they calculated to the hash of the victim's password.\n4. If the hashes match, they have correctly \""cracked\"" the hash and now know the plaintext value of the victim's password."
What methods do attackers use to select candidate passwords when attempting to crack hashes?,"Attackers use several methods to select candidate passwords when attempting to crack hashes. These include:\n*   Using lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites.\n*   Employing brute force, which involves trying every possible candidate password systematically.\n*   Utilizing dictionaries or wordlists of common passwords."
"Discuss the cost implications for an attacker performing password cracking, considering modern hardware.","While the number of password permutations can be enormous, the cost to an attacker for successful password cracking is relatively small. This is especially true when best practices for hashing are not followed, and attackers leverage high-speed hardware such as GPUs and cloud services with many servers for rent."
What measures can make password cracking effectively impossible for an attacker?,Password cracking can be made effectively impossible for an attacker by using strong passwords stored with modern hashing algorithms and by consistently applying hashing best practices. This combination significantly increases the computational resources and time required for an attacker to succeed.
What is an administrator's key responsibility regarding hashing algorithms for password security?,An administrator's key responsibility regarding hashing algorithms for password security is to select a modern hashing algorithm. This ensures that passwords are stored using up-to-date and robust security practices.
How does salting protect against rainbow tables?,"Salting protects against rainbow tables by preventing an attacker from pre-computing hashes. Rainbow tables are pre-computed lists of hashes for common passwords. Since salting adds a unique, random string to each password before hashing, the resulting hashes are unique even for identical passwords, rendering pre-computed rainbow tables ineffective."
Name some modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords.,"Modern hashing algorithms that automatically salt passwords include Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2. When using these algorithms, no additional steps are required to implement salting, as it is handled automatically."
How does salting prevent an attacker from determining if two users have the same password?,"Salting prevents an attacker from determining whether two users have the same password without cracking the hashes. This is because different salts will result in different hashes, even if the underlying plaintext passwords are identical. Therefore, an attacker cannot simply compare hashes to identify duplicate passwords across accounts."
Describe the process of password salting as illustrated in the provided diagram.,"As illustrated, the password salting process begins with a plaintext password, for example, 'hello'. A 'salt' is then added to this password, resulting in a combined string like 'hello3ab9'. This combined string is then passed through a 'hash function', which produces a unique hash value, such as '39e19b234...'. Finally, both the generated hash and the salt are stored together."
What are 'pre-computed hashes' in the context of password attacks?,"In the context of password attacks, 'pre-computed hashes' refer to lists of hash values that attackers have already calculated for a large number of common or likely passwords. These are used in offline attacks to quickly compare against stolen password hashes without needing to calculate each hash in real-time, making attacks like rainbow table lookups much faster."
Why are hash algorithms chosen to be resource intensive?,"It is recommended to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible to slow down offline attacks. By requiring significant computational resources (like CPU time or memory) to compute a single hash, these algorithms make it much more expensive and time-consuming for attackers to brute force or crack a large number of password hashes, even with powerful hardware."
Define 'brute force' in the context of password cracking.,"In the context of password cracking, 'brute force' is a method where an attacker attempts to guess a password by systematically trying every possible candidate password. This can involve trying all combinations of characters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password's hash matches the target hash."
Explain what 'dictionaries or wordlists' are used for in password cracking.,"In password cracking, 'dictionaries or wordlists' are collections of common passwords, words, phrases, or patterns that attackers use as candidate passwords. Instead of trying every possible character combination (brute force), attackers can quickly test these known weak or frequently used passwords against stolen hashes, as many users choose simple or common passwords."
How does salting specifically make cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder?,"Salting makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder because the salt is unique for every user. This means an attacker cannot compute a single hash for a common password and compare it against all stored hashes. Instead, they have to crack hashes one at a time, using the respective unique salt for each, which causes the time required to grow in direct proportion to the number of hashes they are trying to crack."
"What is the difference between \""decrypting\"" and \""cracking\"" a password hash?","The terms \""decrypting\"" and \""cracking\"" a password hash refer to different concepts. \""Decrypting\"" a hash is impossible because hashing is a one-way function; there's no method to reverse a hash to its original plaintext. \""Cracking\"" a hash, however, is possible in some circumstances. It involves guessing a potential plaintext password, hashing that guess, and then comparing the resulting hash to the target hash. If they match, the original password has been \""cracked\"" or discovered through trial and error, not decryption."
Why is password storage critical even if the database is compromised?,"It is essential to store passwords securely even if the application or database is compromised because an attacker might gain access to the stored password hashes. If these hashes are not stored securely (e.g., unsalted or with weak algorithms), the attacker can then brute force or crack them offline to obtain the original plaintext passwords, leading to further security breaches."
What is the role of a hash function in password salting?,"In the password salting process, the hash function's role is to take the combined string of the password and its unique salt, and transform it into a fixed-size, one-way hash value. This hash value is then stored, and it is used for future password validation by hashing the user's input password with the stored salt and comparing the resulting hash."
Can an attacker log in with a stolen hashed password?,"No, even if an attacker obtains a hashed password, they cannot enter it directly into an application's password field and log in as the victim. This is because the application expects the original plaintext password, which it then hashes internally for comparison with the stored hash. Since hashing is a one-way function, the attacker cannot reverse the hash to get the plaintext password required for login."
"What are \""compromised sites\"" in the context of password cracking?","In password cracking, \""lists of passwords obtained from other compromised sites\"" refers to databases of usernames and passwords that have been stolen from other websites or services that suffered data breaches. Attackers collect these lists and use them as candidate passwords, assuming that users often reuse the same passwords across multiple online accounts."
How do modern hashing algorithms simplify the process of salting passwords?,"Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 simplify the process of salting passwords by automatically handling the salting mechanism. This means that no additional manual steps are required from the developer or administrator to generate, add, and store salts when using these algorithms, as salting is an inherent part of their design."
What is the main benefit of salting against offline attacks?,"The main benefit of password salting in reducing the effectiveness of offline attacks is that it prevents attackers from using pre-computed hashes, such as those found in rainbow tables. By adding a unique, random salt to each password before hashing, every resulting hash is unique, even for identical passwords, forcing attackers to compute hashes individually for each target."
Why is it important to use strong passwords in conjunction with modern hashing?,"It is important to use strong passwords in conjunction with modern hashing algorithms and best practices because this combination makes password cracking effectively impossible for an attacker. While modern hashing algorithms and salting increase the computational cost of cracking, a strong password (e.g., long, complex, unique) further expands the search space, making brute-force attacks prohibitively time-consuming even with powerful hardware."
What is the general topic covered by the 'Password Storage Cheat Sheet'?,"The 'Password Storage Cheat Sheet' generally covers essential guidelines and concepts for securely storing passwords. It emphasizes preventing passwords from being obtained by attackers, slowing down offline attacks, and differentiating between hashing and encryption for password management."
What is the implication of an attacker acquiring stored password hashes?,The immediate implication if an attacker acquires stored password hashes is that they are always able to brute force these hashes offline. This means they can dedicate computational resources to systematically guess the original passwords without needing further access to the compromised system.
How does salting affect the time required for an attacker to crack a large number of hashes?,"Salting significantly increases the time required for an attacker to crack a large number of hashes. Because each password has a unique salt, the attacker must crack hashes one at a time using the respective salt. This means the time required grows in direct proportion to the number of hashes, rather than allowing for parallel or pre-computed attacks across many hashes simultaneously."
What is the primary functional difference between hashing and encryption?,"The primary functional difference between hashing and encryption lies in their reversibility. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to reverse a hash to obtain the original plaintext value. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way function, allowing the original plaintext to be retrieved if the correct key is available."
Explain the security rationale behind hashing passwords instead of encrypting them.,"Passwords are hashed instead of encrypted primarily because hashing is a one-way function. This means that even if an attacker gains access to the hashed passwords, they cannot reverse the hash to obtain the original plaintext passwords. This prevents them from logging in as the victim or using those passwords on other services. Encrypting passwords would mean that with the right key, the original plaintext passwords could be retrieved, posing a significant security risk if the key is compromised."
What kind of hardware do attackers typically use to speed up password cracking?,"Attackers typically use high-speed hardware such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and cloud services with many servers for rent to speed up password cracking. These resources provide significant computational power, making it relatively inexpensive for attackers to perform successful cracking, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed."
What is the significance of the 'add salt' step shown in the password salting illustration?,"The 'add salt' step in the password salting illustration signifies the crucial action of combining a unique, randomly generated string (the salt) with the plaintext password before it undergoes the hashing process. This step is fundamental to enhancing security by ensuring that even identical passwords will produce different hashes due to their unique salts, thereby mitigating offline attacks like rainbow table lookups."
"According to the illustration, what is the final step in the password salting process?","According to the illustration, the final step in the password salting process is to 'store hash and salt'. This means that both the resulting hash value (derived from the password combined with the salt) and the unique salt itself are saved together, allowing for proper validation during future login attempts."
How does salting prevent database-based lookups for cracking?,"Salting protects against database-based lookups for cracking passwords by ensuring that each password has a unique salt. This means an attacker cannot create a database of pre-computed hashes for common passwords and then simply look up stolen hashes in that database. Each stolen hash would require a unique calculation based on its specific salt, rendering general lookup tables ineffective."
What is the general principle a defender should follow to slow down offline password attacks?,"The general principle a defender should follow to slow down offline password attacks is to select hash algorithms that are as resource-intensive as possible. This increases the computational time and effort required for an attacker to brute force or crack password hashes, making the attack less feasible."
Why is hashing considered appropriate for password validation?,"Hashing is considered appropriate for password validation because it allows a system to verify a user's password without ever needing to store or know the actual plaintext password. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is hashed with the stored salt, and the resulting hash is compared to the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct, all without exposing the original password."
What happens if best practices for hashing are not followed?,"If best practices for hashing are not followed, the cost to an attacker to do successful password cracking becomes relatively small, even with high-speed hardware like GPUs and cloud services. This significantly increases the risk of passwords being compromised through offline attacks."
What is the overall message of the 'Password Storage Cheat Sheet' regarding password security?,"The overall message of the 'Password Storage Cheat Sheet' regarding password security is that it is paramount to store passwords in a manner that protects them from attackers, even if the underlying system is compromised. This involves using one-way hashing functions, implementing salting (preferably with modern algorithms that do so automatically), and selecting resource-intensive algorithms to slow down offline attacks, ultimately aiming to make password cracking effectively impossible."
