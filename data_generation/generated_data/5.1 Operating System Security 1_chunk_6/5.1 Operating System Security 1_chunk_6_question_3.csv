What is a system call?,"A system call is an interface that enables a user-level process to request specific functions or services from the kernel level. These services can include process control, file management, and device management."
What types of services can a user-level process request from the kernel level via a system call?,"A user-level process can request various functions or services from the kernel level through a system call. These services typically include process control, file management, and device management."
How is a system call issued by a user process?,"A user process issues a system call by passing the index of the desired system call and its parameters using a specific API. This API typically takes the form `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`, where `SYS_call` is the index of the system call and `arg1`, `arg2`, etc., are its parameters. The system uses a system call table, which is a table of pointers in the kernel region, to locate the different system call functions."
What is the purpose of a system call table?,"The system call table is a crucial component in the kernel region that serves as a table of pointers. Its purpose is to point to different system call functions, allowing the operating system to efficiently locate and execute the appropriate kernel-level service requested by a user process."
Where is the system call table located?,The system call table is located in the kernel region of the operating system's memory.
What information does a user process pass when issuing a system call using the `syscall` API?,"When issuing a system call using the `syscall` API, a user process passes two main pieces of information: the index of the specific system call it wishes to invoke (represented as `SYS_call` in the API) and any necessary parameters for that system call (represented as `arg1`, `arg2`, etc.)."
Provide the API syntax for issuing a system call.,"The API syntax for issuing a system call is `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`. Here, `SYS_call` represents the index of the specific system call function to be invoked, and `arg1`, `arg2`, and subsequent arguments are the parameters required by that system call function."
"What does the `syscall` API function `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` represent?","The `syscall` API function `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` represents the mechanism by which a user-level process requests a specific kernel-level service. `SYS_call` is the unique index identifying the desired system call function, and `arg1`, `arg2`, and subsequent arguments are the input parameters passed to that kernel function."
Can a user-level process directly access kernel-level functions?,"No, a user-level process cannot directly access kernel-level functions. Instead, it must use a system call, which acts as an interface, to request functions or services from the kernel level."
What is the role of the kernel level in handling system calls?,"The kernel level's role in handling system calls is to provide the actual functions and services that user-level processes request. When a system call is issued, the kernel executes the corresponding kernel-level function, which can involve process control, file management, or device management, among other tasks."
What is a rootkit?,"A rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. Once it has root privileges, it can perform any actions on the system without undergoing security checks, including inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code and hiding its own existence."
What privileges does a rootkit obtain?,A rootkit obtains root privileges. Root privileges grant the ability to perform any actions on the system without being subjected to security checks.
What actions can a root user perform on a system?,"A root user, which a rootkit impersonates or gains control over, can perform any actions on the system without going through security checks. This includes inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path and hiding its existence (e.g., malicious processes, files, network sockets) from detection."
How does a rootkit compromise a computer?,"A rootkit compromises a computer by obtaining root privileges. With these privileges, it can insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path and hide its existence, such as malicious processes, files, or network sockets, to avoid detection."
What are the ways a rootkit can hide its existence?,"A rootkit can hide its existence by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets from being detected by the system or security software."
How can an attacker gain root privileges to deploy a rootkit?,An attacker can gain root privileges to deploy a rootkit by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software stack. Examples of such vulnerabilities include buffer overflows and format string bugs.
What are some examples of vulnerabilities in the software stack that attackers exploit?,Some common examples of vulnerabilities in the software stack that attackers exploit to gain root privileges include buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.
What is the primary goal of a rootkit?,The primary goal of a rootkit is to obtain root privileges on a computer to compromise it. This allows the rootkit to execute malicious code and hide its presence on the system.
Does a root user undergo security checks?,"No, a root user does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions on the system."
Can a rootkit insert and execute arbitrary malicious code?,"Yes, a rootkit can insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path once it has obtained root privileges."
How does a rootkit hijack the system-call table?,A rootkit hijacks the system-call table by changing the pointers of certain entries within it. This redirection causes other processes that call these system calls to execute the attacker's malicious code instead of the legitimate system function.
What is the consequence of a rootkit changing pointers in the system-call table?,The consequence of a rootkit changing pointers in the system-call table is that any other processes calling those specific system calls will inadvertently execute the attacker's malicious code instead of the intended legitimate system function.
Provide an example of a system call that can be hijacked by a rootkit.,An example of a system call that can be hijacked by a rootkit is `syscall_open`. This system call is typically used by commands like `ps` to display running processes.
What is the `ps` command used for in the context of `syscall_open`?,"In the context of `syscall_open`, the `ps` command is mentioned as an example of a utility that uses `syscall_open` to display running processes. This illustrates how hijacking `syscall_open` can affect common system utilities."
How does a rootkit redirect `syscall_open`?,"A rootkit redirects `syscall_open` by changing its pointer in the system-call table to point to a new, malicious function, such as `new_syscall_open`. This means that whenever `syscall_open` is invoked, `new_syscall_open` is executed instead."
What happens when `new_syscall_open` is called and the object to be opened matches a malicious name?,"When `new_syscall_open` is called and the object to be opened matches a malicious name (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"", ""reverse_shell""), the function returns `NULL`. This action effectively hides the existence of the malicious object from the requesting process."
What happens when `new_syscall_open` is called and the object to be opened does *not* match a malicious name?,"When `new_syscall_open` is called and the object to be opened does *not* match a malicious name, the function proceeds to call the normal, original `old_syscall_open`. This ensures that legitimate system operations continue to function correctly, preventing system instability or detection."
What is `old_syscall_open` in the context of a hijacked system call?,"In the context of a hijacked system call, `old_syscall_open` refers to the original, legitimate `syscall_open` function. The rootkit saves the pointer to this original function before redirecting `syscall_open` to its malicious `new_syscall_open`, allowing `new_syscall_open` to call the original function for non-malicious operations."
What is the purpose of `malicious_object_name` in the provided code example?,"The purpose of `malicious_object_name` in the provided code example is to store a list of names (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"", ""reverse_shell"") that the rootkit wants to hide. When `new_syscall_open` is invoked, it checks if the object being opened matches any of these names to determine whether to hide it or call the original system call."
Explain the role of `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` in the hijacking process.,"In the hijacking process, `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` represents the entry in the system-call table corresponding to the `open` system call. The rootkit first saves the original pointer from `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` into `old_syscall_open` and then overwrites `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` with the pointer to `new_syscall_open()`, effectively redirecting the `open` system call."
"Besides hijacking the system-call table, what is another way a rootkit can compromise system call functions?","Besides hijacking the system-call table, a rootkit can also directly change the system call function itself. This involves modifying the actual code of the system call function in memory."
How does a rootkit directly change a system call function?,"A rootkit directly changes a system call function by replacing the initial bytes of the legitimate system call with a jump instruction to a malicious function. For example, it can replace the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with a jump to `malicious_open`."
What is the specific mechanism used to replace the beginning of `syscall_open`?,"The specific mechanism used to replace the beginning of `syscall_open` is to overwrite its first 7 bytes with a jump instruction that redirects execution to a malicious function, such as `malicious_open`. This is achieved by constructing `new_syscall_code` containing the jump instruction and then using `memncpy` to copy it into the `syscall_open`'s memory location."
What is the purpose of replacing the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with a jump to `malicious_open`?,"The purpose of replacing the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with a jump to `malicious_open` is to divert the execution flow. When `syscall_open` is called, it will immediately jump to `malicious_open`, allowing the rootkit to execute its malicious code before potentially restoring and calling the original system call."
What does the faked system call do after issuing the malicious function?,"After issuing the malicious function, the faked system call restores the original system call's initial bytes and then calls the correct, original system call. This ensures that the system's normal functionality is maintained after the malicious action has been performed."
What is `malicious_open` in this context?,"In this context, `malicious_open` is a function implemented by the rootkit. It is the target of the jump instruction that replaces the beginning of the original `syscall_open`. This function contains the malicious code that the rootkit intends to execute."
How does the rootkit ensure the original system call functionality is preserved after its malicious action?,"The rootkit ensures the original system call functionality is preserved by first saving the initial bytes of the original system call (e.g., `syscall_open`) before overwriting them. After its `malicious_function()` is executed, it restores these saved original bytes to `syscall_open` and then calls the now-restored original `syscall_open` function."
What is `old_syscall_code` used for in the provided code example?,"`old_syscall_code` is a buffer used to store the first 7 bytes of the original `syscall_open` function. This is done before `syscall_open` is modified with a jump instruction to `malicious_open`. Later, these saved bytes are used to restore `syscall_open` to its original state before calling it."
What is `new_syscall_code` in the context of compromising system call functions?,"`new_syscall_code` is a byte array containing the machine code for a jump instruction. This instruction is designed to redirect execution from the beginning of the original system call function (e.g., `syscall_open`) to the rootkit's `malicious_open` function. It typically includes an instruction like `movl %pt, %ebp` followed by `jmp %ebp`."
Explain the `memncpy` function's role in this compromise technique.,"The `memncpy` function plays a critical role in this compromise technique by copying specific byte sequences in memory. It is used to: 1) save the initial bytes of the original `syscall_open` into `old_syscall_code`, 2) copy the address of `malicious_open` into a temporary buffer `pt`, and 3) overwrite the initial bytes of `syscall_open` with the `new_syscall_code` (which contains the jump instruction to `malicious_open`). It is also used to restore the original `syscall_open` code later."
Compare and contrast hijacking the system-call table versus directly changing system call functions.,"Hijacking the system-call table involves changing pointers within the table so that an entry for a legitimate system call points to a malicious function. This redirection occurs at the table lookup level. Directly changing system call functions, on the other hand, involves modifying the actual machine code of the system call function itself, typically by replacing its initial bytes with a jump instruction to a malicious function. While both methods achieve redirection to attacker's code, the former modifies a pointer in a table, and the latter modifies the function's executable code directly."
What are the two main methods described for a rootkit to compromise system calls?,"The two main methods described for a rootkit to compromise system calls are: 1) Hijacking the system-call table by changing pointers of certain entries to point to attacker's code, and 2) Directly changing the system call function by replacing its initial bytes with a jump instruction to a malicious function."
Why is it important for a rootkit to hide its existence?,"It is important for a rootkit to hide its existence to avoid detection by system administrators or security software. By concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets, the rootkit can maintain its presence and malicious activities on the compromised system for longer periods without being discovered and removed."
What is the significance of root privileges for a rootkit?,"Root privileges are highly significant for a rootkit because they allow the malware to bypass all security checks and perform any action on the system. This level of access is essential for inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code, modifying critical system components like the system-call table, and effectively hiding its presence from detection."
How does a rootkit maintain system functionality while performing malicious actions when compromising system call functions?,"When compromising system call functions, a rootkit maintains system functionality by saving the original system call's code before modifying it. After executing its malicious function, it restores the original system call's code and then calls the legitimate system call. This ensures that normal system operations can proceed as expected, reducing the chances of detection due to system instability."
What is the overall objective of a rootkit's actions on system calls?,"The overall objective of a rootkit's actions on system calls is to gain control over fundamental system operations. By intercepting and modifying system calls, the rootkit can execute its own malicious code, hide its presence (e.g., files, processes), and manipulate system behavior without being detected, all while maintaining the illusion of normal system functionality."
What is the relationship between user-level processes and the kernel level in the context of system calls?,"In the context of system calls, user-level processes and the kernel level have a client-server relationship. User-level processes act as clients, requesting functions or services, while the kernel level acts as the server, providing those services. System calls serve as the interface that facilitates these requests and responses, allowing user processes to access privileged kernel resources and operations indirectly."
What kind of information is stored in the system call table?,"The system call table stores a table of pointers. These pointers are located in the kernel region and point to different system call functions, allowing the system to map a system call index to its corresponding kernel-level implementation."
What is the role of `__NR_open` in the context of system call table manipulation?,"`__NR_open` is a symbolic constant that represents the numerical index for the `open` system call within the system-call table. In the context of system call table manipulation, it is used as an index to access the specific entry in the `syscall_addr` array (which represents the system-call table) that corresponds to the `open` function, allowing its pointer to be read or modified."
How does a rootkit ensure persistence or continued malicious activity through system call manipulation?,"A rootkit ensures persistence or continued malicious activity through system call manipulation by redirecting or modifying system calls that are frequently used by other processes. By doing so, any legitimate process attempting to use these system calls will inadvertently trigger the rootkit's malicious code, allowing it to maintain control, hide its components, or execute further malicious actions whenever those system calls are invoked."
