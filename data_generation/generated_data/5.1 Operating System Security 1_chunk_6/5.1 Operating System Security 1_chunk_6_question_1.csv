What is a system call?,"A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. These services can include process control, file management, and device management."
How does a user process issue a system call?,"A user process issues a system call by using the `syscall()` API. This API takes the index of the desired system call (represented by `SYS_call`) and any necessary parameters (`arg1`, `arg2`, etc.) as input. The system call index is used to look up the corresponding function pointer in the system call table, which is a table of pointers located in the kernel region that points to different system call functions."
What is the system call table?,"The system call table is a data structure located in the kernel region of memory. It contains pointers to various system call functions. When a user process makes a system call, the index provided to the `syscall()` API is used to find the correct function pointer within this table, which then allows the kernel to execute the requested service."
What are some examples of services provided by system calls?,"System calls provide access to essential operating system services, including process control, file management, and device management."
What is a rootkit?,"A rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. Once it has root privileges, a root user can bypass security checks and perform any action on the system. Rootkits can insert and execute arbitrary malicious code within the system's code path and hide their existence by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets from detection."
How can an attacker gain root privileges using a rootkit?,"Attackers can gain root privileges through vulnerabilities in the software stack, such as buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities. These weaknesses allow the rootkit to escalate its privileges to the root level, enabling it to compromise the system."
What are some common techniques used by rootkits to compromise systems?,"Rootkits employ various techniques to compromise systems. These include obtaining root privileges, which allows them to bypass security checks and perform any action. They can also insert and execute malicious code in the system's code path and hide their presence by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets."
How does a rootkit change the system call table?,"A rootkit can compromise the system by changing pointers of certain entries within the system call table. When other processes attempt to call these compromised system calls, they will inadvertently execute the attacker's code instead of the intended function."
Explain the example of a rootkit hijacking the `syscall_open` system call.,"In the example, the `syscall_open` system call, typically used to display running processes (like with the `ps` command), is hijacked. A rootkit redirects this system call to a new function called `new_syscall_open`. If the object being opened matches a predefined malicious name, `new_syscall_open` returns `NULL` to hide it. Otherwise, it calls the original `old_syscall_open` function to maintain normal operation. This redirection is achieved by modifying the pointer in the system call table that points to `syscall_open`."
What is the purpose of `old_syscall_open` in the rootkit example?,"`old_syscall_open` represents the original, legitimate system call function for opening files. In the rootkit's redirection mechanism, after checking for malicious conditions, `new_syscall_open` calls `old_syscall_open` to ensure that the intended file opening operation is still performed if the name is not malicious."
What is the role of `new_syscall_open` in the rootkit example?,"`new_syscall_open` is the malicious function that replaces the original `syscall_open` in the system call table. Its primary role is to intercept calls to `syscall_open`. It checks if the `object_name` being opened matches a list of malicious names. If it does, it returns `NULL` to hide the object. If the name is not malicious, it then calls the original `old_syscall_open` function to proceed with the legitimate operation."
How does a rootkit directly change a system call function?,"A rootkit can directly alter a system call function by overwriting a portion of its code. For instance, it can replace the initial bytes of a system call, such as the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open`, with instructions that cause execution to jump to a malicious function, like `malicious_open`. This faked system call will first execute the malicious function, then restore the original system call's code, and finally call the correct original system call."
Describe the process of a rootkit compromising `syscall_open` by modifying its code.,"A rootkit can compromise `syscall_open` by replacing its initial bytes with a jump instruction to a malicious function. First, it reads the original code of `syscall_open` into a buffer (`old_syscall_code`). Then, it prepares new code (`new_syscall_code`) that includes a jump instruction to the `malicious_open` function. This `new_syscall_code` is then written to overwrite the beginning of `syscall_open`. When `syscall_open` is invoked, it executes the malicious code, which calls `malicious_open`. Inside `malicious_open`, the original `syscall_open` code is restored, and then the original `syscall_open` is called to complete the operation."
What is the purpose of `malicious_open` in the context of compromising system call functions?,"`malicious_open` is a function executed by the rootkit when a system call like `syscall_open` is compromised. It first executes its own malicious logic (represented by `malicious_function()`). After executing its malicious tasks, it restores the original code of the compromised system call (`syscall_open`) and then calls the original system call function to ensure the operation completes as intended, albeit after the malicious code has run."
What does `memncpy` do in the provided code snippets?,"`memncpy` is a function used for copying a specified number of bytes from a source memory location to a destination memory location. In the context of the provided code, it's used to copy parts of system call code, such as saving the original bytes of `syscall_open` or injecting new code into it."
What is the significance of `SYS_call` in the `syscall()` API?,`SYS_call` is a placeholder in the `syscall()` API that represents the index of the specific system call a user process wishes to invoke. This index is used by the operating system kernel to locate and execute the corresponding system call function from the system call table.
What is the difference between user-level process and kernel level?,"A user-level process operates with limited privileges and cannot directly access hardware or critical system resources. The kernel level, on the other hand, is the core of the operating system with full privileges, allowing it to manage hardware, memory, and all system resources. System calls act as the bridge, enabling user-level processes to request services from the kernel."
What are the potential consequences of a rootkit gaining root privileges?,"When a rootkit gains root privileges, it can perform any action on the system without being subject to security checks. This includes inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code, hiding its presence, and potentially causing significant damage or data breaches."
How does a rootkit hide its existence?,"Rootkits hide their existence by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets from detection. This makes it difficult for security software and administrators to identify and remove the malware."
What is the role of `struct file sysmap` in the examples?,The `struct file sysmap` variable is used to open the `System.map-version` file. This file typically contains a mapping of symbols (like function names) to their memory addresses within the kernel. It's used in the examples to help locate the memory address of system call functions.
What does `read_syscall_table(sysmap)` likely do?,"Based on its usage, `read_syscall_table(sysmap)` likely reads the system map information obtained from `sysmap` to determine the memory address of the system call table itself or specific entries within it."
What is the purpose of the `malicious_object_name` array in the rootkit example?,"The `malicious_object_name` array, containing strings like `""xingyi""`, `""bind_shell""`, and `""reverse_shell""`, serves as a list of target names that the rootkit is looking for. When the `new_syscall_open` function encounters a file name that matches one of these entries, it triggers the malicious behavior."
What does it mean for a rootkit to 'redirect' a system call?,"Redirecting a system call means that when a program attempts to execute a specific system call, the rootkit intercepts this request and diverts it to a different, often malicious, function instead of the original system call. This is typically achieved by altering the pointers in the system call table."
What is the function of `syscall_addr[__NR_open]`?,`syscall_addr[__NR_open]` accesses the entry in the system call table corresponding to the `open` system call. `__NR_open` is a constant that represents the index for the `open` system call. This line retrieves the memory address of the original `open` system call function.
What is the purpose of overwriting the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open`?,Overwriting the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` is a technique used by rootkits to inject malicious code. These initial bytes are often replaced with assembly instructions that create a jump to a malicious function. This allows the rootkit to execute its own code whenever `syscall_open` is called.
What is the role of `pt` in the code snippet for compromising system call functions?,The `pt` array (likely short for 'pointer') is used to store the memory address of the `malicious_open` function. This address is then incorporated into the `new_syscall_code` which is injected into the original `syscall_open` function. This allows the `new_syscall_code` to jump to `malicious_open`.
"What does the assembly instruction `movl %pt, %ebp` likely do?","The assembly instruction `movl %pt, %ebp` likely moves the value of `pt` (which contains the address of `malicious_open`) into the `%ebp` register. This is a common step before executing a function call, as `%ebp` is often used as a base pointer for stack frames."
What is the purpose of the `jmp %ebp` instruction?,"The `jmp %ebp` instruction is an assembly jump instruction. In this context, after the address of `malicious_open` has been loaded into `%ebp`, `jmp %ebp` will transfer control of execution to the address stored in `%ebp`, effectively calling the `malicious_open` function."
What does `malicious_function()` represent?,`malicious_function()` represents the actual malicious code that the rootkit wants to execute. This function would contain the specific harmful actions the rootkit is designed to perform.
How does the rootkit restore the original system call after executing its malicious code?,"After executing its malicious code, the rootkit restores the original system call by copying the saved original code (stored in `old_syscall_code`) back to the beginning of the compromised system call function. It then calls the original system call function to complete the operation."
What is the significance of `return syscall_open(object_name)` in `malicious_open`?,"This line indicates that after the malicious actions are performed and the original system call code is restored, the `malicious_open` function then calls the original `syscall_open` function (which is now correctly restored) with the provided `object_name`. This ensures that the intended operation of the system call proceeds normally."
What are the implications of a rootkit changing pointers in the system call table?,"Changing pointers in the system call table allows a rootkit to intercept and redirect any system call. This means that any process attempting to use that system call will instead execute the rootkit's code, giving the rootkit significant control over the system's operations and the ability to hide its activities."
What is the difference between `syscall_open` and `sys_open`?,`syscall_open` is the user-level interface or wrapper function that a user process calls to request the `open` system call. `sys_open` is the actual kernel function that performs the file opening operation. The system call table maps the index for the `open` system call to the address of `sys_open`.
How can a rootkit use `syscall_open` to hide files?,"A rootkit can modify `syscall_open` to check the filename being passed to it. If the filename matches a predefined malicious pattern (e.g., a hidden configuration file or a malicious executable), the rootkit can cause `syscall_open` to return an error or `NULL`, effectively preventing the file from being accessed or displayed by legitimate processes."
What is the purpose of the `ps` command in relation to `syscall_open`?,"The `ps` command is used to display running processes. It likely utilizes the `syscall_open` system call internally to access information about processes, possibly by opening files related to process information in the `/proc` filesystem. A rootkit hijacking `syscall_open` could interfere with the `ps` command's ability to list processes."
What does it mean for a rootkit to 'compromise' a system call function?,To compromise a system call function means that a rootkit alters the function's behavior. This can be done by redirecting the system call to a different function or by directly modifying the code of the system call itself. The goal is to execute malicious code whenever the compromised system call is invoked.
What is the role of the kernel in handling system calls?,"The kernel is responsible for handling system calls. When a user-level process makes a system call, the kernel receives the request, identifies the requested service using the system call index, retrieves any necessary parameters, and then executes the corresponding kernel function. It then returns the result to the user-level process."
What are the security implications of a rootkit modifying the system call table?,"Modifying the system call table is a severe security breach. It allows the rootkit to intercept and control any system call, effectively gaining complete control over the operating system's functionality. This can lead to data theft, system instability, and the execution of arbitrary code."
How does a rootkit achieve persistence on a compromised system?,"While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets, rootkits often achieve persistence by modifying system startup files, installing themselves as kernel modules, or hooking into critical system processes. The ability to modify system calls is a powerful tool for maintaining stealth and control."
"What is the relationship between `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` and the system call table?","The `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` is the API used by user processes to initiate a system call. The `SYS_call` argument is an index that the kernel uses to look up the address of the actual kernel function within the system call table. The `arg1`, `arg2`, etc., are parameters passed to that kernel function."
What are the potential consequences of a rootkit directly changing system call functions?,"Directly changing system call functions allows a rootkit to execute its own code before or instead of the original system call. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or denial-of-service attacks, all while appearing to be a legitimate system operation."
What does `__NR_open` represent?,`__NR_open` is a preprocessor macro or constant that represents the numerical index assigned to the `open` system call within the operating system's system call table. It's used to access the specific entry for the `open` system call.
How can a rootkit leverage vulnerabilities like buffer overflow?,"A rootkit can leverage vulnerabilities like buffer overflow to gain control of program execution. By overflowing a buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory, including return addresses, allowing them to redirect program execution to malicious code, such as the rootkit's own payload."
"What is the purpose of hiding malicious processes, files, and network sockets?","Hiding malicious processes, files, and network sockets is a key tactic for rootkits to evade detection. By making these components invisible to standard system monitoring tools, the rootkit can operate undetected for extended periods, allowing it to carry out its objectives without being removed."
What is the function of `syscall_addr`?,"`syscall_addr` is a variable that stores the memory address of the system call table. By having this address, the code can then access individual entries within the table, such as the entry for a specific system call like `open`."
Explain the concept of a 'user-level process' in the context of system calls.,"A user-level process is an application or program that runs with limited privileges. It operates in a protected memory space and cannot directly interact with hardware or critical system resources. To perform such actions, it must request services from the operating system's kernel through system calls."
What is the primary function of the `syscall()` API?,"The primary function of the `syscall()` API is to provide a standardized way for user-level processes to request services from the operating system kernel. It acts as a gateway, allowing applications to transition from user mode to kernel mode to execute privileged operations."
