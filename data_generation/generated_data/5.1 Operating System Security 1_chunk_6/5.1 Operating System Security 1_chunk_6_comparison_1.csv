Compare a user-level process with the kernel level in the context of system calls.,"A user-level process is an application or program running in a less privileged mode that needs to request functions or services from the operating system's core. The kernel level, conversely, is the core part of the operating system that runs in a highly privileged mode, providing essential services like process control, file management, and device management. A system call serves as the interface that allows a user-level process to make these requests to the kernel level."
What are the differences between process control and file management as services provided by the kernel level?,"Process control refers to the kernel-level services that manage the execution of processes, including creating, terminating, scheduling, and synchronizing them. File management, on the other hand, refers to kernel-level services that handle the organization, storage, retrieval, and manipulation of files on storage devices, including operations like opening, reading, writing, and closing files. Both are fundamental categories of services that a user-level process can request from the kernel via a system call."
Compare the 'System call table' with 'system call functions' in the kernel region.,"The System call table is a data structure located in the kernel region that contains a table of pointers. Each pointer in this table points to a specific system call function. System call functions are the actual routines or code blocks within the kernel that implement the services requested by user-level processes. Thus, the table acts as an index or directory, while the functions are the executable code that performs the requested operations."
"What is the difference between the `SYS_call` argument and `arg1, arg2, ...` arguments in the `syscall` API?","In the `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` API, `SYS_call` represents the index of the specific system call function that the user process wishes to invoke. This index is used to look up the corresponding function pointer in the system call table. `arg1, arg2, ...` are the parameters or arguments that are passed to the chosen system call function, providing it with the necessary data to perform its operation."
Compare the general definition of malware with a rootkit.,"Malware is a broad term for any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. A rootkit is a specific type of malware that distinguishes itself by obtaining root privileges to compromise the computer. By gaining root privileges, a rootkit can operate with the highest level of system access, allowing it to bypass security checks, perform any actions on the system, insert and execute arbitrary malicious code, and hide its existence from detection."
What are the differences between a root user and a standard user in terms of system access?,"A root user, also known as a superuser, possesses the highest level of privileges on a system. This means a root user does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions to the system, including modifying core system files, installing software, and managing all processes. A standard user, in contrast, operates with limited privileges, subject to security checks, and can only perform actions within their designated user space or with explicit permissions, preventing them from making system-wide changes or accessing sensitive kernel resources directly."
Compare inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code with hiding its existence as rootkit actions.,"Inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code is a rootkit action focused on actively compromising the system's functionality by injecting and running harmful software within the system's code path. Hiding its existence, on the other hand, is a rootkit action focused on evading detection by concealing malicious processes, files, or network sockets from system monitoring tools and security software. Both actions are critical for a rootkit's success, with the former enabling active harm and the latter ensuring persistence and stealth."
What are the differences between a buffer overflow and a format string vulnerability?,"A buffer overflow is a vulnerability where a program attempts to write data to a fixed-size buffer beyond its allocated memory, overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, or the execution of malicious code. A format string vulnerability occurs when an attacker can supply a format string to a function like `printf`, allowing them to read or write arbitrary memory locations or even execute code. Both are types of vulnerabilities in the software stack that attackers can exploit to gain root privileges."
Compare the 'Highjack System-call Table' technique with the 'Compromise System Call Functions' technique.,"The 'Highjack System-call Table' technique involves a rootkit changing the pointers of certain entries in the system-call table, redirecting legitimate system calls to attacker-controlled code. This means the original system call function remains intact, but the system's lookup mechanism is altered. In contrast, the 'Compromise System Call Functions' technique directly modifies the system call function itself, typically by replacing its initial bytes with a jump instruction to malicious code. Here, the original function's code is altered at its entry point, rather than just its pointer in the table."
What are the differences in how `syscall_open` is handled in the 'Highjack System-call Table' example versus the 'Compromise System Call Functions' example?,"In the 'Highjack System-call Table' example, `syscall_open` is handled by redirecting its entry in the system-call table to a new function, `new_syscall_open`. The original `syscall_open` function's code is not directly modified. In the 'Compromise System Call Functions' example, the first 7 bytes of the `syscall_open` function's code are directly replaced with a jump instruction to `malicious_open`. This means the `syscall_open` function itself is altered at its entry point."
Compare the role of `new_syscall_open` in the table hijacking technique with `malicious_open` in the function compromise technique.,"`new_syscall_open` in the table hijacking technique is the attacker's function that is called instead of the original `syscall_open` when its pointer in the system-call table is modified. Its primary role is to inspect the object being opened (e.g., for malicious names) and either hide it by returning `NULL` or call the legitimate `old_syscall_open`. `malicious_open` in the function compromise technique is the attacker's function that is jumped to when the first bytes of the original `syscall_open` are overwritten. Its role is to first execute a malicious function, then restore the original `syscall_open`'s initial bytes, and finally call the now-restored original `syscall_open`."
What are the differences in the immediate effect on the system call mechanism when a rootkit 'Highjacks System-call Table' versus 'Compromises System Call Functions'?,"When a rootkit 'Highjacks System-call Table', the immediate effect is that the system's dispatcher, when looking up a system call by its index, will retrieve a pointer to the attacker's code (`new_syscall_open`) instead of the legitimate system call function. The original function's code remains untouched. When a rootkit 'Compromises System Call Functions', the immediate effect is that any attempt to execute the targeted system call function (e.g., `syscall_open`) will directly execute the attacker's jump instruction, transferring control to `malicious_open` at the very beginning of the function's execution. The original function's entry point is altered."
Compare the `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` before and after a rootkit highjacks the system-call table.,"Before a rootkit highjacks the system-call table, `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` would contain the pointer to the legitimate `syscall_open` function, which is the standard system call for opening files. After the rootkit highjacks the table, `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` is changed to point to `new_syscall_open`, which is the attacker's custom function designed to intercept and potentially manipulate the `open` operation. The original pointer is typically saved as `old_syscall_open` for later use by the malicious function."
What are the differences between `syscall_open` and `new_syscall_open` in the context of system call table hijacking?,"`syscall_open` refers to the original, legitimate system call function responsible for handling file open operations. `new_syscall_open` is the malicious function introduced by the rootkit. When the system-call table is hijacked, the pointer that originally pointed to `syscall_open` is modified to point to `new_syscall_open`. `new_syscall_open` then contains logic to check if the object being opened is malicious, potentially hiding it, or otherwise calling the original `syscall_open` (which is saved as `old_syscall_open`)."
Compare the two outcomes within `new_syscall_open` when an object matches a malicious name versus when it does not.,"Within `new_syscall_open`, if the object to be opened matches a malicious name, the function's logic dictates that it should return `NULL`. This action effectively hides the existence of the malicious object from the user or monitoring processes. If the object does not match a malicious name, `new_syscall_open` will then call the normal `old_syscall_open`, which is the legitimate, original system call function, allowing the non-malicious object to be opened as usual."
What are the differences between `old_syscall_open` and `new_syscall_open` in the system call table hijacking example?,"`old_syscall_open` is a variable or pointer used by the rootkit to store the address of the *original* `syscall_open` function before the system-call table is modified. This allows the rootkit's `new_syscall_open` function to eventually call the legitimate system call if the object being opened is not malicious. `new_syscall_open` is the *new* function implemented by the rootkit, which replaces the pointer to `syscall_open` in the system-call table. It contains the malicious logic for interception and potential hiding of files."
Compare the purpose of `syscall_open` (as used by `ps command`) with the purpose of `new_syscall_open`.,"The purpose of `syscall_open` (as used by the `ps command`) is to open files, which in the context of `ps` might involve accessing process-related files to display running processes. Its fundamental purpose is legitimate file access. The purpose of `new_syscall_open`, however, is to intercept and potentially manipulate file open requests. Specifically, it aims to hide malicious processes, files, or network sockets by returning `NULL` if the object's name matches a predefined malicious pattern, thereby preventing its detection."
What are the differences between `malicious_object_name` and a regular object name in the context of `new_syscall_open`?,"`malicious_object_name` refers to a predefined set of strings (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"", ""reverse_shell"") that `new_syscall_open` uses to identify objects associated with the rootkit or other malicious activities. If an object's name matches one of these, it is considered malicious. A regular object name is any other name that does not match the `malicious_object_name` list. `new_syscall_open` treats these differently, hiding malicious objects while allowing regular objects to be processed by the original system call."
Compare the state of the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` before and after a rootkit compromises the system call function.,"Before a rootkit compromises the system call function, the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` contain the legitimate, original machine code instructions that begin the `syscall_open` function's execution. After the rootkit compromises the function, these first 7 bytes are replaced with a jump instruction (e.g., `movl %pt, %ebp` and `jmp %ebp`) that redirects execution flow to `malicious_open`. The original 7 bytes are typically saved by the rootkit in `old_syscall_code` so they can be restored later."
What are the differences between `syscall_open` and `malicious_open` in the context of compromising system call functions?,"`syscall_open` refers to the original, legitimate system call function for opening files. In the compromise technique, its initial code is directly altered. `malicious_open` is the attacker's custom function that is executed when the compromised `syscall_open` is called. `malicious_open` first executes its own malicious function, then restores the original `syscall_open`'s initial bytes, and finally calls the now-restored original `syscall_open` to complete the legitimate operation."
Compare the role of `malicious_function()` with the subsequent restoration and call to `syscall_open(object_name)` within `malicious_open`.,"Within `malicious_open`, `malicious_function()` represents the attacker's primary payload or action, such as logging sensitive data, escalating privileges, or performing other covert operations. This is the core malicious activity. The subsequent restoration of `syscall_open`'s original bytes (using `memncpy(syscall_open, old_syscall_code, 7)`) and the call to `syscall_open(object_name)` serve to maintain system stability and stealth. By restoring the original code and then executing the legitimate system call, the rootkit ensures that the expected system behavior occurs, minimizing the chances of detection or system crashes, while still having executed its malicious payload."
What are the differences between `old_syscall_code` and `new_syscall_code` in the function compromise example?,"`old_syscall_code` is a buffer (e.g., `char old_syscall_code[7]`) used to store the first 7 bytes of the original `syscall_open` function's machine code *before* they are overwritten by the rootkit. This allows the `malicious_open` function to restore the original entry point. `new_syscall_code` is a buffer (e.g., `char new_syscall_code[7]`) that contains the new machine code instructions, specifically a jump instruction, which will replace the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open`. This `new_syscall_code` redirects execution to `malicious_open`."
Compare the action of replacing pointers in the system-call table with replacing bytes of a system call function.,"Replacing pointers in the system-call table, as seen in the 'Highjack System-call Table' technique, involves modifying an entry in a lookup table so that it points to a different memory address (the attacker's code) instead of the original system call function. The original function's code itself remains untouched. Replacing bytes of a system call function, as seen in the 'Compromise System Call Functions' technique, involves directly altering the executable code of the system call function at its entry point, typically by inserting a jump instruction. This directly modifies the function's instructions rather than just its reference in a table."
What are the differences between the `syscall` API and the internal mechanism of the system call table?,"The `syscall` API (`syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`) is the programmatic interface that a user-level process uses to initiate a system call. It's the user-facing method for requesting kernel services. The internal mechanism of the system call table, on the other hand, is the kernel's underlying data structure and process for resolving that request. It involves looking up the `SYS_call` index in the system call table to find the pointer to the actual system call function and then executing that function with the provided arguments. The API is the request, the table mechanism is the fulfillment process."
Compare the concept of 'Process control' with 'Device management' as services provided by the kernel.,"Process control refers to the kernel's responsibility for managing the lifecycle and execution of processes, including tasks like creating new processes, terminating existing ones, scheduling their CPU time, and handling inter-process communication. Device management, conversely, refers to the kernel's role in managing hardware devices connected to the system, such as disk drives, network interfaces, and input/output peripherals. This includes tasks like allocating devices, handling device drivers, and managing data transfer to and from devices. Both are critical services that the kernel provides to user-level processes."
What are the differences between a system call and a regular function call within a user-level process?,"A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level, requiring a transition from user mode to kernel mode due to the privileged nature of the requested operations. A regular function call, in contrast, is an invocation of a subroutine or function within the same user-level process or library, operating entirely within user mode and not requiring any special privileges or mode transitions to the kernel."
Compare the method of gaining root privileges through 'Vulnerabilities in the software stack' with other potential methods (not detailed in the document).,"The document explicitly states that attackers can gain root privileges through 'Vulnerabilities in the software stack,' citing examples like buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities. This method relies on exploiting flaws in legitimate software to elevate privileges. The document does not detail other potential methods for gaining root privileges, focusing solely on software stack vulnerabilities as the mechanism for an attacker to achieve root access for a rootkit."
What are the differences between the `sys_waitpid` system call and the `sys_exit` system call?,"`sys_waitpid` is a system call typically used for process control, allowing a parent process to wait for a child process to change state (e.g., terminate, stop, or continue) and retrieve information about its status. `sys_exit`, on the other hand, is a system call used for process control that explicitly terminates the calling process, returning an exit status to its parent process. Both are examples of system call functions pointed to by the system call table."
Compare the `sys_fork` system call with the `sys_read` system call.,"`sys_fork` is a system call primarily used for process control, specifically to create a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process (child) is an almost exact copy of the calling process (parent). `sys_read`, in contrast, is a system call used for file management, allowing a process to read data from a file descriptor into a buffer. Both are examples of distinct system call functions available through the system call table."
What are the differences between the `sys_write` system call and the `sys_open` system call?,"`sys_write` is a system call used for file management, enabling a process to write data from a buffer to a file descriptor. `sys_open`, also a file management system call, is used to open a file or device, returning a file descriptor that can then be used by other system calls like `sys_read` or `sys_write` to interact with the opened resource. `sys_open` establishes access, while `sys_write` performs data output."
Compare the `sys_open` system call with the `sys_close` system call.,"`sys_open` is a system call used for file management that establishes a connection to a file or device, returning a file descriptor that identifies the opened resource. `sys_close`, conversely, is a system call also used for file management that terminates the connection to a file or device associated with a given file descriptor, releasing the resources held by that descriptor. `sys_open` initiates access, while `sys_close` concludes it."
What are the differences between the `syscall_addr` variable and the `syscall_open` variable in the context of system call table manipulation?,"`syscall_addr` is a pointer (specifically, `long *syscall_addr`) that is initialized to point to the base of the system call table, allowing access to individual entries. `syscall_open` is a variable (or a macro representing an entry) that, after reading the system map, is assigned the address of the specific `open` system call function from the `syscall_addr` table (e.g., `syscall_addr[__NR_open]`). So, `syscall_addr` points to the table itself, while `syscall_open` points to a specific function within that table."
Compare the `strstr` function's role in `new_syscall_open` with its general string searching purpose.,"In `new_syscall_open`, the `strstr` function is specifically used to check if the `object_name` (the name of the file or process being opened) contains any of the predefined `malicious_object_name` strings. Its purpose here is to identify and filter out malicious objects. Generally, `strstr` is a standard C library function that searches for the first occurrence of a substring within another string, returning a pointer to the beginning of the substring or `NULL` if not found. Its general purpose is broad string pattern matching, while in `new_syscall_open` it's applied for malicious object detection."
What are the differences between `return NULL` and `return old_syscall_open(object_name)` within `new_syscall_open`?,"`return NULL` within `new_syscall_open` is executed when the `object_name` matches a malicious pattern. Its purpose is to hide the malicious object, making it appear as if the open operation failed or the object does not exist, thus preventing detection. `return old_syscall_open(object_name)` is executed when the `object_name` is not malicious. Its purpose is to pass control to the original, legitimate `syscall_open` function, allowing the non-malicious object to be opened normally and maintaining expected system behavior."
Compare the `memncpy` function's use for saving `old_syscall_code` with its use for installing `new_syscall_code`.,"The `memncpy` function is used for saving `old_syscall_code` by copying the first 7 bytes from the original `syscall_open` function into the `old_syscall_code` buffer. This preserves the legitimate entry point before modification. It is then used for installing `new_syscall_code` by copying the 7 bytes of the malicious jump instruction from the `new_syscall_code` buffer into the beginning of the `syscall_open` function's memory location. This overwrites the original entry point and redirects execution. In both cases, `memncpy` performs a byte-level copy, but with different source and destination purposes."
What are the differences between the `malicious_function()` call and the `memncpy` calls within `malicious_open`?,"Within `malicious_open`, `malicious_function()` is a call to the attacker's core payload, which performs the actual malicious activity (e.g., data exfiltration, privilege escalation). This is the primary harmful action. The `memncpy` calls, specifically `memncpy(syscall_open, old_syscall_code, 7)` and `memncpy(syscall_open, new_syscall_code, 7)`, are used for manipulating the `syscall_open` function's code. The first `memncpy` restores the original 7 bytes of `syscall_open` before the malicious function is called, and the second `memncpy` (which would have been done earlier to install the jump) is reversed by the restoration. These `memncpy` operations are for stealth and control flow, ensuring the original function can be called correctly after the malicious payload executes, rather than being the payload itself."
Compare the `ps command` with the `syscall_open` function.,"The `ps command` is a user-level utility or program that displays information about running processes. It operates by making system calls to the kernel to gather process data. `syscall_open` is a specific system call function provided by the kernel, used for opening files or devices. While the `ps command` might utilize `syscall_open` (or similar file access system calls) to read process-related files, `ps` is the application, and `syscall_open` is a fundamental kernel service it might invoke."
What are the differences between `__NR_open` and `syscall_addr`?,"`__NR_open` is a symbolic constant or macro that represents the numerical index of the `open` system call within the system call table. It's an identifier for a specific system call. `syscall_addr` is a pointer to the base address of the system call table itself. To access the `open` system call function, one would typically use `syscall_addr[__NR_open]`, where `__NR_open` acts as an offset or index into the table pointed to by `syscall_addr`."
Compare the concept of 'root privileges' with 'compromising the computer'.,"Root privileges refer to the highest level of administrative access and control over an operating system, allowing a user or program to perform any action without security checks. Compromising the computer, on the other hand, is the broader act of gaining unauthorized access to a computer system and potentially taking control of it, often with malicious intent. Obtaining root privileges is a *means* by which a rootkit can compromise the computer, as it grants the necessary power to insert malicious code, hide its presence, and fully control the system."
What are the differences between `struct file sysmap` and `long *syscall_addr`?,"`struct file sysmap` is a file structure variable used to represent an opened file, specifically ""System.map-version"" in the provided code. This file likely contains symbols and addresses, including those of system calls. `long *syscall_addr` is a pointer to a long integer, which is then assigned the base address of the system call table after reading it from the `sysmap` file. So, `sysmap` represents a file handle for reading system information, while `syscall_addr` is a pointer to the in-memory system call table itself."
"Compare the action of `read_syscall_table(sysmap)` with `open(""System.map-version"")`.","`open(""System.map-version"")` is a function call that attempts to open a file named ""System.map-version"" and returns a file handle or descriptor, which is then stored in `sysmap`. This is the initial step to gain access to the system map file. `read_syscall_table(sysmap)` is a function call that takes the opened file handle (`sysmap`) as an argument and is responsible for parsing that file to extract and return the base address of the system call table. So, `open` establishes access to the file, while `read_syscall_table` processes the file's content to find the system call table's address."
What are the differences between `pt[4]` and `new_syscall_code[7]`?,"`pt[4]` is a character array of size 4, used to store the 4-byte address of `malicious_open` as part of constructing a jump instruction. This address is then embedded into the `new_syscall_code`. `new_syscall_code[7]` is a character array of size 7, which holds the complete 7-byte machine code sequence for the jump instruction. This sequence includes the `movl` instruction (which uses the address from `pt`) and the `jmp` instruction, designed to replace the initial bytes of the original system call function."
"Compare the `movl %pt, %ebp` instruction with the `jmp %ebp` instruction in the `new_syscall_code`.","The `movl %pt, %ebp` instruction is responsible for moving the address of the malicious function (stored in `pt`) into the `%ebp` register. This sets up the target address for the subsequent jump. The `jmp %ebp` instruction then performs an unconditional jump to the address currently held in the `%ebp` register, effectively transferring control to `malicious_open`. Together, these two instructions form the 7-byte jump sequence that redirects the execution flow of the compromised system call."
What are the differences between the `syscall_open` in the 'Highjack System-call Table' diagram and the `sys_open` in the 'Compromise System Call Functions' diagram?,"In the 'Highjack System-call Table' diagram, `syscall_open` represents an entry in the system call table that is being redirected. The arrow from `SYS_call` points to `syscall_open`, which is then shown as being redirected to `new_sys_open` (which is `new_syscall_open`). In the 'Compromise System Call Functions' diagram, `sys_open` (which is `syscall_open` in the text) represents the actual system call function whose initial code block is being directly modified. The diagram shows `sys_open`'s first part being replaced by `new_syscall_code` which jumps to `malicious_open`. The difference lies in whether the table entry is changed or the function's code itself is changed."
Compare the `old_sys_open` box in the table hijacking diagram with the `malicious_open` box in the function compromise diagram.,"In the table hijacking diagram, `old_sys_open` represents the original, legitimate `syscall_open` function that the `new_sys_open` (attacker's code) might eventually call if the object is not malicious. It's the preserved original. In the function compromise diagram, `malicious_open` is the attacker's function that is directly jumped to when the `sys_open` function's initial bytes are overwritten. This `malicious_open` contains the malicious payload and is responsible for restoring and calling the original `sys_open` after its malicious actions. `old_sys_open` is a reference to the original, while `malicious_open` is the primary malicious interceptor."
What are the differences between the `new_sys_open` box in the table hijacking diagram and the `new_syscall_code` box in the function compromise diagram?,"In the table hijacking diagram, `new_sys_open` represents the attacker's custom function (`new_syscall_open`) that the system call table entry is redirected to. It's a complete function with its own logic. In the function compromise diagram, `new_syscall_code` represents the 7-byte machine code snippet that replaces the beginning of the original `sys_open` function. This `new_syscall_code` is merely a jump instruction, not a complete function, whose sole purpose is to redirect execution to `malicious_open`."
Compare the concept of 'pointers in the kernel region' with 'arbitrary malicious code'.,"'Pointers in the kernel region' refers to memory addresses stored within the kernel's protected memory space, specifically those within the system call table that point to legitimate system call functions. These are essential for the operating system's normal operation. 'Arbitrary malicious code' refers to any harmful program instructions or data that an attacker inserts into the system. While pointers are legitimate system components, a rootkit can manipulate these pointers to redirect execution to arbitrary malicious code, thereby compromising the system."
What are the differences between a 'table of pointers' and 'parameters' in the context of issuing a system call?,"A 'table of pointers' (the system call table) is a data structure in the kernel region that maps system call indices to the memory addresses of their corresponding functions. It's a lookup mechanism. 'Parameters' are the specific values or data (e.g., `arg1, arg2, ...`) that a user process passes to a system call function to provide context or input for its operation. The table helps locate the function, while parameters provide the data for the function to act upon."
Compare the security implications of a root user not going through security checks with a rootkit hiding its existence.,"A root user not going through security checks implies that once root privileges are obtained, the entity (whether legitimate or malicious) has unrestricted access and can perform any action without further authorization prompts or barriers. This is a fundamental aspect of root access. A rootkit hiding its existence is a specific malicious action that leverages these root privileges to conceal its processes, files, and network activity from detection. While both relate to bypassing security, the former describes the inherent power of root, and the latter describes a specific stealth tactic employed by a rootkit using that power."
"What are the differences between `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` and `new_syscall_open(char *object_name)`?","`syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` is the generic API used by a user process to invoke *any* system call, where `SYS_call` specifies which system call and `arg1, arg2, ...` are its generic parameters. `new_syscall_open(char *object_name)` is a specific, malicious function implemented by a rootkit. It is designed to *replace* a legitimate system call (like `syscall_open`) and specifically takes `char *object_name` as its parameter, which it uses to determine if the object being opened is malicious. The former is a general system interface, the latter is a specific malicious implementation."
Compare the `syscall_open` in the code snippet on page 3 with the `syscall_open` in the code snippet on page 4.,"In the code snippet on page 3, `syscall_open` is treated as a pointer to the original `open` system call function, whose address is read from the system map. This pointer is then *reassigned* to `new_syscall_open()` to hijack the table. In the code snippet on page 4, `syscall_open` refers to the actual memory location of the `open` system call function itself, whose *initial bytes* are directly read into `old_syscall_code` and then *overwritten* with `new_syscall_code` to compromise the function. The former manipulates the pointer to the function, the latter manipulates the function's code directly."
What are the differences between `old_syscall_open` (page 3) and `old_syscall_code` (page 4)?,`old_syscall_open` (page 3) is a pointer variable that stores the *address* of the original `syscall_open` function. It's used by the `new_syscall_open` function to call the legitimate `open` system call if the object is not malicious. `old_syscall_code` (page 4) is a character array (a buffer) that stores the *first 7 bytes of the actual machine code* of the original `syscall_open` function. It's used by `malicious_open` to restore the original function's entry point after the malicious code has executed.
Compare the effect of `return NULL` in `new_syscall_open` with the effect of `malicious_function()` in `malicious_open`.,"The effect of `return NULL` in `new_syscall_open` is to hide the existence of a malicious object by making the `open` system call appear to fail or return no result when a malicious name is detected. This is a stealth mechanism. The effect of `malicious_function()` in `malicious_open` is to execute the rootkit's primary malicious payload, which could involve various harmful actions like data theft, privilege escalation, or system manipulation. While both are malicious, `return NULL` is about concealment, and `malicious_function()` is about active compromise."
What are the differences between `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` and `syscall_addr[__NR_close]`?,"`syscall_addr[__NR_open]` refers to the pointer within the system call table that specifically points to the `sys_open` system call function, which is used for opening files. `syscall_addr[__NR_close]` refers to the pointer within the same system call table that specifically points to the `sys_close` system call function, which is used for closing files. They are distinct entries in the system call table, each pointing to a different kernel service function."
Compare the `syscall_open` variable with the `malicious_object_name` variable.,"`syscall_open` is a variable that holds the memory address of the system call function responsible for opening files. It represents a legitimate kernel service. `malicious_object_name` is an array of strings (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"") that represent names of files, processes, or other objects associated with the rootkit that should be hidden. `syscall_open` is a target for manipulation, while `malicious_object_name` is a criterion used by the malicious code to decide its actions."
"What are the differences between `arg1, arg2, ...` and `char *object_name` as parameters?","`arg1, arg2, ...` are generic placeholders for parameters passed to any system call via the `syscall` API. Their specific meaning depends entirely on the `SYS_call` being invoked. `char *object_name` is a specific parameter type, a pointer to a character string, used in the context of `new_syscall_open` and `malicious_open`. It specifically represents the name of the file or object that the system call is attempting to open, which is then used by the rootkit's logic for detection or manipulation."
Compare the `System.map-version` file with the system call table.,"The `System.map-version` file is a textual file (likely on disk) that contains a list of symbols (function names, variable names) and their corresponding memory addresses within the kernel. It's a static mapping used for debugging and analysis. The system call table, on the other hand, is an in-memory data structure (a table of pointers) within the kernel region that directly holds the executable addresses of system call functions. The `System.map-version` file can be used to *find* the address of the system call table, but it is not the table itself."
"What are the differences between `memncpy(old_syscall_code, syscall_open, 7)` and `memncpy(syscall_open, new_syscall_code, 7)`?","`memncpy(old_syscall_code, syscall_open, 7)` copies the first 7 bytes *from* the `syscall_open` function's memory location *to* the `old_syscall_code` buffer. This action saves the original instructions. `memncpy(syscall_open, new_syscall_code, 7)` copies the 7 bytes *from* the `new_syscall_code` buffer *to* the `syscall_open` function's memory location. This action overwrites the original instructions with the malicious jump code. They are inverse operations in terms of data flow, one saving and one overwriting."
"Compare the `if strstr(object_name, malicious_object_name)` condition with the `malicious_function()` call.","The `if strstr(object_name, malicious_object_name)` condition is a check performed by `new_syscall_open` to determine if the object being opened is associated with the rootkit. It's a conditional logic for detection. The `malicious_function()` call, found within `malicious_open`, is an unconditional execution of the rootkit's payload. The condition is a gatekeeper for specific stealth actions, while the function call is the direct execution of the core malicious activity after interception."
What are the differences between `sys_waitpid` and `sys_fork`?,"`sys_waitpid` is a system call used by a parent process to wait for state changes (like termination) in its child processes. It's a mechanism for process synchronization and status retrieval. `sys_fork`, conversely, is a system call used to create a new, identical child process from the calling parent process. `sys_fork` creates processes, while `sys_waitpid` monitors and collects information from them."
Compare the `sys_read` system call with the `sys_write` system call.,"`sys_read` is a system call that allows a process to input data from a file or device, specified by a file descriptor, into a memory buffer. `sys_write` is a system call that allows a process to output data from a memory buffer to a file or device, also specified by a file descriptor. `sys_read` is for input operations, and `sys_write` is for output operations, both falling under file management services."
What are the differences between the `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` assignment on page 3 and the `syscall_open = syscall_addr[__NR_open]` assignment on page 4?,"On page 3, `syscall_addr[__NR_open] = new_syscall_open();` is an assignment that *modifies* the system call table. It changes the pointer for the `open` system call to point to the attacker's `new_syscall_open` function. On page 4, `syscall_open = syscall_addr[__NR_open];` is an assignment that *reads* the current pointer for the `open` system call from the system call table and stores it in the `syscall_open` variable. This is typically done to get the address of the original function before modifying its code directly."
Compare the `return NULL` action in `new_syscall_open` with the `return syscall_open(object_name)` action in `malicious_open`.,"The `return NULL` action in `new_syscall_open` is a terminal action for malicious objects; it prevents the original system call from being executed and effectively hides the object. The `return syscall_open(object_name)` action in `malicious_open` is executed *after* the malicious function has run and the original `syscall_open`'s code has been restored. Its purpose is to ensure the legitimate `open` operation completes normally, maintaining system functionality and stealth, rather than hiding the object."
What are the differences between the `syscall_open` variable and the `old_syscall_code` variable?,"`syscall_open` is a variable that holds the memory address of the `open` system call function. It's a pointer to the function's entry point. `old_syscall_code` is a buffer (a `char` array) that stores the *actual machine code bytes* of the first part of the `syscall_open` function. `syscall_open` refers to where the function is, while `old_syscall_code` stores a copy of what's at the beginning of that location."
Compare the `malicious_object_name` array with the `pt` array.,"`malicious_object_name` is an array of strings (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"") used to identify specific names of files or processes that a rootkit wants to hide or manipulate. It's a list of targets. The `pt` array is a 4-byte character array used to temporarily store the memory address of the `malicious_open` function. This address is then embedded into the `new_syscall_code` to create a jump instruction. `malicious_object_name` defines what to look for, while `pt` is a component for redirecting execution."
What are the differences between `Process control` and `File management` as categories of system call services?,"`Process control` encompasses system calls related to the creation, termination, scheduling, and overall management of processes within the operating system. Examples include `sys_fork` and `sys_exit`. `File management` encompasses system calls related to the creation, deletion, reading, writing, and manipulation of files and directories on storage devices. Examples include `sys_open`, `sys_read`, and `sys_write`. Both are distinct categories of essential services provided by the kernel."
Compare the `syscall_addr` pointer with the `syscall_open` function itself.,"`syscall_addr` is a pointer to the base of the system call table, which is an array of pointers. It allows access to the entire table. The `syscall_open` function itself is the actual executable code block in the kernel that performs the file open operation. `syscall_addr` points to the structure that *contains* the pointer to `syscall_open`, while `syscall_open` is the target code that ultimately executes the requested service."
What are the differences between `sys_exit` and `sys_close`?,"`sys_exit` is a process control system call that terminates the calling process, releasing its resources and returning an exit status to its parent. `sys_close` is a file management system call that closes a file descriptor, releasing the resources associated with an opened file or device. `sys_exit` deals with the termination of an entire process, while `sys_close` deals with the termination of a specific file or device connection within a process."
Compare the `syscall_open` function's original behavior with its behavior after being compromised by the 'Highjack System-call Table' technique.,"The `syscall_open` function's original behavior is to directly execute the legitimate kernel code for opening a file or device. After being compromised by the 'Highjack System-call Table' technique, any call intended for `syscall_open` is redirected to `new_syscall_open`. This means its behavior is now to first execute the attacker's code, which decides whether to hide a malicious object by returning `NULL` or to eventually call the original `syscall_open` (saved as `old_syscall_open`) for non-malicious objects."
What are the differences between the `syscall_open` function's original behavior and its behavior after being compromised by the 'Compromise System Call Functions' technique?,"The `syscall_open` function's original behavior is to directly execute the legitimate kernel code for opening a file or device. After being compromised by the 'Compromise System Call Functions' technique, the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` are replaced with a jump instruction. Its behavior is now to immediately transfer control to `malicious_open`. `malicious_open` then executes its malicious payload, restores the original `syscall_open`'s initial bytes, and finally calls the now-restored original `syscall_open` to complete the legitimate operation. The original code is temporarily replaced and then restored."
"Compare the `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` assignment on page 3 with the `memncpy(syscall_open, new_syscall_code, 7)` on page 4.","The `syscall_addr[__NR_open] = new_syscall_open();` assignment on page 3 modifies an entry in the system call table. It changes a pointer in a data structure to redirect future calls. The `memncpy(syscall_open, new_syscall_code, 7)` on page 4 modifies the actual executable code of the `syscall_open` function itself in memory. It overwrites the function's initial instructions. The former changes a reference, the latter changes the referenced code."
