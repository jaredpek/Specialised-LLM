Define what a system call is.,A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. The kernel level is the core part of an operating system that manages system resources and provides privileged operations.
What are the primary categories of functions or services that a system call enables a user-level process to request from the kernel level?,"A system call enables a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level in categories such as process control, file management, and device management. These categories encompass a wide range of operations necessary for an operating system to function."
"Explain the role of the ""System call table"" in issuing a system call.","The ""System call table"" is a crucial component in issuing a system call. It is a table of pointers located in the kernel region, with each pointer directing to a different system call function. When a user process initiates a system call, it references this table to find the appropriate function to execute. The kernel region is a protected area of memory where the operating system's core components reside."
"Describe the general process a user process follows to issue a system call, including the API used.","To issue a system call, a user process passes the index of the desired system call and its parameters using a specific API. The general form of this API is `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`, where `SYS_call` represents the index of the system call, and `arg1, arg2, ...` are the arguments or parameters required by that specific system call function."
Provide examples of specific system call functions that might be found in a system call table.,"Examples of specific system call functions that might be found in a system call table include `sys_waitpid`, `sys_exit`, `sys_fork`, `sys_read`, `sys_write`, `sys_open`, and `sys_close`. These functions correspond to common operating system operations like waiting for a process, exiting a process, creating a new process, reading data, writing data, opening a file, and closing a file, respectively."
What is the significance of the kernel level in the context of system calls?,"The kernel level is significant in the context of system calls because it is the privileged environment where system calls are executed. A system call acts as an interface for user-level processes to request functions or services directly from this kernel level, which has direct access to hardware and manages system resources, ensuring system integrity and security."
How does a user-level process interact with the kernel level through a system call?,"A user-level process interacts with the kernel level through a system call by using it as an interface to request specific functions or services. Instead of directly accessing privileged resources, the user process makes a request to the kernel via a system call, and the kernel then performs the requested operation on its behalf, returning the result to the user process."
What kind of information does a user process pass when invoking the `syscall` API?,"When invoking the `syscall` API, a user process passes two main types of information: the index of the system call (`SYS_call`) it wishes to execute and any necessary parameters (`arg1, arg2, ...`) that the specific system call function requires for its operation. The index tells the kernel which service is requested, and the parameters provide the necessary data for that service."
Where is the system call table located?,"The system call table is located in the kernel region. The kernel region is a protected memory area where the operating system's core components and data structures, including the system call table, reside, ensuring their integrity and preventing unauthorized access by user-level processes."
Can a user-level process directly access kernel-level functions without a system call?,"No, a user-level process cannot directly access kernel-level functions without a system call. A system call serves as the designated interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level, which operates in a more privileged mode to protect system resources and maintain stability."
Define what a rootkit is.,"A rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. Root privileges refer to the highest level of administrative access on a system, allowing unrestricted control over the operating system and its resources."
What are the capabilities of a root user on a compromised system?,"On a compromised system, a root user, which a rootkit obtains privileges for, does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions to the system. This includes inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path and hiding its existence from being detected."
Describe how a rootkit can hide its existence.,"A rootkit can hide its existence by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets from being detected. This allows the malware to operate covertly within the system without being easily discovered by security tools or system administrators, maintaining persistence and avoiding removal."
What are the two main actions a root user can perform on a system once root privileges are obtained?,"Once root privileges are obtained, a root user can perform two main actions: first, insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path, and second, hide its existence, including malicious processes, files, and network sockets, from being detected. These actions enable comprehensive control and stealth."
How can an attacker typically gain root privileges to deploy a rootkit?,"An attacker can typically gain root privileges to deploy a rootkit by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software stack. Examples of such vulnerabilities include buffer overflow and format string exploits. A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-length buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory. A format string vulnerability arises when user input is directly used as the format string in functions like `printf`, allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory locations."
"What does it mean for a root user to ""not go through any security checks""?","For a root user to ""not go through any security checks"" means that once root privileges are obtained, the user (or the rootkit operating with these privileges) bypasses the standard access control mechanisms and permissions that normally restrict actions on a system. This allows them to perform any operation without authorization prompts or system-level restrictions, granting complete control."
"What is ""arbitrary malicious code"" in the context of a rootkit?","In the context of a rootkit, ""arbitrary malicious code"" refers to any code designed by an attacker to perform harmful or unauthorized actions. Because a rootkit operates with root privileges, it can insert and execute this code anywhere in the system's code path, giving the attacker complete control over the system's behavior and data."
"What are ""vulnerabilities in the software stack"" and how do they relate to rootkits?","""Vulnerabilities in the software stack"" refer to flaws or weaknesses in the design, implementation, or configuration of software components that can be exploited by attackers. These vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or format string bugs, are the primary means by which an attacker can gain root privileges, which is a prerequisite for deploying and operating a rootkit effectively."
Why is obtaining root privileges essential for a rootkit?,"Obtaining root privileges is essential for a rootkit because these privileges grant the highest level of access and control over a computer system. With root privileges, the rootkit can bypass security checks, execute arbitrary malicious code, and effectively hide its presence, making it difficult to detect and remove, thus ensuring its persistence and effectiveness."
Can a rootkit operate without root privileges?,"No, a rootkit is defined as malware that *obtains root privileges* to compromise the computer. Its core functionality, such as performing any actions to the system, inserting malicious code, and hiding its existence, relies on having these elevated privileges. Without root privileges, it would be severely limited in its capabilities and detection evasion."
How does a rootkit hijack the system-call table?,"A rootkit hijacks the system-call table by changing the pointers of certain entries within it. The system-call table is a table of pointers in the kernel region that point to different system call functions. By altering these pointers, the rootkit redirects legitimate system calls to execute the attacker's malicious code instead of the original system function."
What is the consequence of a rootkit hijacking the system-call table?,"The consequence of a rootkit hijacking the system-call table is that other processes calling the modified system calls will inadvertently execute the attacker's code. This allows the rootkit to intercept, modify, or completely control the behavior of legitimate system operations, potentially leading to data theft, system manipulation, or further compromise."
Provide an example of a system call that can be hijacked by a rootkit and its typical use.,"An example of a system call that can be hijacked by a rootkit is `syscall_open`. This system call is typically used to display running processes, for instance, by the `ps` command. By hijacking `syscall_open`, a rootkit can manipulate the information returned about open files or processes, effectively hiding its own malicious activities."
Explain how `syscall_open` is redirected by a rootkit in the provided example.,"In the provided example, `syscall_open` is redirected by a rootkit to a new function called `new_syscall_open`. This is achieved by changing the pointer in the system-call table that originally pointed to `syscall_open` to now point to `new_syscall_open`. Consequently, any subsequent calls to `syscall_open` will execute the rootkit's `new_syscall_open` function."
Describe the logic implemented within `new_syscall_open` to hide malicious objects.,"The logic implemented within `new_syscall_open` is designed to hide malicious objects. When the object to be opened matches a malicious name (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"", ""reverse_shell""), the `new_syscall_open` function returns `NULL`. This prevents the malicious object from being displayed or accessed, effectively hiding its existence. If the object does not match a malicious name, the function then calls the normal, original `old_syscall_open` function to proceed with the legitimate operation."
What is `old_syscall_open` and when is it called in the hijacking scenario?,"`old_syscall_open` refers to the original, legitimate `syscall_open` function whose pointer was stored before the system-call table was hijacked. In the hijacking scenario, `old_syscall_open` is called by `new_syscall_open` when the object being opened does *not* match a malicious name. This ensures that normal, non-malicious operations proceed as expected, while malicious objects are hidden."
How does the code snippet demonstrate the redirection of `syscall_open`?,"The code snippet demonstrates the redirection of `syscall_open` by first storing the original address of `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` (which points to the original `syscall_open`) into `old_syscall_open`. Then, it overwrites `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` with the address of `new_syscall_open()`, effectively making future calls to `syscall_open` execute `new_syscall_open` instead of the original function."
What are some examples of `malicious_object_name` listed in the code?,"Some examples of `malicious_object_name` listed in the code are ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"", and ""reverse_shell"". These are strings that `new_syscall_open` checks against the name of the object being opened to determine if it should be hidden from the system or user."
What is the purpose of the `strstr` function call within `new_syscall_open`?,"The purpose of the `strstr` function call within `new_syscall_open` is to check if the `object_name` (the name of the file or process being opened) contains any of the predefined `malicious_object_name` strings. If a match is found, indicating a malicious object, the function proceeds to hide it by returning `NULL`, preventing its detection."
"Explain the concept of ""kernel region"" in the context of system call table hijacking.","The ""kernel region"" is a protected memory area where the operating system's core components, including the system call table, reside. In the context of system call table hijacking, a rootkit must gain access to this privileged region to modify the pointers within the system call table, thereby redirecting system calls to its own malicious code and gaining control over system operations."
"Besides hijacking the system-call table, what is another method a rootkit can use to compromise system call functions?","Besides hijacking the system-call table, a rootkit can also directly change the system call function itself. This involves modifying the actual executable code of the system call function in memory, rather than just altering its pointer in a table."
"Describe the specific technique used to directly change a system call function, using `syscall_open` as an example.","The specific technique used to directly change a system call function involves replacing the first 7 bytes of the target system call, such as `syscall_open`, with a jump instruction to a malicious function, for example, `malicious_open`. This `new_syscall_code` effectively diverts the execution flow to the attacker's code when `syscall_open` is invoked."
"How does the faked system call, created by directly changing the function, ensure the original system call can still be executed?","The faked system call, created by directly changing the function, ensures the original system call can still be executed by first issuing its malicious function, then restoring the original system call's first 7 bytes (which were saved as `old_syscall_code`) back into its memory location, and finally calling the correct, original system call. This allows the malicious code to execute and then transparently pass control to the legitimate function."
What is the role of `malicious_open` in the direct system call function compromise method?,"In the direct system call function compromise method, `malicious_open` is the function that contains the attacker's malicious code. When the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` are replaced with a jump to `malicious_open`, `malicious_open` is executed first. After performing its malicious actions, it is responsible for restoring the original `syscall_open` code and then calling it to maintain system functionality and avoid detection."
Explain the purpose of `old_syscall_code` in the context of directly changing system call functions.,"The purpose of `old_syscall_code` in the context of directly changing system call functions is to store the original first 7 bytes of the legitimate system call function (e.g., `syscall_open`) before they are overwritten by the jump instruction to `malicious_open`. This saved code is crucial because it allows `malicious_open` to restore the original function's entry point before calling it, ensuring the system call can eventually execute its intended, legitimate operation."
What does the `memncpy` function do in the provided code snippet for compromising system call functions?,"The `memncpy` function in the provided code snippet is used for memory copying. Specifically, it copies a specified number of bytes from a source memory location to a destination memory location. For instance, `memncpy(old_syscall_code, syscall_open, 7)` copies the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` into `old_syscall_code`, and `memncpy(syscall_open, new_syscall_code, 7)` overwrites the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with the `new_syscall_code`."
What is `new_syscall_code` composed of in the example of direct function compromise?,"In the example of direct function compromise, `new_syscall_code` is composed of a sequence of bytes that represent a jump instruction. Specifically, it includes `""\xbd""`, followed by the 4 bytes of `pt` (which holds the address of `malicious_open`), and then `""\xff"",""\xe5""`. This sequence forms a `movl %pt, %ebp` instruction followed by a `jmp %ebp` instruction, effectively creating a jump to the `malicious_open` function."
How does the `malicious_open` function ensure the system's stability after executing its malicious code?,"The `malicious_open` function ensures the system's stability after executing its malicious code by restoring the original system call's entry point. It does this by copying `old_syscall_code` (the saved first 7 bytes of the original `syscall_open`) back into `syscall_open`, and then it calls the now-restored original `syscall_open(object_name)` to complete the legitimate operation, thus maintaining system functionality."
"What is the significance of replacing only the ""first 7 bytes"" of `syscall_open`?","The significance of replacing only the ""first 7 bytes"" of `syscall_open` is that this specific length is sufficient to insert a jump instruction (`movl %pt, %ebp` and `jmp %ebp`) that redirects execution to `malicious_open`. This minimal modification allows the rootkit to hijack the function's entry point while preserving the rest of the original function's code, which can then be called by `malicious_open` after its malicious actions are completed."
What is the purpose of `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` in the context of compromising system call functions?,"In the context of compromising system call functions, `syscall_addr[__NR_open]` represents the memory address of the `syscall_open` function within the system call table. This address is crucial because it is where the rootkit targets its modifications, either by changing the pointer in the table itself (as in page 3) or by directly modifying the code at this address (as in page 4) to achieve its malicious goals."
Compare and contrast the two methods rootkits use to compromise system calls as described in the document.,"The document describes two methods rootkits use to compromise system calls:\n1.  **Hijacking the System-call Table:** This method involves changing the pointers of specific entries in the system-call table. Instead of pointing to the original system call function, the pointer is redirected to the attacker's malicious code (e.g., `new_syscall_open`). The malicious function then decides whether to hide an object or call the original function (`old_syscall_open`).\n2.  **Directly Changing the System Call Function:** This method involves modifying the actual code of the system call function in memory. Specifically, the first few bytes (e.g., 7 bytes) of the original system call (e.g., `syscall_open`) are replaced with a jump instruction that redirects execution to a malicious function (e.g., `malicious_open`). The malicious function then executes its code, restores the original bytes of the system call, and finally calls the legitimate system call.\n\nBoth methods aim to execute attacker's code when a legitimate system call is invoked. The key difference lies in *where* the modification occurs: the first method alters the *pointer* in a table, while the second method alters the *code* of the function itself. The direct modification method requires saving and restoring the original function's prologue to ensure the original function can still be called."
What is the overall objective of a rootkit when it compromises system calls?,"The overall objective of a rootkit when it compromises system calls is to gain control over system operations, execute arbitrary malicious code, and hide its presence from detection. By intercepting and manipulating system calls, the rootkit can filter information, conceal malicious processes or files, and maintain persistence on the compromised system without being easily discovered."
Why is the kernel region a target for rootkit attacks?,"The kernel region is a target for rootkit attacks because it is the most privileged part of the operating system, containing critical data structures like the system call table and the code for system call functions. By gaining access to and modifying components within the kernel region, a rootkit can achieve deep system control, bypass security checks, and operate with the highest possible privileges, making it difficult to detect and remove."
How does a rootkit's ability to hide its existence contribute to its effectiveness?,"A rootkit's ability to hide its existence contributes significantly to its effectiveness by making it difficult for users, administrators, and security software to detect its presence. By concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets, the rootkit can operate covertly for extended periods, maintaining persistence on the compromised system and continuing its malicious activities without being discovered and removed."
"What is the significance of `SYS_call` in the `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` API?","`SYS_call` in the `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` API represents the index of the specific system call function that the user-level process wishes to invoke. This index is used by the kernel to look up the corresponding function pointer in the system call table, allowing the system to execute the correct kernel-level service requested by the user process."
"In the context of rootkits, what does ""compromise the computer"" entail?","In the context of rootkits, ""compromise the computer"" entails gaining unauthorized and extensive control over the system. This includes obtaining root privileges, which allows the rootkit to bypass security checks, insert and execute arbitrary malicious code, and hide its existence (e.g., malicious processes, files, network sockets) from being detected, effectively taking over the system's operations and data."
What is the role of `System.map-version` in the provided code examples?,"In the provided code examples, `System.map-version` is a file that is opened to obtain system mapping information. This file is typically used to resolve kernel symbol addresses, allowing the rootkit to locate the memory addresses of critical kernel functions and data structures, such as the system call table (`read_syscall_table`) and specific system call functions like `syscall_open`, which are necessary for the rootkit's operations."
"How does a rootkit leverage the concept of ""pointers"" in the system call table hijacking method?","A rootkit leverages the concept of ""pointers"" in the system call table hijacking method by changing the values of these pointers. The system call table is a collection of pointers, each pointing to a specific system call function. By modifying a pointer to point to the attacker's malicious code instead of the original function, the rootkit redirects the execution flow of legitimate system calls to its own code."
Why are buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities mentioned as ways to gain root privileges?,"Buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities are mentioned as ways to gain root privileges because they are common types of software flaws that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or manipulate memory. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to elevate their privileges to root, which is a necessary step for deploying and operating a rootkit with full system control."
"What is the primary difference in how the original system call is handled after the malicious code executes, between the ""hijack system-call table"" and ""compromise system call functions"" methods?","In the ""hijack system-call table"" method, after the malicious `new_syscall_open` code executes (and if the object is not malicious), it directly calls the `old_syscall_open` function, which is a stored pointer to the original system call. In the ""compromise system call functions"" method, after the malicious `malicious_open` code executes, it first *restores the original first 7 bytes* of the `syscall_open` function's code in memory, and *then* calls the now-restored `syscall_open` function. The key difference is the restoration of the original function's code in the latter method before calling it, whereas the former relies on a stored pointer to the original function."
