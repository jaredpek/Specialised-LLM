Define a system call.,"A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. The kernel level is the core, privileged part of the operating system that manages system resources and provides essential services, while a user-level process is an application or program running in user space, which has limited direct access to system resources."
What is the purpose of a system call?,"The primary purpose of a system call is to provide a controlled and secure way for user-level processes to interact with the kernel level. This interaction allows user processes to access system resources and perform privileged operations, such as process control, file management, and device management, which they cannot do directly due to security and stability reasons."
List the types of functions or services that a system call allows a user-level process to request from the kernel level.,"A system call allows a user-level process to request various types of functions or services from the kernel level, including:
- Process control: Managing the execution and state of processes.
- File management: Handling operations related to files, such as reading, writing, and opening.
- Device management: Controlling and interacting with hardware devices."
Explain the role of the system call table.,"The system call table is a crucial component located in the kernel region. Its role is to serve as a table of pointers, where each pointer corresponds to a different system call function. When a user process issues a system call, the kernel uses this table to find the address of the appropriate system call function to execute, effectively mapping a system call index to its corresponding kernel function."
"Describe the process a user process follows to issue a system call, including the API used.","To issue a system call, a user process passes the index of the desired system call and any necessary parameters to the kernel. This is typically done using a specific Application Programming Interface (API). The document provides an example of such an API: `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`. Here, `SYS_call` represents the index of the system call, and `arg1`, `arg2`, etc., are the arguments required by that specific system call function."
What does the `syscall()` API typically include as parameters?,"The `syscall()` API typically includes the index of the system call itself, denoted as `SYS_call`, and a variable number of additional parameters, such as `arg1`, `arg2`, and so on. These additional parameters are specific to the function being requested and provide the necessary data or context for the kernel to perform the requested service."
Provide examples of specific system call functions that might be referenced in a system call table.,"The system call table contains pointers to various system call functions. Examples of specific system call functions that might be referenced include:
- `sys_waitpid`: Used for waiting for process state changes.
- `sys_exit`: Used for terminating the current process.
- `sys_fork`: Used for creating a new process.
- `sys_read`: Used for reading data from a file or device.
- `sys_write`: Used for writing data to a file or device.
- `sys_open`: Used for opening a file or device.
- `sys_close`: Used for closing a file or device."
Differentiate between a user-level process and the kernel level in the context of system calls.,"In the context of system calls, a user-level process refers to an application or program that operates in user space, which is a restricted memory area with limited direct access to hardware and system resources. The kernel level, on the other hand, is the privileged core of the operating system that has full access to all system resources. System calls act as the controlled interface, allowing user-level processes to request services from the kernel level without directly accessing its privileged memory or functions, thus maintaining system stability and security."
How does a system call act as an interface?,"A system call acts as an interface by providing a defined and standardized mechanism through which user-level processes can request functions or services from the kernel level. This interface abstracts the complexities of direct hardware interaction and privileged operations, allowing user programs to perform tasks like file I/O or process creation without needing to understand the intricate details of how the kernel accomplishes them. It serves as a bridge between the less privileged user space and the highly privileged kernel space."
What is the significance of pointers in the kernel region for system calls?,"Pointers in the kernel region are significant for system calls because they form the system call table. This table is a collection of pointers, each pointing to the memory address of a specific system call function within the kernel. When a user process initiates a system call, the kernel uses the system call's index to look up the corresponding pointer in this table, which then directs the execution flow to the correct system call function. This mechanism allows for efficient and organized dispatching of system call requests."
What is a rootkit?,"A rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. Root privileges grant the highest level of access and control over a system, allowing the rootkit to operate with virtually no restrictions."
What kind of privileges does a rootkit obtain?,"A rootkit obtains root privileges. Root privileges are the highest level of administrative access on a system, allowing the user or, in this case, the malware, to bypass security checks and perform any action on the system without restriction."
Describe the capabilities of a root user.,"A root user possesses extensive capabilities because they do not go through any security checks. This allows a root user to perform any actions to the system, including modifying critical system files, installing software, accessing all data, and generally having complete control over the operating system and its resources."
How does a rootkit compromise a computer once it has root privileges?,"Once a rootkit obtains root privileges, it can compromise a computer by performing several malicious actions. These include inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code directly in the system's code path, and hiding its existence, such as malicious processes, files, and network sockets, from being detected. By operating with root privileges, the rootkit can manipulate core system functions and data without being constrained by typical security mechanisms."
Explain how a rootkit hides its existence.,"A rootkit hides its existence by manipulating system components to conceal its presence from detection. This can involve hiding malicious processes, files, and network sockets. By operating with root privileges, the rootkit can modify system utilities or kernel functions that are responsible for listing these items, making it appear as though the malicious components do not exist."
What are some common ways an attacker can gain root privileges for a rootkit?,An attacker can gain root privileges for a rootkit by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software stack. These vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the system's code that can be leveraged to elevate privileges. Examples of such vulnerabilities include buffer overflows and format string bugs.
"Define ""vulnerabilities in the software stack"" in the context of gaining root privileges.","""Vulnerabilities in the software stack"" refer to flaws or weaknesses in the code of software applications or the operating system itself. In the context of gaining root privileges, these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or bypass security mechanisms, thereby elevating their access level from a regular user to a root user. Examples include buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities."
Provide examples of software stack vulnerabilities mentioned.,"The document mentions specific examples of vulnerabilities in the software stack that attackers can exploit to gain root privileges. These include:
- Buffer overflow: A condition where a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-size buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Format string: A vulnerability that arises when user-supplied input is directly used as the format string argument in functions like `printf`, allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory locations."
What is the primary goal of a rootkit?,"The primary goal of a rootkit is to compromise a computer by obtaining root privileges. Once these privileges are acquired, the rootkit aims to maintain persistent, undetected control over the system, allowing it to execute malicious code and hide its presence from security software and system administrators."
Why is it significant that a root user does not go through security checks?,"It is significant that a root user does not go through security checks because this lack of scrutiny grants unrestricted access and control over the entire system. Without security checks, a root user (or a rootkit operating with root privileges) can perform any action, including modifying critical system files, bypassing access controls, and executing arbitrary code, making it extremely difficult to detect or prevent malicious activities."
How do rootkits hijack the system-call table?,"Rootkits hijack the system-call table by changing the pointers of certain entries within it. The system-call table contains pointers to legitimate system call functions. By altering these pointers, the rootkit redirects calls to specific system functions to its own malicious code instead of the original, legitimate code. This allows the rootkit to intercept and control system operations."
What is the consequence when a rootkit changes pointers in the system-call table?,"When a rootkit changes pointers in the system-call table, the consequence is that any other processes calling those specific system calls will inadvertently execute the attacker's code. Instead of invoking the intended legitimate system function, the system will follow the modified pointer to the rootkit's malicious routine, allowing the attacker to intercept, modify, or hide system behavior."
Describe the specific example of system call hijacking mentioned in the document.,"The document provides an example of system call hijacking involving `syscall_open`. In this scenario, the rootkit redirects the `syscall_open` function, which is typically used by commands like `ps` to display running processes, to a new, malicious function called `new_syscall_open`. This redirection allows the rootkit to control what information is returned when processes attempt to open files or other objects, potentially hiding its own malicious components."
Explain the role of `syscall_open` in the example of system call hijacking.,"In the example of system call hijacking, `syscall_open` is a critical system call used for opening files and other system objects. It is specifically mentioned as being used by the `ps command` to display running processes, implying it's involved in accessing process-related information. The rootkit targets `syscall_open` to intercept and manipulate file and process visibility, thereby hiding its own malicious activities."
How does a rootkit redirect `syscall_open` to `new_syscall_open`?,"A rootkit redirects `syscall_open` to `new_syscall_open` by modifying the system-call table. Specifically, it changes the pointer in the system-call table that originally pointed to the legitimate `syscall_open` function. The code snippet shows this by setting `syscall_addr[__NR_open] = new_syscall_open();`, effectively making the entry for the `open` system call point to the rootkit's custom `new_syscall_open` function."
Detail the logic implemented in `new_syscall_open` to hide malicious activity.,"The `new_syscall_open` function implements logic to hide malicious activity by checking the name of the object being opened. If the `object_name` matches a predefined malicious name (e.g., ""xingyi"", ""bind_shell"", ""reverse_shell""), the function returns `NULL`. This action effectively hides the malicious object from the requesting process. If the `object_name` does not match any malicious names, the function calls the normal, original `old_syscall_open` to proceed with the legitimate operation."
What happens if the object to be opened matches a malicious name in the `new_syscall_open` function?,"If the object to be opened matches a malicious name in the `new_syscall_open` function, the function will return `NULL`. This action is designed to hide the existence of the malicious object from the process that attempted to open it, making it appear as if the object does not exist or cannot be accessed."
What happens if the object to be opened does not match a malicious name in the `new_syscall_open` function?,"If the object to be opened does not match a malicious name in the `new_syscall_open` function, the function proceeds to call the normal `old_syscall_open`. This ensures that legitimate system calls for non-malicious objects continue to function as expected, allowing the system to operate normally while the rootkit selectively hides its own components."
What is the purpose of returning `NULL` when a malicious object name is matched?,"The purpose of returning `NULL` when a malicious object name is matched by `new_syscall_open` is to hide the existence of the malicious process, file, or network socket from being detected. By returning `NULL`, the rootkit makes it appear to the requesting process that the object does not exist or cannot be accessed, effectively concealing its presence within the system."
How does the code snippet demonstrate the modification of the `__NR_open` entry in the system call table?,"The code snippet demonstrates the modification of the `__NR_open` entry in the system call table through two key lines:
1. `old_syscall_open = syscall_addr[__NR_open];`: This line saves the original pointer to the `open` system call function before modification.
2. `syscall_addr[__NR_open] = new_syscall_open();`: This line overwrites the pointer at the `__NR_open` index in the `syscall_addr` (which represents the system call table) with the address of the rootkit's `new_syscall_open` function. This effectively redirects all future calls to `open`."
What are some examples of `malicious_object_name` provided in the code?,"The code snippet provides examples of `malicious_object_name` that the rootkit looks for to hide. These include:
- ""xingyi""
- ""bind_shell""
- ""reverse_shell""
These names likely correspond to files, processes, or other system objects associated with the rootkit's malicious activities."
How does the `ps command` relate to `syscall_open` in the context of the example?,"In the context of the example, the `ps command` is mentioned as using `syscall_open` to display running processes. This implies that when a user executes `ps`, it internally makes calls to `syscall_open` to access information about active processes. By hijacking `syscall_open`, the rootkit can intercept these requests and prevent its own malicious processes from being listed by `ps`, effectively hiding them from the user."
What is `old_syscall_open` in the context of the hijacking example?,"`old_syscall_open` in the context of the hijacking example refers to the original, legitimate `syscall_open` function. Before the rootkit modifies the system call table, it saves the pointer to this original function. This allows the `new_syscall_open` function to call the legitimate `open` functionality when the object being opened is not malicious, ensuring normal system operation for non-targeted items."
"Explain the concept of ""attacker's code"" being executed due to system call table hijacking.","When a rootkit hijacks the system call table, it changes the pointers for specific system calls to point to its ""attacker's code."" This means that whenever a legitimate process attempts to invoke one of these hijacked system calls, the system's execution flow is redirected to the malicious code written by the attacker. This code can then perform various actions, such as hiding files, logging data, or executing other payloads, before potentially calling the original system call or returning a faked result."
How does the `strstr` function likely play a role in `new_syscall_open` based on the provided code?,"Based on the provided code, the `strstr` function likely plays a role in `new_syscall_open` by searching for occurrences of `malicious_object_name` within the `object_name` parameter. The line `if strstr(object_name, malicious_object_name)` suggests that `strstr` is used to determine if the name of the object being opened contains any of the predefined malicious strings. If a match is found, the function proceeds to hide the object."
"What is an alternative method for a rootkit to compromise system call functions, besides hijacking the table?","An alternative method for a rootkit to compromise system call functions, besides hijacking the system call table, is to directly change the system call function itself. This involves modifying the actual executable code of the legitimate system call function in memory, rather than just redirecting its pointer in the table."
"Describe the specific technique used to directly change a system call function, as exemplified with `syscall_open`.","As exemplified with `syscall_open`, the specific technique used to directly change a system call function involves replacing the first 7 bytes of the legitimate `syscall_open` function's code with a jump instruction that redirects execution to a `malicious_open` function. Before this replacement, the original first 7 bytes are saved. The `malicious_open` function then executes its malicious payload, restores the original 7 bytes of `syscall_open`, and finally calls the now-restored legitimate `syscall_open` function."
Explain the purpose of replacing the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with a jump instruction.,"The purpose of replacing the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with a jump instruction is to divert the execution flow to the rootkit's `malicious_open` function whenever `syscall_open` is invoked. These first few bytes typically contain the entry point of the function. By overwriting them with a jump, the rootkit ensures that its malicious code is executed first, allowing it to intercept and control the system call's behavior before potentially allowing the original function to run."
Detail the sequence of actions performed by the `malicious_open` function.,"The `malicious_open` function performs a specific sequence of actions:
1. It first executes a `malicious_function()`, which represents the rootkit's intended malicious payload.
2. After executing its payload, it restores the original system call code by copying the previously saved `old_syscall_code` (the first 7 bytes of the original `syscall_open`) back into the `syscall_open` function's memory location.
3. Finally, it calls the now-restored original `syscall_open(object_name)` function, ensuring that the legitimate operation is eventually performed."
Why does `malicious_open` restore the original system call before calling it?,"`malicious_open` restores the original system call before calling it to ensure that the legitimate functionality of `syscall_open` is eventually executed correctly. If the original code were not restored, calling `syscall_open` again would lead back to `malicious_open` in an infinite loop or cause system instability. By restoring the original bytes, the rootkit allows the system call to complete its intended operation after the malicious actions have been performed, maintaining system stability while still achieving its goals."
What is `old_syscall_code` used for in this method of compromise?,"`old_syscall_code` is used to store the first 7 bytes of the original, legitimate `syscall_open` function's code. This preservation is crucial because after the `malicious_open` function executes its payload, it needs to restore these original bytes back into `syscall_open`'s memory location. This restoration allows the `malicious_open` function to then safely call the legitimate `syscall_open` to complete the requested operation without causing an infinite loop or system crash."
How is the `new_syscall_code` constructed to facilitate the jump to `malicious_open`?,"The `new_syscall_code` is constructed as a 7-byte sequence designed to facilitate a jump to `malicious_open`. It consists of:
- `""\xbd"",pt[0],pt[1],pt[2], pt[3]`: These bytes likely form a `movl %pt, %ebp` instruction, which moves the address of `malicious_open` (stored in `pt`) into a register.
- `""\xff"",""\xe5""`: These bytes form a `jmp %ebp` instruction, which then jumps to the address now held in the `%ebp` register, effectively redirecting execution to `malicious_open`. This sequence creates a direct jump to the malicious function."
What does `malicious_function()` represent in the `malicious_open` function?,"`malicious_function()` in the `malicious_open` function represents the specific malicious payload or actions that the rootkit intends to perform. This could include logging sensitive data, modifying system behavior, creating backdoors, or any other unauthorized operations that the rootkit is designed to execute once it has intercepted the system call."
How does this method ensure that the original system call's functionality is eventually executed?,"This method ensures that the original system call's functionality is eventually executed by temporarily patching the `syscall_open` function, executing the malicious code, and then restoring the original `syscall_open` code before finally calling it. The `malicious_open` function saves the original first 7 bytes, performs its malicious actions, restores those original bytes, and then makes a legitimate call to `syscall_open`. This allows the system call to complete its intended operation after the rootkit has performed its tasks."
What is the significance of `memncpy` in the provided code snippets for compromising system call functions?,"`memncpy` (likely `memcpy` or a similar memory copy function) is significant in the provided code snippets because it is used for manipulating the raw bytes of system call functions in memory. It's used to:
1. Save the original first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` into `old_syscall_code`.
2. Copy the address of `malicious_open` into the `pt` buffer.
3. Overwrite the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` with the `new_syscall_code` (the jump instruction).
4. Restore the original `syscall_open` code from `old_syscall_code` after the malicious function has run. This direct memory manipulation is central to patching the system call function."
"What specific assembly instructions are indicated by `""\xbd"",pt[0],pt[1],pt[2], pt[3], // movl %pt, %ebp ""\xff"",""\xe5"" // jmp %ebp`?","The specific assembly instructions indicated by `""\xbd"",pt[0],pt[1],pt[2], pt[3], // movl %pt, %ebp ""\xff"",""\xe5"" // jmp %ebp` are:
- `movl %pt, %ebp`: This instruction moves the 32-bit value (address) stored in `pt` into the `%ebp` register. `\xbd` is the opcode for `movl` with an immediate operand, and `pt[0]` through `pt[3]` represent the 4-byte address of `malicious_open`.
- `jmp %ebp`: This instruction performs an unconditional jump to the address currently stored in the `%ebp` register. `\xff\xe5` is the opcode sequence for this indirect jump. Together, these instructions create a direct jump to the `malicious_open` function."
How does this direct modification differ from the system call table hijacking method?,"This direct modification method differs from the system call table hijacking method in its approach to redirection. System call table hijacking changes a pointer in a central table, redirecting all calls to a specific system call to the attacker's code. Direct modification, however, alters the actual executable code of the system call function itself, typically at its entry point, to insert a jump to the malicious code. The direct modification method also involves restoring the original code to allow the legitimate function to execute, whereas table hijacking typically just calls the original function through a saved pointer."
What is the role of `syscall_addr` in both methods of system call compromise?,"`syscall_addr` represents the base address or a pointer to the system call table in the kernel region. In both methods of system call compromise:
- In system call table hijacking, `syscall_addr` is directly used to access and modify the pointers within the table (e.g., `syscall_addr[__NR_open] = new_syscall_open();`).
- In direct modification of system call functions, `syscall_addr` is used to obtain the initial address of the `syscall_open` function (e.g., `syscall_open = syscall_addr[__NR_open];`), which is then directly patched in memory. So, `syscall_addr` serves as the entry point to locate the system call functions, whether for table modification or direct code patching."
What is the overall impact of compromising system call functions on system security?,"The overall impact of compromising system call functions on system security is severe. It allows a rootkit to gain deep, persistent control over the operating system. By intercepting and manipulating fundamental operations like file access, process management, and device control, the rootkit can hide its presence, execute arbitrary code, bypass security mechanisms, and potentially exfiltrate data or cause system instability, making the system highly vulnerable and untrustworthy."
How does the `syscall_open = syscall_addr[__NR_open];` line relate to both methods of compromise?,"The line `syscall_open = syscall_addr[__NR_open];` is fundamental to both methods of compromise as it is the mechanism used to obtain the memory address of the `syscall_open` function. In the system call table hijacking method, this line (or a similar operation) would be used to retrieve the original `syscall_open` address before overwriting the table entry with `new_syscall_open`. In the direct modification method, this line explicitly retrieves the address of `syscall_open` from the system call table, allowing the rootkit to then directly patch the code at that memory location. It serves as the initial step to locate the target system call function for either type of manipulation."
