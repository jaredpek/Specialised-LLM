What is the primary goal when addressing system complexity in security?,The primary goal when addressing system complexity in security is to provide a protected environment for data and their processing.
What security requirements are necessary for a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram?,"For a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram, the necessary security requirement is physical security. Physical security refers to measures designed to protect physical assets from unauthorized access or damage."
How do the security requirements change for a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs compared to a monoprogram system?,"For a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs, the security requirements expand to include physical security and process protection. Process protection refers to mechanisms that ensure one program's execution does not interfere with or compromise another program or the operating system."
What additional security measures are needed for a standalone computer supporting multiple users?,"A standalone computer supporting multiple users requires physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. Data protection involves safeguarding data from corruption, compromise, or loss, while user authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a system."
Describe the full set of security requirements for a networked computer system.,"A networked computer system demands a comprehensive set of security requirements: physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection. Communication protection refers to measures that secure data transmitted over a network, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
What are the main categories of human factors that contribute to insecurity in systems?,"The main categories of human factors that contribute to insecurity in systems are System Users, System Developers, and External Parties."
How can system users introduce insecurity into a system?,"System users can introduce insecurity through misconfiguration, which occurs when security features are not used correctly. Additionally, users may prioritize convenience and attempt to disable security configurations they perceive as inconvenient."
What are the ways system developers can contribute to system insecurity?,"System developers can contribute to system insecurity if security features are not designed correctly or if security components are not implemented correctly. Furthermore, developers, being human, are prone to making mistakes during the design and implementation processes."
Explain how external parties can lead to insecurity.,"External parties can lead to insecurity by manipulating an individual's trust for profit, a practice commonly known as social engineering. Social engineering involves psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information."
What are the core components of a Threat Model in cyber security?,"The core components of a Threat Model in cyber security include the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the Attacker's assumption, and Security properties."
What is the purpose of a Threat Model?,The purpose of a Threat Model is to describe the adversaries and threats that are under consideration for a given system.
What aspects are described within a Threat Model regarding trusted and untrusted entities?,"A Threat Model describes what is trusted and what is not trusted, referring to the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). For untrusted entities, it details their resources, capabilities, knowledge, and the actions they can perform."
What role do security properties play in a Threat Model?,"In a Threat Model, security properties define what the system aims to achieve in terms of security. These properties specify the desired secure behavior and characteristics of the system."
"Define ""Trust"" in the context of cyber security.","In the context of cyber security, ""Trust"" is defined as the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a certain manner."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected to do"" in terms of trust.","Examples of what an entity is ""expected to do"" include anti-malware detecting malicious programs and a system preventing illegal account logins."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected not to do"" in terms of trust.","Examples of what an entity is ""expected not to do"" include a website not exposing private data to third parties and an application not injecting a virus into a system."
Why is it crucial to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is crucial to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities are trusted. If trust is not clearly established, the designed security solutions may fail in practice."
What is the definition of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"A Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, such as software, operating systems (OS), firmware, and hardware, that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system."
What is the implication of components being outside the TCB?,"The implication of components being outside the TCB is that they can be malicious and misbehave, posing a potential threat to the system's security."
What are the two main considerations when designing a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution, the two main considerations concerning the TCB are: assuming all components inside the TCB are secure with valid justifications, and preventing any damages from components outside of the TCB."
"What is the ""Unbypassable"" principle in TCB design?","The ""Unbypassable"" principle, also known as completeness, in TCB design states that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB."
"Explain the ""Tamper-resistant"" principle in TCB design.","The ""Tamper-resistant"" principle, also known as security, in TCB design dictates that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or state."
"What does the ""Verifiable"" principle mean for TCB design?","The ""Verifiable"" principle, also known as correctness, for TCB design means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This ensures that the TCB functions as intended and securely."
What is the advantage of having a smaller TCB?,"The advantage of having a smaller TCB is that the system becomes more trustworthy and easier to verify, as fewer assumptions need to be made, which might otherwise be violated. This aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle."
What is a challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,A challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is that it becomes more challenging because more malicious entities need to be considered outside the trusted boundary.
What are the two main types of attackers based on their actions?,The two main types of attackers based on their actions are active attackers and passive attackers.
"Describe an ""Active"" attacker.","An ""Active"" attacker is one who manipulates or disrupts systems, for example, by modifying data or injecting code."
"Describe a ""Passive"" attacker.","A ""Passive"" attacker is one who observes and gathers information without interfering with the system."
What types of knowledge might an attacker possess?,"An attacker might possess knowledge of the system's design, architecture, and source code. Alternatively, an attacker might lack detailed knowledge and have to rely on probing or trial and error to gain information."
What factors define an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's capability is defined by how much computing resources they can leverage, what parts of the system they can interact with, and whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly."
What is the definition of physical security in the context of computer systems?,Physical security refers to measures designed to protect the physical components of computer systems from unauthorized access or damage.
What is process protection?,"Process protection refers to security mechanisms that ensure the isolation and integrity of individual processes running on a computer system, preventing them from interfering with each other or the operating system."
What does data protection entail?,"Data protection entails safeguarding data from unauthorized access, corruption, compromise, or loss, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
What is user authentication?,"User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a system or resource, typically through credentials like usernames and passwords."
What is communication protection?,"Communication protection refers to security measures applied to data transmitted over a network to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during transit."
What is misconfiguration in the context of system users and security?,"Misconfiguration, in the context of system users and security, occurs when security features are not used correctly, leading to vulnerabilities or reduced protection."
How does user convenience sometimes conflict with security?,"User convenience sometimes conflicts with security when users, prioritizing ease of use, try to disable security configurations that they find inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses."
What is social engineering?,"Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human psychology to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, often for profit."
"What are ""Security properties"" in the context of a threat model?","""Security properties"" in the context of a threat model are the specific attributes or characteristics that a system aims to achieve to be considered secure, such as confidentiality, integrity, or availability."
Why is it important to prevent damages from components outside the TCB?,"It is important to prevent damages from components outside the TCB because these components are not trusted and can be malicious or misbehave, potentially compromising the entire system if not properly contained."
What does the KISS principle stand for and how does it relate to TCB size?,"The KISS principle stands for ""Keep It Simple, Stupid."" It relates to TCB size by suggesting that a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces complexity and the number of assumptions that could be violated."
"What is the significance of ""valid justifications"" when assuming TCB components are secure?","The significance of ""valid justifications"" when assuming TCB components are secure is that this assumption must be backed by concrete evidence or rigorous analysis, rather than blind faith, to ensure the foundational security of the system."
How does system complexity relate to insecurity?,"System complexity leads to insecurity because as systems become more intricate with more users, programs, and network connections, the number of potential vulnerabilities and required security measures increases, making it harder to provide a fully protected environment."
What is the difference in security needs between a standalone computer with a single user running a multiprogram and a standalone computer with multiple users?,"A standalone computer with a single user running a multiprogram requires physical security and process protection. In contrast, a standalone computer with multiple users additionally requires data protection and user authentication, due to the need to isolate and manage access to data for different users."
"What are the three main categories mentioned under ""Basics of Cyber Security""?","The three main categories mentioned under ""Basics of Cyber Security"" are Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security."
What does an attacker's assumption typically cover?,"An attacker's assumption typically covers the type of attacker (active or passive), the attacker's knowledge (e.g., system design or lack thereof), and the attacker's capability (e.g., computing resources, system interaction, time constraints)."
"Why is it important for security solutions to consider what an entity is ""expected not to do""?","It is important for security solutions to consider what an entity is ""expected not to do"" because this defines the boundaries of acceptable behavior and helps in designing controls to prevent malicious or unintended actions, such as data exposure or virus injection."
"How does the concept of ""trust"" influence the design of security solutions?","The concept of ""trust"" profoundly influences the design of security solutions by requiring a clear definition of what components or entities are trusted. Without this clarity, security solutions may fail in practice because the foundational assumptions about system behavior are not well-established."
What are the implications if security components are not implemented correctly by developers?,"If security components are not implemented correctly by developers, it can lead to significant vulnerabilities, even if the design was sound. Incorrect implementation can introduce flaws that attackers can exploit, compromising the system's overall security."
"How does the need for ""Communication protection"" arise in networked computers?","The need for ""Communication protection"" arises in networked computers because data is transmitted between different machines over a network. This transmission introduces risks such as eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized access, which communication protection measures are designed to mitigate."
