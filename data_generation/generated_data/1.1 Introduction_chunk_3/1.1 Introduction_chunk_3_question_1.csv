What security measures are typically required for a standalone computer used by a single user running a monoprogram?,"For a standalone computer used by a single user running a monoprogram, the primary security measure required is physical security. Physical security refers to the protection of hardware, software, and data from physical threats, such as theft, damage, or unauthorized access to the physical device itself."
Describe the security requirements for a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs.,"A standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs requires both physical security and process protection. Physical security involves safeguarding the hardware, software, and data from physical threats. Process protection ensures that different programs or processes running concurrently on the system do not interfere with each other or access unauthorized resources, maintaining the integrity and isolation of each process."
What security considerations are necessary for a standalone computer with multiple users?,"For a standalone computer with multiple users, the necessary security considerations include physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. Physical security protects the system from physical threats. Process protection isolates different processes to prevent interference. Data protection safeguards data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. User authentication verifies the identity of users attempting to access the system, ensuring only authorized individuals can log in."
Explain the security requirements for a networked computer system.,"A networked computer system has the most extensive security requirements, including physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection. Physical security protects the hardware. Process protection isolates running programs. Data protection secures information from unauthorized access or alteration. User authentication verifies user identities. Communication protection safeguards data transmitted over the network from eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized interception during transit."
How does system complexity relate to insecurity in computer systems?,"System complexity directly leads to insecurity by increasing the number of potential vulnerabilities and the difficulty in providing a protected environment for data and their processing. As systems evolve from simple standalone single-user monoprogram setups to complex networked multi-user environments, the range of necessary security measures expands significantly, encompassing physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection, each adding layers of complexity that can introduce new points of failure or attack."
What are the ways in which system users contribute to insecurity?,"System users contribute to insecurity in two primary ways: first, by not using security features correctly, which often manifests as misconfiguration; and second, by prioritizing convenience, leading them to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses."
How do system developers introduce insecurity into systems?,"System developers introduce insecurity into systems through two main avenues: first, by incorrectly designing security features or improperly implementing security components; and second, because developers are human and, as such, are prone to making mistakes during the design and implementation processes."
In what ways do external parties contribute to system insecurity?,"External parties contribute to system insecurity primarily by manipulating an individual's trust for profit. A common example of this is social engineering, where attackers exploit human psychology and trust to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security."
What are the main components of a Threat Model in cyber security?,"The main components of a Threat Model in cyber security are the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the attacker's assumptions, and the security properties the system aims to achieve. The Threat Model describes the adversaries and threats under consideration for a given system."
Define a Threat Model in the context of cyber security.,"A Threat Model in the context of cyber security is a structured approach used to describe the adversaries and threats that a system might face. It involves identifying what parts of the system are trusted and what are not (the Trusted Computing Base or TCB), understanding the resources, capabilities, knowledge, and potential actions of untrusted entities, and clearly defining the security properties that the system aims to achieve."
What is meant by 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' within a Threat Model?,"Within a Threat Model, the 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' refers to the set of components within a computer system that are considered trusted. These are the parts of the system that are assumed to be secure and whose correct operation is essential for the overall security of the cyber system. The Threat Model explicitly defines what is trusted and what is not trusted, with components outside the TCB being considered untrusted."
What information about untrusted entities is considered in a Threat Model?,"In a Threat Model, for untrusted entities, the information considered includes their resources, capabilities, and knowledge. It also details what specific actions these untrusted entities are capable of performing against the system. This understanding helps in assessing potential threats and designing appropriate defenses."
What role do 'Security properties' play in a Threat Model?,"Security properties play a crucial role in a Threat Model by defining the specific security goals that the system aims to achieve. These properties articulate what the system should protect against and what secure behavior looks like, guiding the design and evaluation of security mechanisms to counter the identified threats and adversaries."
What is the definition of 'Trust' in a cyber system?,"In a cyber system, 'Trust' is defined as the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a certain manner. This expectation encompasses both what the entity is anticipated to do (e.g., anti-malware detecting malicious programs, a system preventing illegal account logins) and what the entity is expected not to do (e.g., a website not exposing private data, an application not injecting viruses)."
Why is it important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be effectively established if no entities are trusted. Without a clear understanding of what components or entities are reliable, the designed security solutions may fail in practice, leaving the system vulnerable to attacks or misbehavior."
Provide examples of what an entity is expected to do in a trusted cyber system.,"In a trusted cyber system, an entity is expected to perform actions such as anti-malware detecting malicious programs or a system preventing illegal account logins. These are positive behaviors that contribute to the overall security and integrity of the system."
Provide examples of what an entity is expected not to do in a trusted cyber system.,"In a trusted cyber system, an entity is expected not to perform actions that compromise security or privacy. Examples include a website not exposing private data to third parties, and an application not injecting viruses into the system. These are negative behaviors that trust aims to prevent."
What is the definition of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, which can include software, operating systems (OS), firmware, and hardware, that must be trusted to ensure the overall security of a cyber system. These components are critical because their correct and secure operation is fundamental to the system's integrity."
What is the implication of components being outside the TCB?,"The implication of components being outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that they can be malicious and misbehave. Therefore, security solutions must be designed to account for the potential untrustworthiness of these external components and prevent them from compromising the system."
What are the two key considerations when designing a security solution in relation to the TCB?,"When designing a security solution in relation to the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), there are two key considerations: first, to assume that all components inside the TCB are secure, provided with valid justifications; and second, to prevent any damages from components that are outside of the TCB, as these are considered potentially malicious."
Explain the 'Unbypassable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Unbypassable' principle, also known as completeness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design dictates that there must be no possible way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations and data paths must be mediated and protected by the TCB, ensuring that its security controls cannot be circumvented."
What does 'Tamper-resistant' mean for TCB design?,"For Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design, 'Tamper-resistant,' also referred to as security, means that the TCB should be protected against other parts of the system that are outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or its internal state, thereby preserving the integrity and reliability of the trusted components."
Describe the 'Verifiable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Verifiable' principle, also known as correctness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis and proof, allowing for assurance that it functions as intended and meets its security specifications."
What is the advantage of having a smaller TCB?,"The advantage of having a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that it makes the system more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle."
What is the challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"The challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that it becomes more difficult. This is because a smaller TCB implies that more entities within the system are considered potentially malicious, requiring more robust and comprehensive security mechanisms to protect against them."
What are the three main categories of 'Attacker's Assumption'?,"The three main categories of 'Attacker's Assumption' are the type of attacker, the attacker's knowledge, and the attacker's capability. These categories help in understanding the potential threats and designing appropriate security measures."
Differentiate between an 'Active' and 'Passive' type of attacker.,"An 'Active' type of attacker is one who manipulates or disrupts systems, for example, by modifying data or injecting code. In contrast, a 'Passive' type of attacker focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation."
What are the two primary aspects of an 'Attacker's knowledge' considered in security?,"The two primary aspects of an 'Attacker's knowledge' considered in security are whether the attacker knows the system's design, architecture, source code, and similar details, or if they lack detailed knowledge and must rely on probing, trial, and error to understand the system."
What factors are included in an 'Attacker's capability'?,"An 'Attacker's capability' includes several factors: how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, and whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly to achieve their objectives."
What is the overall goal when providing a protected environment for data and their processing?,"The overall goal when providing a protected environment for data and their processing is to mitigate the insecurity that arises from system complexity. This involves implementing various security measures appropriate to the system's configuration, such as physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection, to safeguard assets from threats."
What is 'Physical security' in the context of computer systems?,"'Physical security' in the context of computer systems refers to the protection of the physical hardware, infrastructure, and environment where the computer system resides. This includes measures to prevent unauthorized physical access, theft, damage, or tampering with the computing equipment and its components."
What is 'Process protection' in computer security?,"'Process protection' in computer security is a mechanism designed to isolate and safeguard individual processes or programs running on a system. Its purpose is to prevent one process from interfering with another, accessing unauthorized memory regions, or compromising the integrity of other running applications or the operating system itself."
What does 'Data protection' entail in a multi-user computer system?,"'Data protection' in a multi-user computer system entails safeguarding information from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or destruction. This ensures that only authorized users or processes can interact with specific data, maintaining its confidentiality, integrity, and availability within the shared environment."
What is the purpose of 'User authentication'?,"The purpose of 'User authentication' is to verify the identity of a user attempting to access a computer system or resource. It ensures that only legitimate and authorized individuals can gain entry, typically by requiring credentials such as usernames and passwords, or other forms of identification."
What is 'Communication protection' in a networked computer system?,"'Communication protection' in a networked computer system refers to the security measures implemented to safeguard data as it is transmitted across a network. This includes protecting against eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized interception, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of information exchanged between connected devices."
Why are security features sometimes not used correctly by system users?,"Security features are sometimes not used correctly by system users due to misconfiguration. This occurs when users either do not understand how to properly set up or utilize the security controls, or they make incorrect choices during the configuration process, inadvertently weakening the system's defenses."
How does the desire for convenience impact security configurations by users?,"The desire for convenience significantly impacts security configurations by users because they may try to disable security settings that they perceive as inconvenient. This trade-off between ease of use and security often leads to users bypassing or weakening protective measures, thereby increasing system vulnerability."
What are the consequences when security features are not designed correctly by developers?,"When security features are not designed correctly by developers, the consequence is that the security components themselves are not implemented correctly. This fundamental flaw at the design stage leads to inherent vulnerabilities in the system, regardless of how well other aspects are handled, making the system susceptible to attacks."
"Why is it stated that 'Developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes' in the context of insecurity?","It is stated that 'Developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes' in the context of insecurity to highlight that human error is an inherent factor contributing to system vulnerabilities. Even with good intentions, developers can introduce flaws, bugs, or oversights in security design and implementation, leading to potential exploits."
What is 'social engineering' and how does it relate to external parties causing insecurity?,"'Social engineering' is a manipulative technique used by external parties to exploit human psychology and trust. It relates to external parties causing insecurity because it allows them to manipulate an individual's trust for profit, often leading victims to unknowingly reveal confidential information or grant access to systems, thereby bypassing technical security controls."
What are 'Security Strategies' in cyber security?,"'Security Strategies' in cyber security refer to the overarching plans and approaches adopted to protect information systems and data from threats. While the document lists it as a basic concept, it does not provide further details on specific strategies."
What are 'Design Principles of Computer Security'?,"'Design Principles of Computer Security' are fundamental guidelines and best practices that inform the creation of secure computer systems. While the document lists it as a basic concept, it does not provide further details on specific principles beyond those related to TCB design."
How does the diagram on page 4 illustrate the components of a Threat Model?,"The diagram on page 4 illustrates the components of a Threat Model by showing 'Attackers' assumptions' and 'Security Properties' as external considerations influencing the 'Computer System'. Within the 'Computer System', the 'TCB' (Trusted Computing Base) is depicted as a core, trusted component, while the rest of the system is implicitly untrusted. This visual representation connects the attacker's perspective and desired security outcomes with the system's trusted and untrusted parts."
What is the significance of 'valid justifications' when assuming TCB components are secure?,"The significance of 'valid justifications' when assuming Trusted Computing Base (TCB) components are secure is that it requires a rigorous basis for trust. It means that the assumption of security for TCB components is not arbitrary but must be supported by evidence, analysis, or formal verification, ensuring that the trust placed in these critical components is well-founded and defensible."
How does the KISS principle apply to the size of the TCB?,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle applies to the size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by advocating for a smaller TCB. A smaller TCB is inherently simpler, making it more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions about its components. This reduces the complexity and potential for vulnerabilities that could arise from violated assumptions."
What is the primary objective of a Threat Model?,"The primary objective of a Threat Model is to describe the adversaries and threats that a system might encounter. This involves identifying trusted and untrusted components, understanding the capabilities of untrusted entities, and defining the security properties the system aims to achieve, all to proactively identify and mitigate potential security risks."
Why is it crucial to prevent damages from components outside the TCB?,"It is crucial to prevent damages from components outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) because these components are not trusted and can be malicious or misbehave. Failing to contain their potential negative actions could compromise the entire system, even if the TCB itself is secure."
What are the implications if a system's TCB is not 'Verifiable'?,"If a system's Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is not 'Verifiable', it implies that its correctness cannot be confirmed. This lack of verifiability means there is no assurance that the TCB operates as intended or meets its security specifications, introducing uncertainty and potential hidden vulnerabilities that could undermine the entire system's security posture."
How does an attacker's computing resources influence their capability?,"An attacker's computing resources significantly influence their capability by determining the scale and complexity of attacks they can launch. Greater resources allow for more sophisticated attacks, such as brute-force password cracking, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or complex cryptographic computations, which might be impossible with limited resources."
What is the impact of an attacker having 'unlimited time' versus needing to 'act quickly'?,"The impact of an attacker having 'unlimited time' versus needing to 'act quickly' is substantial. Unlimited time allows an attacker to conduct more thorough reconnaissance, persistent probing, and complex, multi-stage attacks without fear of detection or interruption. Conversely, an attacker needing to act quickly is constrained, often forced to use simpler, less stealthy methods, or exploit fleeting opportunities, which can limit the scope and success of their attack."
What kind of information would an attacker with detailed knowledge of a system possess?,"An attacker with detailed knowledge of a system would possess information such as the system's design, architecture, and source code. This level of insight allows them to identify specific vulnerabilities, understand internal workings, and craft highly targeted and effective exploits."
