Analyse the security measures required for a standalone computer with a single user and a monoprogram.,"For a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram, the primary security measure required is physical security. Physical security refers to the protection of hardware, software, and data from physical threats, such as unauthorized access, theft, or damage."
What additional security considerations arise when a standalone computer supports a single user but multiple programs?,"When a standalone computer supports a single user running multiple programs, the security considerations expand beyond just physical security to include process protection. Process protection involves mechanisms that ensure one program's execution does not interfere with or compromise the integrity or confidentiality of another program or the operating system."
Describe the security requirements for a standalone computer used by multiple users.,"A standalone computer utilized by multiple users necessitates a more comprehensive set of security measures. These include physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. Physical security safeguards the hardware and data from physical threats. Process protection ensures that different programs or user processes do not interfere with each other. Data protection involves securing data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like passwords, before granting access to the system."
What are the full range of security measures needed for a networked computer environment?,"In a networked computer environment, the full range of security measures required includes physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection. Physical security protects the physical hardware. Process protection isolates different running programs or user processes. Data protection secures data from unauthorized access or alteration. User authentication verifies user identities. Communication protection involves securing data as it is transmitted across a network, safeguarding it from eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized interception."
Explain how system complexity influences the necessary security provisions.,"System complexity directly influences the necessary security provisions by increasing the number and type of protections required. As systems evolve from simple standalone single-user monoprogram environments to complex networked multi-user systems, the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities grow. This necessitates a layered approach to security, adding measures such as process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection on top of basic physical security to maintain a protected environment for data and its processing."
What insights can be derived from the analysis of human factors leading to insecurity from the perspective of system users?,"From the perspective of system users, human factors leading to insecurity primarily stem from incorrect usage and a preference for convenience over security. Users may not use security features correctly, leading to misconfiguration, which is an improper or insecure setup of a system or application. Additionally, users might disable security configurations if they perceive them as inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses for ease of use."
Analyse the role of system developers in contributing to system insecurity.,"System developers contribute to insecurity through errors in design and implementation. Security features may not be designed correctly, meaning the fundamental architectural plans for security are flawed. Furthermore, security components might not be implemented correctly, indicating that even if the design is sound, the actual coding or integration of security mechanisms is faulty. Ultimately, developers are humans and, as such, are prone to making mistakes, which can introduce vulnerabilities into the system."
How do external parties contribute to system insecurity?,"External parties contribute to system insecurity primarily through the manipulation of individual trust for profit, a practice commonly known as social engineering. Social engineering is a psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This exploitation of human psychology by external parties can bypass technical security measures by tricking legitimate users into compromising the system."
Define the concept of a Threat Model in cyber security.,"In cyber security, a Threat Model is a structured approach to identify, categorize, and prioritize potential threats to a system. It involves describing the adversaries and threats under consideration by identifying what is trusted and what is not trusted (the Trusted Computing Base or TCB), understanding the resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities, and defining the security properties the system aims to achieve."
What are the key components of a Threat Model as outlined in cyber security basics?,"The key components of a Threat Model in cyber security basics include the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), attacker's assumptions, and security properties. The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to the set of components that are trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. Attacker's assumptions detail the characteristics, knowledge, and capabilities of potential adversaries. Security properties are the specific attributes or goals that the system aims to achieve to maintain its security, such as confidentiality, integrity, or availability."
"Explain the concept of ""Trust"" in the context of cyber systems.","In the context of cyber systems, ""Trust"" refers to the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a predictable and secure manner. This involves defining what the entity is expected to do (e.g., anti-malware detecting malicious programs, system preventing illegal account login) and what it is expected not to do (e.g., a website not exposing private data, an application not injecting viruses). Establishing clear trust boundaries is critical because security cannot be established in a cyber system if no entities are trusted, and unclear trust definitions can lead to security solutions failing in practice."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected to do"" in a trusted cyber system.","In a trusted cyber system, an entity is expected to perform actions that contribute to security. Examples include anti-malware software detecting malicious programs, which are harmful or unwanted software designed to cause damage or gain unauthorized access, and a system preventing illegal account login, which is an unauthorized attempt to access a user account. These expectations define the positive security behaviors of trusted components."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected not to do"" in a trusted cyber system.","In a trusted cyber system, an entity is expected to refrain from actions that compromise security. Examples include a website not exposing private data to third parties, meaning it should protect sensitive user information from unauthorized disclosure, and an application not injecting a virus into your system, which refers to preventing malicious code from being introduced and executed within the system. These expectations define the negative security behaviors that trusted components must avoid."
Why is it important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities are trusted. Without a clear understanding of which components or entities are reliable, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. This clarity helps in identifying the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and in designing effective defenses against untrusted components."
Define the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and its significance in cyber security.,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, which can include software, operating systems (OS), firmware, and hardware, that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. Its significance lies in the fact that components outside the TCB are considered potentially malicious and capable of misbehaving. Therefore, security solutions are designed by assuming components inside the TCB are secure with valid justifications and by preventing any damages from components outside the TCB."
What are the design considerations for a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution, the primary considerations concerning the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are twofold: first, to assume all components inside the TCB are secure, provided there are valid justifications for this trust; and second, to prevent any damages from components that are outside of the TCB. This approach ensures that the core trusted elements are protected and that untrusted elements cannot compromise the system."
"Describe the principle of ""Unbypassable (completeness)"" in TCB design.","The principle of ""Unbypassable (completeness)"" in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations and data paths must go through the TCB, ensuring that its security mechanisms are always enforced and cannot be circumvented by an attacker."
"Explain the ""Tamper-resistant (security)"" principle for TCB design.","The ""Tamper-resistant (security)"" principle for Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. This protection ensures that these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state. Tamper-resistance is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the TCB, as any unauthorized alteration could compromise the entire system's security."
"What does the ""Verifiable (or correctness)"" principle imply for TCB design?","The ""Verifiable (or correctness)"" principle for Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design implies that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This means that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis, testing, or formal methods to prove that it functions as intended and meets its security specifications without flaws or vulnerabilities."
Discuss the relationship between the size of the TCB and system trustworthiness.,"The size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) has a direct relationship with system trustworthiness and verifiability. A system with a smaller TCB is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because fewer assumptions need to be made, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which advocates for simplicity in design. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging as it requires considering a greater number of potentially malicious entities outside the trusted core."
"How does the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle apply to the size of the TCB?","The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle applies to the size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by advocating for a smaller TCB. A smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces the number of components that need to be trusted, thereby minimizing the assumptions that could potentially be violated. This simplicity in the trusted core makes the system's security easier to analyze and assure."
What are the challenges associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"While a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) can lead to greater trustworthiness and easier verification, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB presents challenges. Specifically, it requires considering more malicious entities that exist outside the smaller trusted core. This means the security mechanisms must be robust enough to prevent a wider range of potential attacks from a larger untrusted environment."
"Differentiate between an ""Active"" and a ""Passive"" attacker.","An ""Active"" attacker is a type of adversary who aims to manipulate or disrupt systems, for example, by modifying data or injecting code. This involves direct interaction and alteration of the system's state or information flow. In contrast, a ""Passive"" attacker focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. Their goal is to collect data, such as network traffic or system configurations, without leaving a trace of their presence or altering the system's operation."
"What types of actions characterize an ""Active"" attacker?","An ""Active"" attacker is characterized by actions that involve direct manipulation or disruption of systems. These actions include modifying data, which means altering information stored or transmitted within the system, and injecting code, which involves introducing malicious programming instructions into a system to execute unauthorized functions."
"What is the primary objective of a ""Passive"" attacker?","The primary objective of a ""Passive"" attacker is observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. This means they aim to collect data, such as sensitive communications or system configurations, without altering the system's state or operations, thereby remaining undetected."
"Analyse the different levels of ""Attacker's knowledge"" that can be assumed in a threat model.","In a threat model, ""Attacker's knowledge"" can vary significantly. One level assumes the attacker knows the system's design, architecture, and source code, implying a deep understanding of its internal workings. Another level assumes the attacker lacks detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error to discover vulnerabilities or gain information. These assumptions influence the types of attacks that are considered plausible and the defenses that need to be prioritized."
"What aspects are considered under ""Attacker's capability"" in a threat model?","Under ""Attacker's capability"" in a threat model, several aspects are considered to assess what an adversary can achieve. These include how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, which refers to their processing power, storage, and network bandwidth. It also considers what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, defining their access points and scope of influence. Finally, it evaluates whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly, which impacts the sophistication and duration of potential attacks."
How does the availability of computing resources impact an attacker's capability?,"The availability of computing resources significantly impacts an attacker's capability by determining the scale and complexity of attacks they can execute. More computing resources allow an attacker to perform brute-force attacks faster, process larger amounts of stolen data, or run more sophisticated simulations to discover vulnerabilities, thereby increasing their overall effectiveness and potential for damage."
Why is it important to consider what parts of the system an attacker can interact with?,"It is important to consider what parts of the system an attacker can interact with because this defines their potential attack surface and the scope of their influence. Understanding these interaction points helps in identifying critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing security measures for exposed components, and designing defenses that limit an attacker's ability to move laterally or escalate privileges within the system."
How does the attacker's time constraint influence their attack strategy?,"The attacker's time constraint significantly influences their attack strategy. If an attacker has unlimited time, they can employ more patient, sophisticated, and resource-intensive methods like extensive reconnaissance, long-term probing, or developing highly customized exploits. Conversely, if they need to act quickly, their strategy will likely involve faster, potentially less subtle, and more opportunistic attacks, relying on known vulnerabilities or readily available tools."
What are the general categories of factors that lead to insecurity in systems?,"The general categories of factors that lead to insecurity in systems are system complexity and human factors. System complexity introduces more potential vulnerabilities and requires a broader range of security measures. Human factors, involving system users, developers, and external parties, contribute to insecurity through misconfiguration, design flaws, implementation errors, and social engineering."
What is the overarching goal when providing a protected environment for data and its processing?,"The overarching goal when providing a protected environment for data and its processing is to ensure the security of the cyber system by implementing appropriate measures. This involves safeguarding against various threats, whether they arise from system complexity or human factors, to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and system operations."
"Describe the concept of ""misconfiguration"" in the context of system users and insecurity.","In the context of system users and insecurity, ""misconfiguration"" refers to the incorrect or improper setup of security features. This happens when security features are not used correctly by users, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities or leaving parts of the system exposed to potential threats, even if the features themselves are robust."
How does the desire for convenience among users impact system security?,"The desire for convenience among users can negatively impact system security because users may try to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient. This action, driven by a preference for ease of use, can weaken the system's defenses, making it more susceptible to attacks and compromising its overall security posture."
What are the two main areas where system developers can introduce insecurity?,"System developers can introduce insecurity in two main areas: incorrect design of security features and incorrect implementation of security components. Incorrect design means the foundational plans for security are flawed, while incorrect implementation means the actual coding or integration of security mechanisms contains errors, both of which can lead to vulnerabilities."
"What is ""social engineering"" and how is it exploited by external parties?","Social engineering is a psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. External parties exploit social engineering by manipulating an individual's trust for profit. This allows them to bypass technical security measures by tricking legitimate users into compromising the system, often by impersonating trusted entities or creating deceptive scenarios."
"What are the three main aspects covered under ""Basics of Cyber Security""?","The three main aspects covered under ""Basics of Cyber Security"" are the Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security. The Threat Model identifies potential adversaries and threats, Security Strategies outline approaches to defend against these threats, and Design Principles provide fundamental guidelines for building secure systems."
"In the context of a Threat Model, what does ""Security properties"" refer to?","In the context of a Threat Model, ""Security properties"" refer to the specific attributes or goals that the system aims to achieve to maintain its security. These properties typically include confidentiality (protecting information from unauthorized disclosure), integrity (ensuring information is accurate and complete), and availability (ensuring authorized users can access information and resources when needed)."
What is the primary purpose of describing adversaries and threats in a Threat Model?,"The primary purpose of describing adversaries and threats in a Threat Model is to systematically understand the potential dangers to a system. This involves identifying who the attackers might be, what their motivations are, what resources and capabilities they possess, and what actions they might perform, which in turn helps in designing effective security measures."
"How does the concept of ""Trust"" relate to the failure of security solutions?","The concept of ""Trust"" directly relates to the failure of security solutions because if what should be trusted is not clearly defined, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. Without clear trust boundaries and expectations for entity behavior, security mechanisms can be misapplied or bypassed, leading to vulnerabilities and system compromise."
What is the implication of components outside the TCB being malicious and misbehaving?,The implication of components outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) being malicious and misbehaving is that security solutions must be designed to prevent any damages from these untrusted elements. This means the TCB must be robust enough to isolate itself and the system's critical assets from the potentially hostile environment outside its boundaries.
"Why is it important for the TCB to be ""Verifiable""?","It is important for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to be ""Verifiable"" because this principle, also known as correctness, ensures that it is possible to confirm the TCB functions as intended. Verifiability allows for rigorous analysis and proof that the TCB is free from flaws and meets its security specifications, thereby providing confidence in its trustworthiness."
"What is the core idea behind the ""Unbypassable"" principle in TCB design?","The core idea behind the ""Unbypassable"" principle in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design is completeness: there must be no alternative path or method to breach system security that circumvents the TCB. This ensures that the TCB is the sole arbiter of security decisions for critical operations, preventing attackers from finding loopholes around its protections."
How does a smaller TCB make a system more trustworthy?,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) makes a system more trustworthy because it reduces the number of components that must be assumed to be secure. With fewer components in the trusted core, there are fewer assumptions that could potentially be violated, making the system's security easier to reason about and verify, thus increasing overall trustworthiness."
"What does it mean for an attacker to ""lack detailed knowledge"" and how do they compensate?","For an attacker to ""lack detailed knowledge"" means they do not possess comprehensive information about the system's design, architecture, or source code. To compensate for this, they must rely on probing or trial and error. Probing involves systematically testing the system's responses to various inputs, while trial and error involves repeatedly attempting different actions until a vulnerability or desired outcome is found."
"How do ""Security Strategies"" fit into the overall ""Basics of Cyber Security""?","""Security Strategies"" fit into the overall ""Basics of Cyber Security"" as the planned approaches and methods used to defend against the threats identified in the Threat Model. They outline how to implement the necessary protections and utilize the design principles to achieve the desired security properties for a system."
What is the primary difference in security needs between a standalone computer with a single user and a networked computer?,"The primary difference in security needs between a standalone computer with a single user (monoprogram) and a networked computer is the addition of process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection for the networked system. The standalone system only requires physical security, while the networked system, due to its increased complexity and connectivity, demands a broader range of measures to secure processes, data, user access, and network communications."
"Explain why ""Developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes"" is a factor in system insecurity.","""Developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes"" is a factor in system insecurity because it acknowledges the inherent fallibility of individuals involved in creating software. These mistakes can manifest as security flaws in design or implementation, such as logic errors, buffer overflows, or incorrect access controls, which can then be exploited by attackers, leading to vulnerabilities in the system."
"What is the role of ""valid justifications"" when assuming TCB components are secure?","The role of ""valid justifications"" when assuming Trusted Computing Base (TCB) components are secure is to provide a sound basis for that trust. These justifications could include rigorous testing, formal verification, code reviews, or adherence to secure development practices, ensuring that the assumption of security is not arbitrary but is supported by evidence and analysis."
"How does the diagram on the Threat Model page illustrate the relationship between Attackers' assumptions, Computer System, Security Properties, and TCB?","The diagram on the Threat Model page illustrates the relationship by showing ""Attackers' assumptions"" as an input or consideration for the ""Computer System."" The ""Computer System"" itself contains the ""TCB"" (Trusted Computing Base), indicating that the TCB is a core, trusted part of the system. The ""Computer System"" is then linked to ""Security Properties"" with bidirectional arrows, signifying that the system is designed to achieve these properties, and the properties influence the system's design and implementation, taking into account the attackers' assumptions and the trusted components within the TCB."
