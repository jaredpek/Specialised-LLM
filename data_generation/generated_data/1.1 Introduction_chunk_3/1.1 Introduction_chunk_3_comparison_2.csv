"Compare the security requirements of a standalone computer (single user, monoprogram) with a standalone computer (single user, multiprogram).","A standalone computer operating as a single user with a monoprogram primarily requires Physical security. Physical security refers to measures designed to protect the physical hardware and infrastructure of the system. In contrast, a standalone computer operating as a single user with a multiprogram requires both Physical security and Process protection. Process protection involves mechanisms to isolate and protect individual running programs from each other, which becomes necessary when multiple programs are active simultaneously on the same system."
"What are the differences in security requirements between a standalone computer (single user, multiprogram) and a standalone computer (multiple user)?","A standalone computer operating as a single user with a multiprogram requires Physical security and Process protection. Physical security protects the physical hardware, while Process protection isolates running programs. A standalone computer operating with multiple users, however, requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. Data protection involves safeguarding stored information from unauthorized access or corruption, and User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user to grant appropriate access to the system and its data."
Compare the security requirements for a standalone computer (multiple user) and a networked computer.,"A standalone computer with multiple users requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. Physical security protects the hardware, Process protection isolates programs, Data protection safeguards information, and User authentication verifies user identities. A networked computer requires all of these protections, plus Communication protection. Communication protection involves securing data as it is transmitted across a network, safeguarding it from interception, modification, or unauthorized access during communication."
"What are the differences in security requirements between a standalone computer (single user, monoprogram) and a standalone computer (multiple user)?","A standalone computer operating as a single user with a monoprogram requires Physical security, which protects the physical hardware. A standalone computer with multiple users, however, requires a more extensive set of protections: Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. Process protection isolates running programs, Data protection safeguards stored information, and User authentication verifies user identities to control access in a multi-user environment."
"Compare the security requirements of a standalone computer (single user, monoprogram) with a networked computer.","A standalone computer operating as a single user with a monoprogram requires only Physical security, which protects the physical hardware. A networked computer, being part of a larger network, has significantly more extensive security requirements. It needs Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection. Process protection isolates running programs, Data protection safeguards stored information, User authentication verifies user identities, and Communication protection secures data during network transmission."
"What are the differences in security requirements between a standalone computer (single user, multiprogram) and a networked computer?","A standalone computer operating as a single user with a multiprogram requires Physical security and Process protection. Physical security protects the physical hardware, and Process protection isolates running programs. A networked computer, on the other hand, requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection. Data protection safeguards stored information, User authentication verifies user identities, and Communication protection secures data during network transmission, all of which are additional requirements for a networked environment."
Compare Physical security with Process protection in the context of computer systems.,"Physical security refers to measures taken to protect the physical hardware and infrastructure of a computer system from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It is a foundational security layer present in all types of computer systems described. Process protection, in contrast, is a security measure required when a computer system runs multiple programs or supports multiple users. It focuses on isolating and protecting individual running programs (processes) from each other, preventing one process from interfering with or compromising another."
What are the differences between Process protection and Data protection in computer security?,"Process protection is a security measure designed to isolate and protect individual running programs (processes) from interfering with each other, typically required in multiprogram or multi-user environments. Data protection, on the other hand, focuses on safeguarding stored information from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or destruction. While process protection ensures the integrity of execution, data protection ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data itself, especially crucial in multi-user systems."
Compare Data protection with User authentication in computer security.,"Data protection involves safeguarding stored information from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a system or its resources. While data protection secures the data itself, user authentication acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only legitimate and identified users can gain access to the system and, consequently, to the protected data."
What are the differences between User authentication and Communication protection?,"User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user to grant them appropriate access to a system or its resources. It ensures that only authorized individuals can log in and interact with the system. Communication protection, in contrast, is specifically concerned with securing data as it is transmitted between systems or components, particularly over a network. It safeguards information from interception, tampering, or unauthorized disclosure during its transit, rather than at the point of user access."
Compare the causes of insecurity stemming from System Users with those from System Developers.,"Insecurity stemming from System Users arises from their incorrect use of security features, such as misconfiguration, or their tendency to disable security configurations for convenience. In contrast, insecurity stemming from System Developers occurs when security features are not designed or implemented correctly, or simply due to human mistakes made by developers during the creation of the system or its security components."
What are the differences in how System Users and External Parties contribute to insecurity?,"System Users contribute to insecurity through internal actions such as misconfiguration of security features or disabling security settings for convenience. External Parties, on the other hand, contribute to insecurity through external manipulation, specifically by exploiting an individual's trust for profit, a practice commonly known as social engineering. Social engineering involves psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information."
Compare the causes of insecurity originating from System Developers with those from External Parties.,"Insecurity originating from System Developers is due to internal factors such as security features not being designed or implemented correctly, or general human mistakes made by developers. Insecurity originating from External Parties is due to external factors, specifically the manipulation of an individual's trust for profit, often through social engineering. Social engineering is a tactic used by attackers to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security."
What are the differences between misconfiguration by users and disabling security by users as causes of insecurity?,"Misconfiguration by users refers to the incorrect setup or adjustment of security features, leading to vulnerabilities. This implies an error in understanding or applying security settings. Disabling security by users, however, refers to the intentional act of turning off or bypassing security configurations, often driven by a desire for convenience, even if those configurations are not inherently inconvenient. Both lead to insecurity but differ in intent and nature of the action."
Compare incorrect design by developers with human mistakes by developers as sources of insecurity.,"Incorrect design by developers refers to fundamental flaws in the conceptualization or architecture of security features, meaning the security components themselves are not correctly planned. Incorrect implementation falls under this as well, where the design is not translated into code properly. Human mistakes by developers, while potentially encompassing design and implementation errors, broadly refers to any errors made by developers during the development process, acknowledging that humans are fallible and can introduce vulnerabilities inadvertently."
Compare the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) with untrusted entities in the context of a threat model.,"In a threat model, the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to a set of components (e.g., software, OS, firmware, hardware) that are explicitly trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. These components are assumed to be secure with valid justifications. Untrusted entities, in contrast, are components or actors outside the TCB whose resources, capabilities, knowledge, and potential actions are analyzed as threats. The threat model considers what these untrusted entities have, can do, know, and what security properties the system aims to achieve against them."
What are the differences between attacker's assumptions and security properties within a threat model?,"Within a threat model, attacker's assumptions describe the characteristics and capabilities attributed to potential adversaries, such as their knowledge of the system, the resources they can leverage, and their time constraints. Security properties, on the other hand, define the specific security goals that the system aims to achieve, such as confidentiality, integrity, or availability. The threat model uses attacker's assumptions to understand potential attacks and then defines security properties as the desired outcomes to counter those attacks."
Compare the resources of untrusted entities with the capabilities of untrusted entities as described in a threat model.,"In a threat model, the resources of untrusted entities refer to what these entities possess, such as computing power, tools, or access to certain information. The capabilities of untrusted entities, in contrast, refer to what these entities are able to do or the actions they can perform within or against the system. While resources are the assets an entity has, capabilities are the actions it can execute using those assets."
What are the differences between the capabilities of untrusted entities and the knowledge of untrusted entities in a threat model?,"In a threat model, the capabilities of untrusted entities refer to the actions they can perform and the parts of the system they can interact with, as well as their time constraints (e.g., unlimited time or need to act quickly). The knowledge of untrusted entities, in contrast, refers to what they know about the system, such as its design, architecture, or source code, or conversely, their lack of detailed knowledge which forces them to rely on probing or trial and error."
"Compare what an entity is expected to do with what an entity is expected not to do, regarding trust.","Regarding trust, ""what the entity is expected to do"" refers to the positive behaviors or functions an entity is relied upon to perform, such as anti-malware detecting malicious programs or a system preventing illegal account logins. ""What the entity is expected not to do,"" in contrast, refers to the negative behaviors or actions an entity is relied upon to refrain from, such as a website not exposing private data to third parties or an application not injecting viruses into a system. Both aspects are crucial for establishing the degree to which an entity is trusted to behave."
What are the differences between anti-malware detecting malicious programs and a system preventing illegal account login as examples of expected behavior?,"Anti-malware detecting malicious programs is an example of an entity (the anti-malware software) being trusted to actively identify and counter threats, specifically malicious software. A system preventing illegal account login is another example of an entity (the system itself) being trusted to enforce access control and protect against unauthorized entry. Both are examples of an entity being trusted to perform specific security functions, but they address different types of threats: malware infection versus unauthorized access."
Compare a website not exposing private data with an application not injecting a virus as examples of expected non-behavior.,"A website not exposing private data to third parties is an example of an entity (the website) being trusted to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of user information by refraining from a specific harmful action. An application not injecting a virus into a system is another example of an entity (the application) being trusted to maintain system integrity and security by refraining from introducing malicious code. Both illustrate ""what the entity is expected not to do"" to maintain trust."
What are the differences between components inside the TCB and components outside the TCB?,"Components inside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are a set of elements (e.g., software, OS, firmware, hardware) that are explicitly trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. When designing a security solution, these components are assumed to be secure with valid justifications. Components outside the TCB, conversely, are not trusted and are considered potentially malicious or capable of misbehaving. Security solutions must be designed to prevent any damages that could arise from these external components."
Compare the design principle of assuming TCB components are secure with preventing damages from components outside the TCB.,"When designing a security solution, assuming all components inside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are secure with valid justifications is a fundamental principle. This means the core trusted elements are considered reliable. In contrast, preventing any damages from any components outside of the TCB is another critical design principle. This acknowledges that external components are not trusted and can be malicious or misbehave, thus requiring protective measures to contain their potential harm."
What are the differences between the TCB design principles of Unbypassable (completeness) and Tamper-resistant (security)?,"The Unbypassable (completeness) principle for TCB design states that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This ensures that the TCB is the sole arbiter of security. The Tamper-resistant (security) principle, on the other hand, dictates that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB, meaning these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state. While unbypassable focuses on preventing circumvention, tamper-resistant focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of the TCB itself."
Compare the TCB design principles of Unbypassable (completeness) and Verifiable (correctness).,"The Unbypassable (completeness) principle for TCB design mandates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB, ensuring that the TCB's security controls are comprehensive and cannot be circumvented. The Verifiable (correctness) principle, in contrast, states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This means the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous checking to confirm it behaves as intended and is free from flaws."
What are the differences between the TCB design principles of Tamper-resistant (security) and Verifiable (correctness)?,"The Tamper-resistant (security) principle for TCB design requires that the TCB be protected against other parts outside the TCB, preventing external components from modifying its code or state. This focuses on the TCB's integrity and resilience against external attacks. The Verifiable (correctness) principle, conversely, states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This focuses on the ability to prove that the TCB functions as intended and is free from errors, ensuring its reliability through inspection and analysis."
Compare the characteristics and implications of a smaller TCB versus a larger TCB.,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions, aligning with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. This reduced complexity makes it simpler to ensure its correctness. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging because it necessitates considering a greater number of entities as potentially malicious, which would otherwise be included in a larger, trusted base. A larger TCB, conversely, would be less trustworthy and harder to verify due to more assumptions, but potentially less challenging to design as fewer entities might be considered malicious."
What are the differences between the trustworthiness and ease of verification of a smaller TCB?,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is more trustworthy because it inherently relies on fewer assumptions about its components, making it less likely for those assumptions to be violated. Concurrently, a smaller TCB is easier to verify because its reduced complexity means there are fewer components and interactions to inspect and confirm for correctness. Both characteristics contribute to the overall security and reliability benefits of a smaller TCB."
Compare the ease of verification of a smaller TCB with the challenge of designing with a smaller TCB.,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is easier to verify because its reduced complexity and fewer assumptions simplify the process of confirming its correctness. This aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. However, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging because it requires the system designer to consider a greater number of entities as potentially malicious, as they are not included within the trusted boundary, thus increasing the scope of potential threats to mitigate."
What are the differences between an active attacker and a passive attacker?,"An active attacker is a type of adversary whose actions involve manipulating or disrupting systems. Examples of active attacks include modifying data or injecting code into a system. In contrast, a passive attacker is a type of adversary whose actions are limited to observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation. Passive attacks focus on reconnaissance and data collection without altering the system's state."
Compare an attacker with detailed knowledge with an attacker lacking detailed knowledge.,"An attacker with detailed knowledge is an adversary who possesses comprehensive understanding of the system's design, architecture, source code, and other intricate details. This knowledge allows for more targeted and sophisticated attacks. An attacker lacking detailed knowledge, conversely, does not have this in-depth understanding and must rely on less efficient methods such as probing, trial and error, or exploiting general vulnerabilities to gain information or access."
What are the differences between an attacker's knowledge and an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's knowledge refers to what the adversary knows about the system, such as its design, architecture, or source code, or the extent to which they lack such detailed knowledge and must rely on probing. An attacker's capability, on the other hand, refers to what the adversary can do. This includes the computing resources they can leverage, the specific parts of the system they can interact with, and their time constraints, such as having unlimited time or needing to act quickly."
Compare an attacker's computing resources with an attacker's interaction with system parts.,"An attacker's computing resources refer to the amount of processing power, storage, network bandwidth, or other computational assets that an adversary can leverage to conduct an attack. This relates to the scale and intensity of potential attacks. An attacker's interaction with system parts, in contrast, refers to which specific components, interfaces, or functionalities of the system the attacker is able to engage with, indicating the scope and entry points of potential attacks."
What are the differences between an attacker with unlimited time and an attacker needing to act quickly?,"An attacker with unlimited time is an adversary who does not face time constraints, allowing them to conduct prolonged reconnaissance, execute complex multi-stage attacks, or patiently wait for vulnerabilities to emerge. An attacker needing to act quickly, conversely, operates under time pressure, which may be due to detection risks, operational windows, or other factors. This constraint can limit the complexity, duration, and thoroughness of their attack attempts."
Compare the necessity of Physical Security versus Process Protection in a standalone computer.,"Physical Security is a fundamental requirement for any standalone computer, regardless of its operational mode, as it protects the physical hardware from unauthorized access or damage. Process Protection, however, becomes necessary only when a standalone computer is designed to run multiple programs (multiprogram) or support multiple users. Its purpose is to isolate and protect individual processes from interfering with each other, which is not a concern in a single-user, monoprogram environment."
What are the differences in necessity between Process Protection and Data Protection in a standalone computer?,"Process Protection is necessary in a standalone computer when multiple programs are running (multiprogram) or when there are multiple users, to ensure that individual processes are isolated and do not interfere with each other. Data Protection, on the other hand, becomes necessary specifically in standalone computers that support multiple users. Its primary role is to safeguard the stored information from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure, which is a heightened concern when multiple users share access to data."
Compare the necessity of Data Protection versus User Authentication in a standalone computer.,"Both Data Protection and User Authentication become necessary in a standalone computer when it supports multiple users. Data Protection focuses on safeguarding the actual stored information from unauthorized access, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. User Authentication, conversely, is the mechanism for verifying the identity of each user. It acts as a prerequisite for Data Protection, ensuring that only authenticated users can attempt to access the protected data, thereby controlling who can interact with the system's information."
What are the differences in necessity between User Authentication and Communication Protection in a computer system?,"User Authentication is necessary for computer systems that support multiple users, whether standalone or networked, to verify user identities and control access to resources. Communication Protection, however, is a security measure that becomes necessary specifically for networked computers. Its purpose is to secure data as it is transmitted across a network, protecting it from interception, tampering, or unauthorized access during communication, a threat not present in isolated standalone systems."
Compare the security requirements of a Standalone single user monoprogram computer with a Standalone multiple user computer.,"A Standalone single user monoprogram computer has minimal security requirements, needing only Physical security to protect its hardware. In contrast, a Standalone multiple user computer has significantly more complex security needs. It requires Physical security, Process protection to isolate different programs or user sessions, Data protection to safeguard shared or private user data, and User authentication to verify the identity of each user accessing the system."
What are the differences in security requirements between a Standalone single user multiprogram computer and a Networked computer?,"A Standalone single user multiprogram computer requires Physical security to protect its hardware and Process protection to isolate running programs. A Networked computer, however, has a broader set of requirements due to its connectivity. It needs Physical security, Process protection, Data protection to secure information, User authentication to verify user identities, and crucially, Communication protection to secure data transmitted over the network, which is unique to networked environments."
Compare the role of Physical Security versus Communication Protection in overall system security.,"Physical Security plays a foundational role in overall system security by protecting the physical hardware and infrastructure from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It is a prerequisite for all other security layers. Communication Protection, in contrast, plays a specialized role, specifically addressing the security of data in transit over a network. It safeguards information during transmission, protecting against threats like eavesdropping or tampering that are inherent to networked environments, but not relevant to isolated physical systems."
What are the security implications of a single user versus multiple users on a standalone computer?,"For a standalone computer, the presence of a single user implies simpler security requirements, primarily focusing on physical protection and potentially process isolation if multiple programs are run. The introduction of multiple users, however, significantly increases security implications. It necessitates additional protections such as Data protection to safeguard individual user data and shared resources, and User authentication to verify identities and control access, ensuring users can only access authorized information and functionalities."
Compare the security implications of a monoprogram versus a multiprogram environment on a standalone computer.,"On a standalone computer, a monoprogram environment, where only one program runs at a time, has simpler security implications, primarily requiring Physical security. There is no inherent need to isolate programs from each other. A multiprogram environment, conversely, where multiple programs run concurrently, introduces the additional security implication of needing Process protection. This is crucial to ensure that one running program cannot interfere with, compromise, or access the resources of another, maintaining system stability and integrity."
What are the security implications of a standalone computer versus a networked computer?,"A standalone computer's security implications are primarily internal, focusing on protecting the physical hardware, isolating processes (if multiprogram), safeguarding data (if multi-user), and authenticating users (if multi-user). Its threats are largely confined to its immediate environment. A networked computer, however, faces all these internal implications plus significant external ones due to its connectivity. It requires Communication protection to secure data transmitted across networks, making it vulnerable to a broader range of threats like network eavesdropping, denial-of-service attacks, and remote exploitation."
Compare the impact of user convenience on security versus the impact of developer mistakes on security.,"The impact of user convenience on security arises when System Users prioritize ease of use over security, leading them to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient, or to misconfigure features. This introduces vulnerabilities through intentional or unintentional user actions. The impact of developer mistakes on security, conversely, stems from System Developers' errors in designing or implementing security features, or general human fallibility during development. These mistakes can create inherent flaws or backdoors in the system's security mechanisms, regardless of user behavior."
"What are the differences between the purpose of identifying ""what is trusted"" versus ""what is not trusted"" in a threat model?","In a threat model, the purpose of identifying ""what is trusted"" (the Trusted Computing Base or TCB) is to define the core components of the system that are assumed to be secure and reliable, forming the foundation of security. The purpose of identifying ""what is not trusted"" is to delineate the entities, components, or actors outside this trusted boundary that are considered potential adversaries. This identification allows for the analysis of their resources, capabilities, knowledge, and potential actions to understand and mitigate threats effectively."
"Compare the role of ""expected to do"" behaviors versus ""expected not to do"" behaviors in establishing trust.","In establishing trust, ""expected to do"" behaviors define the positive actions an entity is relied upon to perform, such as an anti-malware program detecting malicious software or a system preventing illegal account logins. These are active security functions. ""Expected not to do"" behaviors, conversely, define the negative actions an entity is relied upon to refrain from, such as a website not exposing private data or an application not injecting a virus. Both categories are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of an entity's trustworthiness, as trust is built on both reliable performance and reliable abstinence from harmful actions."
What are the differences between the design assumption for components inside the TCB and the design approach for components outside the TCB?,"For components inside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the design assumption is that they are secure, provided there are valid justifications for this trust. This means the security solution is built upon the premise that these core components are reliable. For components outside the TCB, the design approach is to prevent any damages from them, as they are not trusted and can be malicious or misbehave. This requires implementing robust isolation, validation, and protection mechanisms to contain potential threats originating from untrusted external elements."
"Compare the TCB design principle of Unbypassable (completeness) with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle in TCB design.","The Unbypassable (completeness) principle in TCB design states that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB, ensuring that all security-critical operations are mediated by the trusted core. This focuses on the integrity of the security perimeter. The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, while a general design philosophy, is applied to TCB design by advocating for a smaller TCB. A smaller TCB is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it reduces complexity and the number of assumptions that could be violated, thereby simplifying the task of ensuring its correctness and security."
