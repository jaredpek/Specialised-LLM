Analyze the relationship between system complexity and insecurity based on the provided information.,"System complexity directly leads to insecurity. As systems become more complex, the number of security requirements and potential vulnerabilities increases. For instance, a standalone computer with a single user and monoprogram requires only physical security, which involves protecting physical access to the system. However, introducing multiprogram capabilities adds the need for process protection, mechanisms to isolate and protect individual processes. Further complexity, such as supporting multiple users, necessitates data protection, safeguards for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and user authentication, the process of verifying user identity. The highest level of complexity, a networked computer, additionally requires communication protection, measures to secure data transmitted over a network, demonstrating how each layer of complexity introduces new security challenges and potential points of failure."
What are the security requirements for a standalone computer with a single user and a monoprogram environment?,"For a standalone computer operating with a single user and a monoprogram, the primary security requirement is physical security, which refers to measures designed to prevent unauthorized physical access to the computer system and its components."
Describe the security requirements for a standalone computer supporting a single user with multiprogram capabilities.,"A standalone computer with a single user and multiprogram capabilities requires both physical security, which protects physical access to the hardware, and process protection, mechanisms that isolate and protect individual running programs (processes) from unauthorized access or modification by other processes or the operating system."
Outline the security requirements for a standalone computer designed for multiple users.,"A standalone computer supporting multiple users necessitates physical security, protecting physical access to the hardware; process protection, isolating running programs; data protection, safeguards implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data; and user authentication, the process of verifying the identity of a user before granting access to a system."
List the comprehensive security requirements for a networked computer system.,"A networked computer system demands a comprehensive set of security requirements: physical security, protecting physical access to the hardware; process protection, isolating running programs; data protection, securing stored information; user authentication, verifying user identities; and communication protection, security measures applied to data during transmission over a network, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity."
Explain how system users can contribute to insecurity within a system.,"System users can contribute to insecurity in two primary ways. Firstly, they may not use security features correctly, leading to misconfiguration, which is an incorrect or suboptimal setup of a system, application, or security feature. Secondly, users often prioritize convenience and might attempt to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses."
Discuss the ways system developers can introduce insecurity into a system.,"System developers can introduce insecurity through incorrect design or implementation of security features, specific functionalities or mechanisms within a system designed to protect its assets, and security components, specific parts of a system designed to enforce security policies. Additionally, as humans, developers are prone to making mistakes during the development process, which can lead to vulnerabilities in the system."
Describe the role of external parties in leading to system insecurity.,"External parties contribute to insecurity primarily by manipulating an individual's trust for profit. A common example of this is social engineering, the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, often used by attackers to bypass security measures."
Summarize the human factors that lead to insecurity.,"Human factors leading to insecurity stem from three main groups: System Users, individuals who interact with a system; System Developers, those responsible for designing and building systems; and External Parties, individuals or groups outside the system who may interact with its users. System Users cause insecurity through incorrect use or misconfiguration, an incorrect setup of security features, and by disabling security for convenience. System Developers contribute through incorrect design or implementation of security features and general human error. External Parties exploit human trust, often through social engineering, the psychological manipulation of people, to gain unauthorized access or information."
What are the key components that constitute a Threat Model in cyber security?,"A Threat Model, a structured approach to identify, categorize, and prioritize potential threats, in cyber security is comprised of three key components: the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security; Attacker's assumption, the presumed characteristics of adversaries; and Security properties, the specific attributes a system aims to achieve for security. These elements collectively describe the adversaries, their potential threats, and the system's defenses."
Describe the primary purpose of a Threat Model in the context of cyber security.,"The primary purpose of a Threat Model, a structured approach to identify, categorize, and prioritize potential threats, is to describe the adversaries and threats that need to be considered for a given system. It helps in understanding what entities are trusted and not trusted, referring to the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), what resources and capabilities untrusted entities possess, and what security properties, specific attributes a system aims to achieve, the system aims to achieve."
What specific aspects of adversaries and threats are described within a Threat Model?,"A Threat Model, a structured approach to identify, categorize, and prioritize potential threats, describes several specific aspects of adversaries and threats. It clarifies what is trusted and what is not trusted, referring to the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security. For untrusted entities, it details their resources, capabilities, and knowledge, as well as the actions they can perform. Finally, it outlines the security properties, specific attributes a system aims to achieve, the system aims to achieve."
Provide a clear definition of 'Trust' in the context of cyber security.,"In cyber security, 'Trust' is defined as the degree to which an entity, any component, process, user, or system, is expected to behave in a certain manner. This expectation encompasses both what the entity is anticipated to do, such as an anti-malware detecting malicious programs or a system preventing illegal account logins, and what the entity is expected not to do, like a website not exposing private data to third parties or an application not injecting viruses into a system."
Explain why establishing trust is crucial for cyber system security.,"Establishing trust is crucial for cyber system security because security cannot be achieved if no entities, any component, process, user, or system, are trusted. It is vital to clearly define what should be trusted; otherwise, designed security solutions may fail in practice. Without a foundation of trust, the assumptions underlying security mechanisms become invalid, leading to potential vulnerabilities and breaches."
Give examples of what an entity is expected to do when trust is established.,"When trust is established, an entity, any component, process, user, or system, is expected to perform certain actions. Examples include anti-malware software, designed to detect malicious programs, detecting malicious programs, software designed to cause harm, and a system preventing illegal account logins. These are positive behaviors that contribute to the overall security posture."
Provide examples of what an entity is expected *not* to do when trust is established.,"When trust is established, an entity, any component, process, user, or system, is expected to refrain from certain actions. Examples include a website not exposing private data, confidential information, to third parties, and an application not injecting viruses, a type of malicious software, into a system. These are negative behaviors that, if they occur, would violate the established trust and compromise security."
Define the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and its significance.,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, such as software, OS (Operating System), firmware, and hardware, that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. Its significance lies in the fact that components outside the TCB can be malicious and misbehave, making the TCB the core set of elements that must be secure for the entire system to be considered secure."
What are the implications of components existing outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The implication of components existing outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, is that they can be malicious and misbehave. This means that any part of the system not included within the TCB cannot be inherently trusted and must be treated as a potential source of threats or vulnerabilities that could compromise the overall system security."
"When designing a security solution, what two key principles must be followed regarding the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?","When designing a security solution, two key principles must be followed regarding the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security. Firstly, all components inside the TCB must be assumed to be secure, with valid justifications, well-founded and evidence-backed reasons, for this assumption. Secondly, the design must prevent any damages from components that are outside of the TCB, acknowledging their potential for malicious behavior."
Explain the 'Unbypassable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Unbypassable' principle, also known as completeness, in TCB design dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security. This means that all security-critical operations and data paths must be routed through the TCB, ensuring that its security mechanisms are always in effect and cannot be circumvented."
Describe the 'Tamper-resistant' principle for TCB design.,"The 'Tamper-resistant' principle, also referred to as security, in TCB design states that the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code, the set of instructions that make up a program, or state, the current condition or configuration of a system. This ensures the integrity and reliability of the TCB's security functions."
What does the 'Verifiable' principle mean in the context of TCB design?,"The 'Verifiable' principle, also known as correctness, in TCB design means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis and testing to confirm that it behaves as expected and correctly enforces the system's security policies."
Discuss the advantages of designing a system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"Designing a system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, offers several advantages. A smaller TCB is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions. This approach aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, a design philosophy that advocates for simplicity, promoting simplicity and reducing the attack surface."
What challenges arise when designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, presents a significant challenge: it requires considering more malicious entities, components or actors designed to cause harm. As the TCB shrinks, more components fall outside of it, meaning a larger portion of the system must be treated as potentially untrusted. This increases the complexity of ensuring that these external, potentially malicious entities cannot compromise the smaller, trusted core."
Categorize and describe the different types of attackers based on their actions.,"Attackers can be categorized into two main types based on their actions: Active and Passive. An Active attacker, an adversary who attempts to alter system resources, aims to manipulate or disrupt systems, which includes actions like modifying data or injecting code. A Passive attacker, an adversary who attempts to learn information without affecting system resources, on the other hand, focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operations."
What aspects define an attacker's knowledge in the context of security assumptions?,"An attacker's knowledge can be defined by two main aspects. Firstly, they might possess detailed knowledge of the system's design, architecture, or source code. Secondly, they might lack such detailed knowledge and, in that case, must rely on probing, actively testing a system, or trial and error, a problem-solving method of trying different approaches, to understand and exploit the system."
Identify the key aspects that define an attacker's capability.,"An attacker's capability is defined by several key aspects. These include how much computing resources, hardware and software components, the attacker can leverage, what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, and whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly, referring to time constraints. These factors determine the scope and sophistication of potential attacks."
Provide an overview of the fundamental concepts covered in the basics of cyber security.,"The basics of cyber security encompass several fundamental concepts, including the Threat Model, a structured approach to identify threats; Security Strategies, high-level plans for security; and Design Principles of Computer Security, fundamental guidelines for secure systems. The Threat Model specifically delves into the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), Attacker's assumption, and Security properties, providing a framework for understanding potential risks and defenses."
Analyze the role of physical security across different computer system complexities.,"Physical security, measures designed to prevent unauthorized physical access, plays a foundational role across all levels of computer system complexity. For a standalone computer with a single user and monoprogram, it is the sole listed security requirement. As complexity increases to standalone single user multiprogram, standalone multiple user, and networked computers, physical security remains a constant and essential requirement, always serving as the baseline protection for the hardware and infrastructure, even as other layers of security are added."
Trace the evolution of security requirements as a computer system's complexity increases from a simple standalone to a networked environment.,"As a computer system's complexity increases, its security requirements evolve significantly. A standalone single user monoprogram system only requires physical security, protecting physical access. Adding multiprogram capabilities introduces the need for process protection, isolating running programs. Further complexity with multiple users then demands data protection, safeguarding data, and user authentication, verifying user identity. Finally, a networked computer, the most complex, requires all previous protections plus communication protection, securing data transmission, illustrating a progressive layering of security measures to address new vulnerabilities introduced by increased functionality and connectivity."
Discuss how user preference for convenience can impact system security.,"User preference for convenience can negatively impact system security because users may try to disable security configurations, specific settings enforcing security policies, that they find inconvenient. This action bypasses or weakens established security measures, creating vulnerabilities, weaknesses that can be exploited, that could be exploited. For example, disabling complex password requirements or multi-factor authentication for ease of access can significantly reduce the overall security posture of a system."
Explain the connection between developer mistakes and security vulnerabilities.,"Developer mistakes are directly connected to security vulnerabilities, weaknesses that can be exploited, because developers are humans and can make errors. These errors can manifest as security features, specific functionalities designed for protection, not being designed correctly or security components, parts of a system enforcing security policies, not being implemented correctly. Such flaws in design or implementation can introduce weaknesses into the system that malicious actors can exploit, leading to security breaches."
Elaborate on social engineering as a threat from external parties.,"Social engineering, the psychological manipulation of people, is a significant threat from external parties, individuals or groups outside the system, because it involves the manipulation of an individual's trust for profit. Instead of technical exploits, attackers use psychological tactics to deceive people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. This method leverages human vulnerabilities rather than system flaws, making it a potent tool for external parties to bypass even robust technical defenses."
What is the role of 'Attacker's assumption' within a Threat Model?,"The 'Attacker's assumption' within a Threat Model, a structured approach to identify threats, defines the presumed characteristics, knowledge, capabilities, and motivations of potential adversaries, individuals or groups with malicious intent. This component is crucial for understanding who might attack the system, what resources they have, what they know about the system, and what actions they are capable of performing. By making these assumptions explicit, security designers can better anticipate threats and develop appropriate countermeasures, actions to reduce a threat."
Explain the significance of 'Security properties' in a Threat Model.,"In a Threat Model, a structured approach to identify threats, 'Security properties' represent the specific attributes or characteristics that the system aims to achieve to ensure its security. These properties define the desired secure state of the system, such as confidentiality (preventing unauthorized disclosure), integrity (preventing unauthorized alteration), or availability (ensuring accessibility). By clearly stating these properties, the Threat Model establishes the goals against which potential threats and vulnerabilities are evaluated, guiding the design of effective security mechanisms."
Analyze the relationship between the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and untrusted entities in a system.,"The relationship between the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, and untrusted entities, components or actors outside the TCB not assumed to be secure, is fundamental to system security. The TCB comprises components that are explicitly trusted, while components outside the TCB are considered untrusted and can be malicious or misbehave. When designing a security solution, it's crucial to assume TCB components are secure with valid justifications, and simultaneously prevent any damages from the untrusted components outside the TCB. This clear delineation allows for focused protection of the trusted core while mitigating risks from the untrusted periphery."
Why is it important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities, any component, process, user, or system, are trusted. Without a precise definition of trust, the assumptions underlying security solutions, implementations of security policies, become ambiguous, leading to potential failures in practice. Clearly defining trusted entities allows for the proper design and implementation of security mechanisms, ensuring that the system behaves as expected and is protected against malicious actions."
How does the KISS principle apply to the size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, a design philosophy advocating for simplicity, applies directly to the size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, by advocating for a smaller TCB. A system with a smaller TCB is considered more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions. This simplicity reduces the complexity of the trusted core, making it less prone to errors and easier to secure, aligning with the KISS principle's emphasis on avoiding unnecessary complexity."
Provide specific examples of actions an active attacker might perform.,"An active attacker, an adversary who attempts to alter system resources, aims to manipulate or disrupt systems. Specific examples of actions they might perform include modifying data, which involves altering information within the system, and injecting code, which means introducing malicious programming instructions to execute unauthorized commands or change system behavior."
What are the typical actions of a passive attacker?,"A passive attacker's, an adversary who attempts to learn information without affecting system resources, typical actions involve observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. This means they do not modify data or disrupt operations. Their goal is to collect intelligence, such as monitoring network traffic or analyzing system logs, to gain knowledge about the system or its users without being detected."
Contrast the two scenarios regarding an attacker's knowledge of a system.,"An attacker's knowledge of a system can fall into two contrasting scenarios. In one scenario, the attacker possesses detailed knowledge, such as the system's design, architecture, or source code. This allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks. In the other scenario, the attacker lacks such detailed knowledge and must instead rely on less efficient methods like probing, actively testing a system, or trial and error, a problem-solving method of trying different approaches, to discover vulnerabilities and gain information."
How do an attacker's computing resources influence their capabilities?,"An attacker's computing resources, hardware and software components available to an attacker, significantly influence their capabilities by determining the scale and complexity of attacks they can execute. Greater computing resources, such as powerful processors or large botnets, enable an attacker to perform resource-intensive tasks like brute-force attacks, trying every possible combination, complex cryptographic cracking, or large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks more effectively and quickly."
Why is it important to understand 'what parts of the system can the attacker interact with'?,"Understanding 'what parts of the system can the attacker interact with', meaning their ability to send inputs to or receive outputs from specific parts, is crucial because it defines the attack surface, the sum of points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data, and potential entry points. This knowledge helps in identifying which components are exposed to external interaction and thus require stronger security controls. If an attacker can interact with a critical component, it poses a higher risk than interaction with a non-critical, isolated part of the system."
Analyze how time constraints affect an attacker's capability.,"Time constraints, limitations on the duration an attacker has, significantly affect an attacker's capability by influencing the types of attacks they can attempt and their likelihood of success. If an attacker has unlimited time, they can employ slower, more methodical techniques like extensive probing, social engineering campaigns, or brute-force attacks over long periods. Conversely, if they need to act quickly, they might be forced to use readily available exploits, less sophisticated methods, or target easily accessible vulnerabilities, potentially limiting the scope and depth of their attack."
What is the overarching goal stated for securing data and its processing?,"The overarching goal stated for securing data, information stored or transmitted, and its processing, operations performed on data, is to provide a protected environment, a secure setting where data and its processing are safeguarded. This implies establishing a comprehensive set of safeguards and controls against various threats and unauthorized access, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
Explain misconfiguration as a specific way system users lead to insecurity.,"Misconfiguration, an incorrect or suboptimal setup of a system, is a specific way system users lead to insecurity because it involves security features, specific functionalities designed for protection, not being used correctly. Users might inadvertently set up system or application settings in a way that weakens defenses, opens unnecessary ports, or grants excessive permissions. These incorrect configurations create exploitable vulnerabilities, weaknesses that can be exploited, even if the underlying security features themselves are robust, simply due to improper application by the user."
Why are 'valid justifications' important when assuming components inside the TCB are secure?,"Valid justifications, well-founded and evidence-backed reasons, are important when assuming components inside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, are secure because this assumption forms the bedrock of the entire system's security. Without rigorous and justifiable reasons for trusting these components, the entire security model becomes fragile. Justifications ensure that the trust placed in the TCB is not arbitrary but based on evidence, such as formal verification, extensive testing, or secure development practices, thereby strengthening the overall security posture."
Summarize the three core design principles for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The three core design principles for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), a set of trusted components ensuring system security, are Unbypassable (completeness), Tamper-resistant (security), and Verifiable (correctness). Unbypassable ensures no security breach can occur by circumventing the TCB. Tamper-resistant dictates that the TCB must be protected from modification by external parts. Verifiable means that the correctness of the TCB can be proven or checked."
Analyze how increasing system complexity directly impacts the number and type of security requirements.,"Increasing system complexity directly impacts the number and type of security requirements by introducing new vulnerabilities, weaknesses that can be exploited, and attack vectors, paths used by attackers, that necessitate additional protective measures. For example, moving from a single-user monoprogram system (requiring only physical security, protecting physical access) to a multi-user system adds process protection (isolating programs), data protection (safeguarding data), and user authentication (verifying user identity). Further, a networked system introduces the need for communication protection (securing data transmission). Each layer of complexity expands the potential for insecurity, thus demanding a broader and deeper set of security controls to maintain a protected environment."
What is the core message conveyed by the statement 'System Complexity Leads to Insecurity'?,"The core message conveyed by 'System Complexity Leads to Insecurity' is that as computer systems become more intricate, with added functionalities, users, and connectivity, the inherent difficulty in securing them increases proportionally. Each layer of complexity introduces new potential points of failure, new interactions that can be exploited, and a greater number of security requirements that must be meticulously addressed. This makes the system more challenging to protect comprehensively, thereby increasing its susceptibility to various forms of attack and compromise."
