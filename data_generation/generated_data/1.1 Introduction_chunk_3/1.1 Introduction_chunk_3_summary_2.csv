Provide a comprehensive summary of how system complexity influences security requirements.,"As system complexity increases, the security requirements for providing a protected environment for data and their processing also expand. For a ""standalone computer single user monoprogram,"" only ""Physical security"" is required. When the system becomes a ""standalone computer single user multiprogram,"" ""Process protection"" is added to physical security. Further complexity, such as a ""standalone computer multiple user"" system, introduces the need for ""Data protection"" and ""User authentication"" in addition to physical and process protection. The highest level of complexity shown, a ""networked computer,"" requires all previous protections plus ""Communication protection.""
*   **Physical security:** Measures to protect physical access to computer systems and data.
*   **Process protection:** Mechanisms to isolate and protect running programs (processes) from each other and from unauthorized access.
*   **Data protection:** Safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Summarise the challenges associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB.,"While a smaller ""Trusted Computing Base (TCB)"" is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify, ""designing a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging.""

Summarise the relationship between the TCB and components outside of it in a security solution.,"In a security solution, the ""Trusted Computing Base (TCB)"" is the core set of components assumed to be secure, while components outside the TCB are considered potentially malicious and capable of misbehaving. Therefore, the relationship dictates that the security solution must ""assume all the components inside the TCB are secure with valid justifications"" and, critically, ""prevent any damages from any components outside of the TCB."" This establishes a clear boundary and a defensive posture against untrusted elements.
