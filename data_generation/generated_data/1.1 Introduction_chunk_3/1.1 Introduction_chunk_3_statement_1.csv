Explain how system complexity influences the required security measures for a standalone computer running a single user and a monoprogram.,"For a standalone computer operating with a single user and running a monoprogram, the primary security measure required is physical security. Physical security refers to the protection of hardware, software, and data from physical threats, such as theft, damage, or unauthorized access to the physical machine itself. This configuration represents the lowest level of system complexity discussed, thus requiring the most basic set of security provisions."
Describe the security measures necessary for a standalone computer used by a single user but running multiple programs.,"A standalone computer used by a single user but running multiple programs requires two main security measures: physical security and process protection. Physical security involves safeguarding the hardware, software, and data from physical threats like theft or unauthorized access. Process protection, on the other hand, ensures that individual programs or processes running concurrently on the system cannot interfere with each other or access unauthorized resources, thereby maintaining system integrity and preventing malicious or erroneous program behavior from affecting other processes."
What security measures are essential for a standalone computer that supports multiple users?,"For a standalone computer supporting multiple users, the essential security measures include physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. Physical security protects the hardware and data from physical threats. Process protection ensures that different user processes do not interfere with each other. Data protection safeguards user data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion by other users or processes. User authentication is crucial for verifying the identity of each user attempting to access the system, ensuring that only authorized individuals can log in and utilize resources."
Detail the comprehensive security requirements for a networked computer system.,"A networked computer system demands a comprehensive set of security requirements due to its increased complexity and connectivity. These include physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection. Physical security safeguards the hardware and data from physical threats. Process protection ensures that individual processes or programs do not interfere with each other. Data protection secures data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. User authentication verifies the identity of users accessing the system. Communication protection is vital for networked systems, as it secures data transmitted over the network from eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized interception, often through encryption and secure protocols."
Summarize the general principle illustrated by the progression of security measures from a monoprogram standalone computer to a networked computer.,"The progression of security measures, from a monoprogram standalone computer to a networked computer, illustrates the principle that system complexity leads to insecurity. As the complexity of a system increases—by adding multiprogram capabilities, multiple users, or network connectivity—the number and sophistication of potential vulnerabilities also increase. Consequently, a more extensive and layered set of security measures becomes necessary to provide a protected environment for data and its processing, encompassing physical, process, data, user authentication, and communication protections."
Identify the primary human factors that contribute to insecurity from the perspective of system users.,"From the perspective of system users, the primary human factors contributing to insecurity are the incorrect use of security features, such as misconfiguration, and the tendency of users to prioritize convenience. Users may disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient, even if those configurations are critical for maintaining system security. This behavior can inadvertently create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit."
How do system developers contribute to insecurity through human factors?,"System developers contribute to insecurity through human factors in two main ways: security features may not be designed correctly, and security components may not be implemented correctly. Furthermore, developers are humans and, as such, are prone to making mistakes during the design and implementation phases. These errors can introduce vulnerabilities into the system, regardless of the developers' intentions, leading to potential security breaches."
Explain how external parties can introduce insecurity into a system.,"External parties can introduce insecurity into a system primarily by manipulating an individual's trust for profit. This manipulation is commonly referred to as social engineering. Social engineering involves psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. By exploiting human trust and psychological vulnerabilities, external parties can bypass technical security controls and gain unauthorized access to systems or data."
What are the three main components of the 'Basics of Cyber Security' as outlined?,"The three main components of the 'Basics of Cyber Security' as outlined are the Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security. The Threat Model involves understanding adversaries, trusted components, and security goals. Security Strategies are the approaches taken to protect systems. Design Principles of Computer Security are the fundamental rules and guidelines for building secure systems."
List the elements that constitute a Threat Model in cyber security.,"A Threat Model in cyber security is constituted by three key elements: the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), Attacker's assumption, and Security properties. The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) refers to the set of components that are trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. Attacker's assumption involves defining the characteristics, capabilities, and knowledge of potential adversaries. Security properties are the specific security goals the system aims to achieve, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
Define what a Threat Model is in the context of cyber security.,"In the context of cyber security, a Threat Model is a structured approach used to describe the adversaries and threats under consideration for a system. It involves identifying what parts of the system are trusted and what are not (the Trusted Computing Base or TCB), understanding the resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities (attackers), and specifying the security properties the system aims to achieve. The purpose is to systematically identify potential threats and vulnerabilities to design effective security measures."
What aspects of untrusted entities must be considered when developing a Threat Model?,"When developing a Threat Model, several aspects of untrusted entities must be considered. These include their resources, capabilities, and knowledge. Resources refer to the assets or tools an attacker might possess. Capabilities describe what actions an attacker can perform, such as modifying data or injecting code. Knowledge pertains to what information an attacker might have about the system's design, architecture, or source code. Understanding these aspects helps in anticipating potential attacks and designing appropriate defenses."
What role do security properties play in a Threat Model?,"In a Threat Model, security properties define what the system aims to achieve in terms of security. These properties are the specific goals or attributes that the system must maintain to be considered secure, such as confidentiality (preventing unauthorized disclosure of information), integrity (preventing unauthorized modification of information), and availability (ensuring authorized users can access information and resources when needed). Clearly defining these properties helps guide the design of security mechanisms and evaluate their effectiveness against identified threats."
Explain the concept of 'Trust' in a cyber system.,"In a cyber system, 'Trust' refers to the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a certain way. This expectation encompasses both what the entity is expected to do (e.g., anti-malware detecting malicious programs, a system preventing illegal account logins) and what the entity is expected not to do (e.g., a website not exposing private data to third parties, an application not injecting viruses into the system). Establishing clear trust boundaries and expectations is fundamental, as security cannot be established if no entities are trusted, and unclear trust assumptions can lead to security solution failures."
Provide examples of what an entity is 'expected to do' in the context of trust.,"In the context of trust within a cyber system, examples of what an entity is 'expected to do' include: an anti-malware program being expected to detect malicious programs, and a system being expected to prevent illegal account logins. These expectations define the positive, protective, or functional behaviors that are relied upon for the system's security and operation."
Provide examples of what an entity is 'expected not to do' in the context of trust.,"In the context of trust within a cyber system, examples of what an entity is 'expected not to do' include: a website being expected not to expose your private data to third parties, and an application being expected not to inject viruses into your system. These expectations define the negative constraints or forbidden behaviors that are relied upon for maintaining privacy, integrity, and overall system security."
Why is it crucial to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is crucial to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities are trusted. Without clear trust definitions, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. Ambiguity about which components or entities are reliable can lead to vulnerabilities, as security mechanisms might be built upon faulty assumptions, or critical components might be left unprotected due to an unclear understanding of their trustworthiness."
Define the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, which can include software, operating systems (OS), firmware, and hardware, that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. These components are critical because their correct and secure operation is fundamental to the overall security posture of the entire system. If any component within the TCB is compromised, the security of the entire system is at risk."
What is the implication of components being outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The implication of components being outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that they can be malicious and misbehave. Since the TCB comprises the components that are explicitly trusted for system security, anything outside of it is considered potentially untrustworthy. Therefore, security solutions must be designed to prevent any damages or malicious actions originating from these external, untrusted components."
What two key considerations are necessary when designing a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution concerning the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), two key considerations are necessary: First, all components inside the TCB must be assumed to be secure, with valid justifications for this assumption. Second, the design must prevent any damages from any components outside of the TCB. This dual approach ensures that the core trusted elements are robust and that external, potentially malicious elements cannot compromise the system."
Describe the 'Unbypassable' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Unbypassable' principle, also referred to as completeness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations and data paths must go through the TCB, ensuring that its security mechanisms are always in effect and cannot be circumvented by an attacker. If the TCB can be bypassed, its security guarantees become irrelevant."
Explain the 'Tamper-resistant' principle in TCB design.,"The 'Tamper-resistant' principle, also known as security, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. This protection ensures that these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state. The integrity of the TCB is paramount, and tamper resistance prevents unauthorized alterations that could compromise its trustworthiness and, consequently, the entire system's security."
What does the 'Verifiable' principle mean for TCB design?,"The 'Verifiable' principle, also known as correctness, for Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis, testing, and formal methods to demonstrate that it behaves as expected and correctly enforces its security policies. Verifiability is crucial for building confidence in the TCB's trustworthiness."
How does the size of the TCB relate to its trustworthiness and verifiability?,"The size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) directly relates to its trustworthiness and verifiability: a system with a smaller TCB is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components, and these assumptions are less likely to be violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, suggesting that simplicity reduces the attack surface and complexity, making it easier to ensure security. Conversely, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB can be more challenging as it requires considering more malicious entities outside the trusted core."
What is the KISS principle and how does it apply to TCB size?,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is a design philosophy that advocates for simplicity in design and avoiding unnecessary complexity. It applies to Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size by suggesting that a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify. A smaller, simpler TCB means fewer components to scrutinize, fewer potential vulnerabilities, and fewer assumptions that need to hold true for the system to remain secure. This reduces the likelihood of errors or exploitable flaws within the trusted core."
What are the two main types of attackers considered in an Attacker's Assumption model?,"In an Attacker's Assumption model, the two main types of attackers considered are active attackers and passive attackers. An active attacker is one who manipulates or disrupts the systems, for example, by modifying data or injecting code. A passive attacker, on the other hand, focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation, such as eavesdropping on communications."
Differentiate between an 'Active' and a 'Passive' attacker.,"An 'Active' attacker is characterized by their intent and ability to manipulate or disrupt systems. This includes actions like modifying data, injecting malicious code, or altering system behavior. In contrast, a 'Passive' attacker's primary goal is to observe and gather information without interfering with the system's operation. They might monitor network traffic, collect credentials, or analyze system logs, all without making any changes that would alert the system or users to their presence."
What aspects of an attacker's knowledge are considered in a Threat Model?,"In a Threat Model, an attacker's knowledge is considered in two primary ways: first, whether they know the system's design, architecture, source code, and other intricate details; and second, whether they lack detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error. Understanding the assumed level of an attacker's knowledge helps in assessing the sophistication of potential attacks and designing defenses that are robust against both informed and less informed adversaries."
What factors are considered when assessing an attacker's capability?,"When assessing an attacker's capability, several factors are considered. These include how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, such as processing power or storage. It also involves identifying what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, determining their access points and potential scope of influence. Finally, the assessment considers whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly, which can influence the types of attacks they might employ and the resources they can commit."
How does the concept of 'System Complexity Leads to Insecurity' relate to the need for different security measures?,"The concept 'System Complexity Leads to Insecurity' directly relates to the need for different security measures by demonstrating that as a system's functionality and interconnectedness increase, so do its potential vulnerabilities and attack surface. For instance, a simple monoprogram standalone computer primarily needs physical security. However, introducing multiprogramming necessitates process protection, adding multiple users requires data protection and user authentication, and networking demands communication protection. Each layer of complexity introduces new vectors for attack, thus requiring additional, specialized security measures to maintain a protected environment for data and processing."
Why is 'misconfiguration' a significant human factor leading to insecurity?,"Misconfiguration is a significant human factor leading to insecurity because it represents a failure to correctly use security features. Even if a system has robust security mechanisms, if they are not configured properly—for example, by using default passwords, leaving unnecessary services enabled, or setting overly permissive access controls—these mechanisms become ineffective. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that attackers can leverage, often without needing to bypass complex technical defenses."
How does the desire for 'convenience' by users impact system security?,"The desire for 'convenience' by users significantly impacts system security because users may try to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient. This could involve choosing weaker passwords, bypassing multi-factor authentication, or turning off firewalls or antivirus software to streamline their workflow. While these actions might make the system easier to use in the short term, they often compromise critical security layers, making the system more vulnerable to attacks and increasing the risk of data breaches or system compromise."
What are the implications of developers being 'humans' in terms of system security?,"The implication of developers being 'humans' in terms of system security is that humans can make mistakes. This means that even with the best intentions, security features may not be designed correctly, or security components may not be implemented correctly. These errors, whether in logic, coding, or understanding of security principles, can introduce vulnerabilities into the software or system, which can later be exploited by attackers. Recognizing this human fallibility is crucial for implementing robust testing, code reviews, and secure development lifecycle practices."
What is social engineering and why is it a concern for external parties?,"Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. It is a significant concern for external parties because it allows them to bypass technical security measures by manipulating an individual's trust for profit. Instead of hacking into systems, attackers trick people into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security, making it a highly effective and difficult-to-defend-against attack vector."
Why is it important to consider 'Attacker's assumption' when designing cyber security?,"It is important to consider 'Attacker's assumption' when designing cyber security because it helps in understanding the potential adversaries, their motivations, capabilities, and knowledge. By making explicit assumptions about who the attackers might be and what they can do, security designers can anticipate threats more effectively, prioritize defenses, and allocate resources to protect against the most relevant and impactful attack scenarios. This proactive approach ensures that security measures are tailored to realistic threats rather than generic ones."
How does the 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' relate to the overall 'Threat Model'?,"The 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' is a fundamental component of the overall 'Threat Model'. The Threat Model describes the adversaries and threats, and a key part of this description is identifying what is trusted and what is not trusted within the system. The TCB explicitly defines the set of components (software, OS, firmware, hardware) that are assumed to be secure and whose correct operation is essential for the system's security. By clearly delineating the TCB, the Threat Model can then focus on threats originating from outside the TCB and how to protect the system from them, as well as ensuring the TCB itself meets its security properties."
What are the implications if the components inside the TCB are not secure?,"If the components inside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are not secure, it has severe implications for the entire system's security. The TCB is the foundation of trust; if it is compromised, all security guarantees built upon it become invalid. An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system, bypass all security mechanisms, access sensitive data, or disrupt operations, as the very core components relied upon for security are themselves untrustworthy. This underscores the critical need for valid justifications and rigorous verification of TCB components."
Why is a smaller TCB considered more trustworthy?,"A smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is considered more trustworthy because it reduces the number of components that need to be assumed secure. With fewer components, there are fewer potential points of failure, fewer lines of code to audit, and fewer complex interactions to verify. This makes the TCB easier to analyze, test, and formally verify for correctness, leading to a higher degree of confidence in its security. It minimizes the number of assumptions that could potentially be violated, thereby enhancing overall system trustworthiness."
What challenges arise when designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"While a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is more trustworthy and easier to verify, designing a secure system with a smaller TCB presents its own challenges. The primary challenge is that it requires considering more malicious entities. By shrinking the trusted core, more components are pushed outside the TCB, meaning they are considered potentially untrustworthy. This necessitates more robust mechanisms to isolate and protect the TCB from these numerous external, potentially malicious entities, making the overall system design more complex in terms of containment and defense."
How can an active attacker typically disrupt systems?,"An active attacker typically disrupts systems by manipulating or altering their state. This can involve actions such as modifying data, which could lead to incorrect information or system malfunction, or injecting code, which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or introduce malicious functionalities. These disruptive actions aim to compromise the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the system and its data."
What is the primary objective of a passive attacker?,"The primary objective of a passive attacker is observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. Unlike active attackers who modify or disrupt, passive attackers aim to remain undetected while collecting sensitive data, understanding system behavior, or identifying vulnerabilities. This could involve eavesdropping on network communications, analyzing traffic patterns, or monitoring system activities to extract valuable intelligence without leaving a trace of their presence."
"How does an attacker's knowledge of 'system design, architecture, source code' influence security design?","An attacker's knowledge of 'system design, architecture, source code' significantly influences security design because it implies a highly sophisticated adversary who can identify specific vulnerabilities, understand how security mechanisms are implemented, and devise targeted exploits. When designing security, assuming such knowledge necessitates a focus on robust, layered defenses, secure coding practices, and thorough vulnerability assessments, as simple obfuscation or reliance on security through obscurity would be ineffective against such an informed attacker."
What are the implications if an attacker 'lacks detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error'?,"If an attacker 'lacks detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error,' it implies a less sophisticated adversary. This influences security design by suggesting that basic security measures, such as strong authentication, rate limiting, intrusion detection systems, and clear error messages (or lack thereof), can be effective in deterring or detecting such attacks. The system can be designed to make probing difficult, to log failed attempts, and to present minimal information that could aid an attacker in their trial-and-error process, thereby increasing the effort and time required for a successful breach."
Why is it important to consider 'how much computing resources can the attacker leverage'?,"It is important to consider 'how much computing resources can the attacker leverage' because this directly impacts the feasibility and speed of certain attacks. For instance, an attacker with significant computing resources can perform brute-force attacks on passwords or cryptographic keys much faster than one with limited resources. This consideration helps in designing appropriate cryptographic strengths, rate-limiting mechanisms, and other defenses that can withstand attacks from adversaries with substantial computational power, ensuring that the cost of attack outweighs the potential gain."
How does understanding 'what parts of the system the attacker can interact with' inform security measures?,"Understanding 'what parts of the system the attacker can interact with' is crucial because it defines the attack surface and potential entry points. This knowledge informs security measures by allowing designers to prioritize protection for exposed interfaces, APIs, network ports, and user input fields. It helps in implementing strong input validation, access controls, and monitoring specifically at these interaction points, thereby reducing the likelihood of successful exploitation and limiting the scope of potential damage if a breach occurs."
What is the significance of considering whether an attacker has 'unlimited time or need to act quickly'?,"The significance of considering whether an attacker has 'unlimited time or need to act quickly' lies in its impact on the type of attacks that are feasible and the detection strategies employed. An attacker with unlimited time can conduct slow, stealthy, and persistent attacks, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) or sophisticated reconnaissance, which are harder to detect. Conversely, an attacker needing to act quickly might resort to noisier, more easily detectable methods like rapid scanning or brute-force attacks. This distinction influences the design of monitoring systems, incident response plans, and the implementation of time-sensitive security controls like session timeouts or cryptographic key rotation schedules."
What is the overarching goal when providing a protected environment for data and its processing?,"The overarching goal when providing a protected environment for data and its processing is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and system resources. This involves safeguarding data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction, and ensuring that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed. Achieving this goal requires implementing a combination of physical, logical, and administrative security measures tailored to the system's complexity and the threats it faces."
How does 'Data protection' differ from 'Process protection' in a multi-user standalone computer?,"In a multi-user standalone computer, 'Data protection' focuses on safeguarding the actual information stored on the system from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion by other users or processes. This involves access control lists, encryption, and data segregation. 'Process protection,' on the other hand, ensures that individual programs or processes running on the system, potentially belonging to different users, cannot interfere with each other's execution, memory space, or resources. While both contribute to overall security, data protection is about the information itself, and process protection is about the isolation and integrity of running applications."
Why is 'User authentication' critical for a multi-user standalone computer?,"User authentication is critical for a multi-user standalone computer because it provides the fundamental mechanism to verify the identity of each individual attempting to access the system. By requiring users to prove who they are (e.g., via passwords, biometrics, or tokens), user authentication ensures that only authorized individuals can log in, access their specific data, and utilize system resources. Without it, any user could potentially impersonate another, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and a complete breakdown of accountability and security."
What specific threats does 'Communication protection' address in a networked computer?,"Communication protection in a networked computer specifically addresses threats related to the transmission of data over a network. These threats include eavesdropping (unauthorized interception of data), tampering (unauthorized modification of data during transit), and replay attacks (re-sending legitimate data to achieve an unauthorized effect). Communication protection mechanisms, such as encryption, secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL), and integrity checks, are designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data as it travels between networked devices."
What is the primary purpose of 'Security Strategies' in cyber security?,"The primary purpose of 'Security Strategies' in cyber security is to outline the overarching approaches and plans taken to protect systems, data, and networks from threats. These strategies guide the selection and implementation of specific security controls, technologies, and policies, ensuring that security efforts are aligned with organizational goals, risk tolerance, and the identified threat landscape. They provide a framework for making informed decisions about how to defend against attacks and manage security risks effectively."
What are 'Design Principles of Computer Security'?,"'Design Principles of Computer Security' are the fundamental rules and guidelines that inform the architectural and implementation choices for building secure computer systems. These principles, such as least privilege, defense in depth, fail-safe defaults, and separation of duties, aim to create systems that are inherently more resilient to attacks, easier to verify, and more robust in maintaining their security properties even in the face of errors or malicious activity. They serve as a foundational framework for secure system development."
How does the concept of 'Trust' influence the design of security solutions?,"The concept of 'Trust' profoundly influences the design of security solutions by requiring a clear delineation of what components, entities, and behaviors are expected to be reliable and what are not. Security solutions are designed by making explicit assumptions about trusted components (like the TCB) and then building defenses to protect against untrusted entities. If trust assumptions are unclear or violated, security solutions can fail. Therefore, security design must carefully define trust boundaries, verify trusted components, and implement robust mechanisms to isolate and protect against untrusted elements."
Why is it important to have 'valid justifications' for assuming components inside the TCB are secure?,"It is important to have 'valid justifications' for assuming components inside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are secure because the entire security of the system hinges on the trustworthiness of the TCB. Without rigorous justification—such as formal verification, extensive testing, code reviews, or adherence to secure development standards—the assumption of security is merely a leap of faith. Valid justifications provide the evidence and assurance that these critical components are indeed free from vulnerabilities and behave as expected, thereby establishing a credible foundation for the system's overall security posture."
What is the role of 'Attacker's knowledge' in shaping security defenses?,"The role of 'Attacker's knowledge' in shaping security defenses is to inform the level of sophistication and type of attacks that need to be defended against. If attackers are assumed to have detailed knowledge (e.g., system design, source code), defenses must be robust, layered, and not rely on obscurity. If attackers are assumed to lack detailed knowledge and rely on trial and error, defenses can focus on detection, logging, and making probing difficult. Understanding this helps tailor security measures to be effective against the most probable and impactful threats, optimizing resource allocation."
How does 'Physical security' contribute to the overall security of a computer system?,"Physical security contributes to the overall security of a computer system by protecting the hardware, software, and data from physical threats. This includes preventing unauthorized access to the physical machine, safeguarding against theft of devices or components, and protecting against environmental damage (e.g., fire, water). By controlling physical access and protecting the physical infrastructure, physical security forms the foundational layer upon which all other logical and software-based security measures depend, as a compromised physical machine can render other security controls ineffective."
