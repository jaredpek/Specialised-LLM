"Analyse the concept of ""System Complexity Leads to Insecurity"" as presented in the document.","System complexity leads to insecurity by requiring an increasing number of security measures as the system evolves from a simple standalone monoprogram computer to a complex networked computer. For a standalone computer with a single user and a monoprogram, only physical security is listed as a necessary protection. As the system becomes a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs, process protection is added. When it becomes a standalone computer with multiple users, data protection and user authentication are further introduced. Finally, for a networked computer, communication protection is added to the existing measures of physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. This progression illustrates that as system complexity increases, the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities expand, necessitating a more comprehensive and layered approach to security to provide a protected environment for data and their processing."
What are the security measures required for a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram?,"For a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram, the primary security measure required is physical security. Physical security refers to the protection of hardware, software, and data from physical threats, such as theft, damage, or unauthorized access to the physical device itself."
Describe the additional security measures needed when a standalone computer transitions from a single-user monoprogram to a single-user multiprogram environment.,"When a standalone computer transitions from a single-user monoprogram to a single-user multiprogram environment, process protection is added to the existing physical security. Process protection refers to mechanisms that ensure that different programs or processes running concurrently on the system do not interfere with each other's memory, resources, or execution, thereby preventing one malicious or faulty program from compromising the entire system."
Explain the security requirements for a standalone computer supporting multiple users.,"A standalone computer supporting multiple users requires physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. Data protection involves measures to safeguard data from corruption, compromise, or loss, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like passwords or biometrics, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the system and its resources."
What are the comprehensive security measures for a networked computer?,"For a networked computer, the comprehensive security measures include physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection. Communication protection involves securing data as it is transmitted over a network, typically through encryption and secure protocols, to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized access during transit."
How do System Users contribute to insecurity?,"System users contribute to insecurity in two primary ways: first, by not using security features correctly, which can manifest as misconfiguration; and second, by prioritizing convenience, leading them to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient. Misconfiguration refers to incorrect settings or setup of security controls, which can leave vulnerabilities open for exploitation."
In what ways do System Developers introduce insecurity?,"System developers introduce insecurity through two main avenues: first, by incorrectly designing security features or improperly implementing security components; and second, because developers are humans and, as such, are prone to making mistakes during the design and implementation processes."
How can External Parties lead to insecurity?,"External parties can lead to insecurity primarily by manipulating an individual's trust for profit, a practice commonly known as social engineering. Social engineering is a psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, often exploiting human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities."
Define the concept of a Threat Model in cyber security.,"A Threat Model in cyber security describes the adversaries and threats under consideration for a system. It involves identifying what components are trusted and what are not trusted (known as the Trusted Computing Base or TCB), understanding the resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities, and determining what actions these untrusted entities can perform. Furthermore, it specifies the security properties that the system aims to achieve."
What are the key elements considered within a Threat Model?,"The key elements considered within a Threat Model include the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the attacker's assumptions, and the security properties the system aims to achieve. The TCB refers to the set of components that are trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. Attacker's assumptions detail the characteristics and capabilities of potential adversaries. Security properties are the desired attributes of the system that ensure its protection, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
"Explain the concept of ""Trust"" in the context of cyber systems.","Trust in the context of cyber systems refers to the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a certain manner. This includes defining what the entity is expected to do, such as anti-malware detecting malicious programs or a system preventing illegal account logins, and what the entity is expected not to do, such as a website not exposing private data to third parties or an application not injecting viruses into the system. Establishing clear trust is crucial because security cannot be established in a cyber system if no entities are trusted, and without clear definitions of trust, designed security solutions may fail in practice."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected to do"" based on trust.","Based on trust, an entity is expected to do actions such as anti-malware detecting malicious programs and a system preventing illegal account logins. Anti-malware is software designed to prevent, detect, and remove malicious software. Preventing illegal account login refers to security mechanisms that stop unauthorized attempts to access user accounts."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected not to do"" based on trust.","Based on trust, an entity is expected not to do actions such as a website exposing private data to third parties or an application injecting viruses into a system. Exposing private data to third parties means sharing confidential user information with unauthorized external entities. Injecting viruses into a system refers to introducing malicious code that can replicate itself and spread to other programs or systems, causing damage or disruption."
Why is it important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities are trusted. If the boundaries of trust are not clear, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. This clarity ensures that security mechanisms are appropriately applied and that assumptions about component behavior are well-founded."
Define the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, which can include software, operating systems (OS), firmware, and hardware, that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. Components outside of the TCB are considered potentially malicious and capable of misbehaving."
What considerations are crucial when designing a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution, two crucial considerations concerning the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are: first, assuming all components inside the TCB are secure, provided there are valid justifications for this assumption; and second, implementing measures to prevent any damages from components located outside of the TCB."
"Describe the ""Unbypassable"" design principle for TCB.","The ""Unbypassable"" design principle for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also referred to as completeness, dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations and data flows must pass through and be controlled by the TCB, ensuring that its security mechanisms cannot be circumvented."
"Explain the ""Tamper-resistant"" design principle for TCB.","The ""Tamper-resistant"" design principle for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also referred to as security, states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. This protection ensures that these external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state, thereby preserving its integrity and preventing unauthorized alterations that could compromise system security."
"What does the ""Verifiable"" design principle for TCB entail?","The ""Verifiable"" design principle for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also known as correctness, entails that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This means that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis and proof, allowing for assurance that it functions as intended and meets its security objectives without flaws."
Discuss the relationship between the size of the TCB and trustworthiness.,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally considered more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components, reducing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated. This concept aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which advocates for simplicity to enhance reliability and security."
What are the challenges associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is more challenging because it necessitates considering a greater number of malicious entities. With fewer components within the trusted boundary, more external entities are assumed to be potentially hostile, requiring more robust and comprehensive security mechanisms to protect the system from their potential actions."
Describe the two main types of attackers based on their actions.,"The two main types of attackers based on their actions are active attackers and passive attackers. An active attacker is one who manipulates or disrupts systems, for example, by modifying data or injecting code. A passive attacker, in contrast, focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operation."
Differentiate between an active and a passive attacker.,"An active attacker is characterized by their ability to manipulate or disrupt systems, engaging in actions such as modifying data or injecting code. Conversely, a passive attacker's primary objective is observing and gathering information without actively interfering with the system. The key distinction lies in the active attacker's capacity for system alteration versus the passive attacker's non-interfering surveillance."
"What aspects of ""Attacker's knowledge"" are considered in a threat model?","In a threat model, ""Attacker's knowledge"" considers whether the attacker knows the system's design, architecture, and source code. It also considers if the attacker lacks detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error to understand the system."
"What factors are assessed under ""Attacker's capability""?","Under ""Attacker's capability,"" factors assessed include how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, and whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly. These factors help in understanding the potential scope and intensity of an attack."
How does misconfiguration by system users lead to insecurity?,"Misconfiguration by system users leads to insecurity because security features are not used correctly. When security settings are improperly configured, they can create vulnerabilities or leave parts of the system unprotected, even if the underlying security features are robust. This incorrect setup can be exploited by adversaries."
Explain how user preference for convenience can compromise system security.,"User preference for convenience can compromise system security because users may try to disable security configurations that they find inconvenient. Disabling these configurations, even if they seem minor, can weaken the overall security posture of the system, creating potential entry points or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers."
What are the implications of security components not being implemented correctly by developers?,"The implications of security components not being implemented correctly by developers are significant, as it means that the security features are not designed correctly. This can lead to flaws in the system's defenses, making it vulnerable to attacks even if the design principles were sound. Incorrect implementation can introduce bugs, logical errors, or bypasses that compromise the intended security."
Why is human error a factor in system insecurity from a developer's perspective?,"Human error is a factor in system insecurity from a developer's perspective because developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes. These mistakes can occur during any phase of development, from design to coding to testing, leading to vulnerabilities, incorrect security logic, or oversights that can be exploited by malicious actors."
What is social engineering and how does it relate to external parties causing insecurity?,"Social engineering is a technique where an individual's trust is manipulated for profit. It relates to external parties causing insecurity because these parties exploit human psychology, rather than technical vulnerabilities, to gain unauthorized access to systems or information. By deceiving individuals, external parties can bypass security measures that rely on user vigilance."
What are the three main categories of factors that lead to insecurity?,"The three main categories of factors that lead to insecurity are System Complexity, Human Factors, and the lack of a robust Threat Model. System Complexity leads to insecurity by requiring more extensive and layered security measures as systems grow. Human Factors, involving both System Users and System Developers, introduce insecurity through misconfiguration, convenience-driven disabling of security, incorrect design/implementation, and human error. External Parties, through social engineering, also contribute to human factors leading to insecurity. A well-defined Threat Model is essential to understand and mitigate these insecurities."
"How does the concept of ""Trusted Computing Base"" relate to the overall ""Computer System"" and ""Security Properties"" in a threat model?","In a threat model, the ""Trusted Computing Base"" (TCB) is a critical subset of the overall ""Computer System"" that is assumed to be secure and correct. The TCB interacts with ""Attacker's assumptions"" to define the boundaries of trust. The relationship is that the TCB is relied upon to enforce the ""Security Properties"" that the system aims to achieve. Essentially, the TCB is the foundation upon which the system's security is built, and its integrity is paramount for the system to uphold its desired security properties against potential threats defined by attacker assumptions."
"What is the significance of ""Attacker's assumptions"" in a threat model?","""Attacker's assumptions"" are significant in a threat model because they describe the characteristics of the adversaries and their potential capabilities, knowledge, and resources. By making explicit assumptions about attackers, security designers can better understand the types of threats the system needs to defend against, what actions attackers might perform, and consequently, what security properties the system must achieve to withstand those threats."
How does the document suggest we should approach components outside the TCB when designing a security solution?,"When designing a security solution, the document suggests that components outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) should be considered potentially malicious and capable of misbehaving. Therefore, a crucial approach is to prevent any damages from these components outside of the TCB. This implies implementing robust isolation, validation, and protection mechanisms to contain and mitigate risks posed by untrusted elements."
Explain the KISS principle in the context of TCB size.,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, in the context of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size, suggests that a smaller TCB is more desirable. A smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify because it requires fewer assumptions about its components. This simplicity reduces the complexity of the trusted part of the system, making it less prone to errors and easier to assure its correctness, thereby enhancing overall security."
What are the implications if a system's TCB is not unbypassable?,"If a system's Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is not unbypassable, it means that system security can be breached by circumventing the TCB. This directly violates the completeness principle of TCB design. An attacker could find a way to perform security-critical operations or access sensitive data without interacting with the trusted components, rendering the TCB's security controls ineffective and compromising the entire system."
What are the consequences if a system's TCB is not tamper-resistant?,"If a system's Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is not tamper-resistant, it means that other parts outside the TCB could modify its code or state. This violates the security principle of TCB design. The consequence is that an attacker could alter the TCB's behavior, introduce vulnerabilities, or disable security mechanisms, thereby gaining control over the system's security foundation and compromising its integrity."
Why is it important for a TCB to be verifiable?,"It is important for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to be verifiable because this ensures its correctness. Verifiability allows for the possibility of rigorously checking and proving that the TCB functions exactly as intended and meets its security specifications. Without verifiability, there is no strong assurance that the TCB is free from flaws or vulnerabilities, which could undermine the entire system's security."
How does an attacker's knowledge of system design impact a threat model?,"An attacker's knowledge of system design, architecture, and source code significantly impacts a threat model by allowing for more targeted and sophisticated attacks. If an attacker possesses this detailed knowledge, they can identify specific vulnerabilities, understand system logic, and devise precise exploits, making the system more susceptible to compromise. This knowledge informs the types of defenses that need to be prioritized."
What are the implications if an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system?,"If an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system, the implications are that they must rely on probing or trial and error to understand it. This means their attacks might be less efficient, more detectable, and potentially less successful. Security measures can be designed to detect and deter such exploratory attempts, buying time for defense and response."
How do computing resources of an attacker influence the threat landscape?,"The computing resources an attacker can leverage significantly influence the threat landscape by determining the scale and complexity of attacks they can mount. Greater computing resources enable brute-force attacks, faster decryption, and more sophisticated distributed attacks, potentially overwhelming system defenses. This factor helps in assessing the feasibility of certain attack types."
Why is understanding which parts of the system an attacker can interact with important?,"Understanding which parts of the system an attacker can interact with is important because it defines the potential attack surface. This knowledge allows security designers to prioritize protection for those accessible components and interfaces, implementing stronger controls where interaction is possible, and minimizing exposure to reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation."
How does the attacker's time constraint (unlimited vs. quick action) affect security considerations?,"The attacker's time constraint, whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly, significantly affects security considerations. If an attacker has unlimited time, they can conduct persistent, slow, and stealthy attacks, making detection harder. If they need to act quickly, defenses can focus on rapid detection and response to thwart time-sensitive exploits. This factor influences the design of monitoring, alerting, and response mechanisms."
What is the fundamental principle for providing a protected environment for data and their processing?,"The fundamental principle for providing a protected environment for data and their processing is to implement a layered set of security measures that evolve with increasing system complexity. This includes physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection, ensuring that as systems become more intricate and interconnected, the protective environment expands to cover new vulnerabilities."
"How does the concept of ""security properties"" fit into the overall threat model?","""Security properties"" fit into the overall threat model as the specific goals or attributes that the system aims to achieve to ensure its protection. These properties, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability, are the desired outcomes that the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is designed to enforce, in light of the identified adversaries and their assumptions. They define what a secure state looks like for the system."
"What are the general categories of ""Basics of Cyber Security"" outlined in the document?","The general categories of ""Basics of Cyber Security"" outlined in the document are Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security. The Threat Model involves understanding adversaries, trusted components, and security properties. Security Strategies refer to the overarching plans for protecting systems. Design Principles of Computer Security are the fundamental rules and guidelines for building secure systems."
"Why is it crucial to consider ""Attacker's knowledge"" when developing security strategies?","It is crucial to consider ""Attacker's knowledge"" when developing security strategies because it informs the level of sophistication and type of attacks that can be expected. If attackers are known to have detailed system knowledge, strategies must focus on robust, unbypassable, and tamper-resistant controls. If they lack detailed knowledge, strategies can include measures to detect probing and trial-and-error attempts, making it harder for them to gain understanding."
How does the evolution of computer systems from monoprogram to networked impact the required security measures?,"The evolution of computer systems from monoprogram to networked significantly impacts the required security measures by progressively increasing their scope and complexity. A monoprogram system primarily needs physical security. As it becomes multiprogram, process protection is added. With multiple users, data protection and user authentication become necessary. Finally, for networked systems, communication protection is essential, alongside all previous measures. This demonstrates that each increase in system complexity introduces new vectors for insecurity, demanding additional layers of protection."
What is the primary objective of providing a protected environment for data and their processing?,"The primary objective of providing a protected environment for data and their processing is to mitigate the insecurity that arises from system complexity. By implementing a comprehensive set of security measures, such as physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection, the aim is to safeguard information and computational operations from unauthorized access, modification, or disruption, ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, and availability."
"Summarize the core message regarding ""Human Factors Lead to Insecurity.""","The core message regarding ""Human Factors Lead to Insecurity"" is that human actions and characteristics, across different roles, introduce significant vulnerabilities into systems. System users contribute through misconfiguration or by disabling security for convenience. System developers introduce flaws through incorrect design, improper implementation, or simply by making human mistakes. Furthermore, external parties exploit human trust through social engineering, demonstrating that human elements are a critical and often exploited weak link in the security chain."
