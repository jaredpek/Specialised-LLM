Compare the security requirements for a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram versus a standalone computer with a single user running a multiprogram.,"A **standalone computer single user monoprogram** primarily requires **Physical security**. This refers to measures designed to protect physical assets from unauthorized access or damage. In contrast, a **standalone computer single user multiprogram** requires both **Physical security** and **Process protection**. **Process protection** involves mechanisms to isolate and protect individual processes from interfering with each other or the operating system, which becomes necessary when multiple programs are running concurrently on the same system."
What are the differences in security protections needed for a standalone computer with a single user running a multiprogram versus a standalone computer with multiple users?,"For a **standalone computer single user multiprogram**, the required security protections are **Physical security** and **Process protection**. **Physical security** safeguards the hardware from unauthorized access, while **Process protection** ensures that concurrently running programs do not interfere with each other or the system. \n\nHowever, a **standalone computer multiple user** system demands a more extensive set of protections: **Physical security**, **Process protection**, **Data protection**, and **User authentication**. In addition to physical and process safeguards, **Data protection** is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of data belonging to different users. **User authentication** is also essential to verify the identity of each user accessing the system, ensuring that only authorized individuals can gain access."
Compare the security measures required for a standalone computer with multiple users versus a networked computer.,"A **standalone computer multiple user** system requires **Physical security**, **Process protection**, **Data protection**, and **User authentication**. **Physical security** protects the hardware, **Process protection** isolates running programs, **Data protection** secures user data, and **User authentication** verifies user identities. \n\nIn contrast, a **networked computer** requires all these protections plus an additional layer: **Communication protection**. This means a networked computer needs **Physical security**, **Process protection**, **Data protection**, **User authentication**, and **Communication protection**. **Communication protection** involves securing data transmitted over a network, safeguarding it from eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized access during transit between connected systems."
What are the primary human factors that contribute to insecurity from the perspective of System Users?,"From the perspective of **System Users**, human factors lead to insecurity primarily through two mechanisms: \n\n1.  **Incorrect use of security features**: This often manifests as misconfiguration, where security settings or features are not set up correctly, leaving vulnerabilities open. \n2.  **Prioritizing convenience over security**: Users may disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses for ease of use."
Explain how System Developers contribute to insecurity.,"**System Developers** contribute to insecurity through several human factors: \n\n1.  **Incorrect design of security features**: Security features may not be conceptualized or architected in a robust manner from the outset. \n2.  **Incorrect implementation of security components**: Even if designed correctly, security components might be implemented with flaws or errors, leading to vulnerabilities. \n3.  **Human error**: Developers, being human, are prone to making mistakes during the design, coding, or testing phases, which can introduce security weaknesses into the system."
Define 'Threat Model' in the context of cyber security.,"A **Threat Model** in cyber security is a structured approach used to describe the adversaries and threats under consideration for a system. It involves identifying: \n\n1.  **What is trusted and what is not trusted (TCB)**: This defines the boundaries of the system's core trusted components. \n2.  **Untrusted entities' resources, capabilities, and knowledge**: For entities outside the trusted boundary, it specifies what resources they possess, what actions they can perform, and their level of knowledge about the system. \n3.  **Security properties the system aims to achieve**: These are the desired security goals, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability, that the system is designed to uphold against identified threats."
What are the key components that a Threat Model describes?,"A **Threat Model** describes three key components: \n\n1.  **What is trusted and what is not trusted (TCB)**: This establishes the scope of the Trusted Computing Base, which is a set of components assumed to be secure. \n2.  **Resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities**: For adversaries or components outside the TCB, the model outlines their potential assets, abilities, and understanding of the system, as well as the actions they can perform. \n3.  **Security properties the system aims to achieve**: These are the specific security objectives, such as confidentiality, integrity, or availability, that the system is designed to maintain against identified threats."
Define 'Trust' in the context of cyber systems.,"**Trust** in the context of cyber systems refers to the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a certain manner. This expectation encompasses two main aspects: \n\n1.  **What the entity is expected to do**: For example, an anti-malware program is trusted to detect malicious programs, or a system is trusted to prevent illegal account logins. \n2.  **What the entity is expected not to do**: For instance, a website is trusted not to expose private data to third parties, and an application is trusted not to inject viruses into the system. \n\nEstablishing clear trust boundaries is critical, as security cannot be achieved in a cyber system if no entities are trusted, and poorly defined trust can lead to security solution failures."
Why is it important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system because **security cannot be established if no entities are trusted**. Without a clear definition of trust, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. This clarity helps in identifying which components or entities are assumed to behave correctly and which are considered untrusted, allowing for appropriate security measures to be put in place to protect against the latter."
Define the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is defined as a set of components that need to be trusted to ensure the security of a cyber system. These components can include various elements such as software, the operating system (OS), firmware, and hardware. The fundamental assumption is that all components within the TCB are secure, and security solutions are designed to prevent damage from any components operating outside of this trusted base."
What are the implications of components being outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The implication of components being outside the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is that they **can be malicious and misbehave**. When designing a security solution, it is necessary to assume that all components inside the TCB are secure, provided there are valid justifications. Conversely, for components outside the TCB, security design must focus on preventing any damages that these potentially untrusted or malicious entities might cause to the system."
What are the design principles for a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The design principles for a **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** are: \n\n1.  **Unbypassable (completeness)**: This principle dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. The TCB must comprehensively cover all critical security functions. \n2.  **Tamper-resistant (security)**: The TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or state, ensuring its integrity. \n3.  **Verifiable (or correctness)**: It should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This means the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis and proof of its security properties."
Compare the characteristics of an 'Active' attacker versus a 'Passive' attacker.,"An **Active attacker** is characterized by their intent and actions to manipulate or disrupt systems. This includes activities such as modifying data or injecting code, directly interfering with the system's operation. \n\nIn contrast, a **Passive attacker** focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. Their actions do not directly alter the system's state or data, but rather involve monitoring communications or system behavior to extract sensitive information."
What are the different aspects of an attacker's knowledge that are considered in a threat model?,"In a threat model, an attacker's knowledge is considered in two main aspects: \n\n1.  **Detailed system knowledge**: This refers to an attacker who knows the system's design, architecture, source code, and other intricate details. Such knowledge allows for highly targeted and sophisticated attacks. \n2.  **Lack of detailed knowledge**: This describes an attacker who does not possess comprehensive system knowledge and, therefore, must rely on probing, trial and error, or other exploratory methods to discover vulnerabilities or gain information."
What factors are considered when assessing an attacker's capability?,"When assessing an attacker's capability, several factors are considered: \n\n1.  **Computing resources**: This includes how much computing power or infrastructure the attacker can leverage for their operations. \n2.  **System interaction**: This refers to what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, defining their potential points of entry and influence. \n3.  **Time constraints**: This evaluates whether the attacker has unlimited time to carry out their actions or if they need to act quickly, which can influence the type and complexity of attacks they can mount."
Explain the 'Unbypassable' principle in TCB design.,"The **Unbypassable** principle, also known as completeness, in **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** design dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations and data paths must be routed through the TCB, ensuring that an attacker cannot circumvent the trusted components to compromise the system's security properties."
Describe the 'Tamper-resistant' principle for TCB design.,"The **Tamper-resistant** principle, also referred to as security, in **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** design states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. This means that external components, which are not part of the trusted base, cannot modify the TCB's code or state. This protection is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the TCB's security functions."
What does the 'Verifiable' principle imply for TCB design?,"The **Verifiable** principle, also known as correctness, in **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** design implies that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This means that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis, testing, and formal methods to demonstrate that it behaves as expected and correctly enforces its security policies, thereby ensuring its trustworthiness."
What is the relationship between the size of the TCB and its trustworthiness and verifiability?,"A system with a **smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is generally considered **more trustworthy and easier to verify**. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions to be made about its components, and there is less code or hardware to scrutinize for potential vulnerabilities. This concept aligns with the **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle**, advocating for simplicity to reduce complexity and potential errors in security-critical components."
What are the challenges associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"Designing a secure system with a **smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is more challenging because it necessitates considering a greater number of malicious entities. When the TCB is smaller, more components fall outside its trusted boundary, meaning the security solution must account for potential threats and misbehavior from a wider range of external elements. This increases the complexity of threat modeling and designing robust protections."
How do external parties contribute to insecurity?,"External parties contribute to insecurity primarily through the manipulation of an individual's trust for profit. A prime example of this is **social engineering**, where attackers exploit human psychology and trust to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security."
What is the role of 'Physical security' in computer systems?,"**Physical security** in computer systems refers to the measures taken to protect the physical hardware and infrastructure from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. It is a foundational security requirement across various system types, from standalone monoprogram computers to networked systems, ensuring the integrity and availability of the computing environment."
Define 'Process protection' and explain when it becomes necessary.,"**Process protection** refers to security mechanisms designed to isolate and safeguard individual processes (running programs) from interfering with each other or with the operating system itself. It becomes necessary when a computer system runs multiple programs concurrently, such as in a **standalone computer single user multiprogram** environment or more complex systems, to prevent one program's malfunction or malicious intent from affecting others or the system's stability."
What is 'Data protection' and in which system configurations is it required?,"**Data protection** involves measures to prevent unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, or destruction of data. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. According to the document, data protection is required in system configurations where multiple users or networked access is involved, specifically for a **standalone computer multiple user** system and a **networked computer** system, to manage and secure distinct user data and data in transit."
Explain the concept of 'User authentication' and its necessity.,"**User authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a computer system or network. It typically involves requiring credentials such as usernames and passwords, biometrics, or security tokens. User authentication becomes necessary in systems where multiple users can access the resources, such as a **standalone computer multiple user** system and a **networked computer**, to ensure that only authorized individuals can gain entry and access their respective data and functionalities."
What is 'Communication protection' and why is it essential for networked computers?,"**Communication protection** refers to the security measures applied to data transmitted over a network to safeguard it from unauthorized access, interception, tampering, or disruption during transit. It is essential for **networked computers** because, unlike standalone systems, they exchange information across potentially insecure networks. This protection ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data as it moves between connected systems, preventing external threats from compromising network communications."
How does system complexity relate to insecurity?,"**System complexity leads to insecurity** because as systems become more intricate, with more users, programs, and network connections, the number of potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces increases. Each added layer of functionality or connectivity introduces new challenges in providing a protected environment for data and its processing, requiring a broader and deeper set of security measures to maintain integrity and confidentiality."
What are the two main expectations of an entity's behavior when defining 'Trust'?,"When defining 'Trust' in a cyber system, the two main expectations of an entity's behavior are: \n\n1.  **What the entity is expected to do**: This includes positive actions like an anti-malware program detecting malicious programs or a system preventing illegal account logins. \n2.  **What the entity is expected not to do**: This includes refraining from negative actions, such as a website not exposing private data to third parties or an application not injecting viruses into the system."
What is the KISS principle and how does it apply to TCB size?,"The **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle** is an acronym that advocates for simplicity in design. It applies to **Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size** by suggesting that a system with a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a simpler, smaller TCB reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made about its components, making it less likely for those assumptions to be violated and easier to rigorously check for correctness."
What are the general categories of factors that lead to insecurity?,"The document identifies two general categories of factors that lead to insecurity: \n\n1.  **System Complexity**: As systems become more complex (e.g., from monoprogram to multiprogram, single user to multiple user, standalone to networked), the number of required security protections increases, and managing this complexity can introduce vulnerabilities. \n2.  **Human Factors**: These involve the actions and behaviors of individuals, including System Users (e.g., misconfiguration, prioritizing convenience), System Developers (e.g., incorrect design/implementation, human error), and External Parties (e.g., social engineering)."
How does misconfiguration by system users lead to insecurity?,"Misconfiguration by **System Users** leads to insecurity because security features are not used correctly. When security settings are improperly set up or left at default, they can create unintended vulnerabilities or leave parts of the system exposed, even if the underlying security mechanisms are robust. This effectively bypasses the intended protection provided by the security features."
What is the role of 'Attacker's assumption' in a Threat Model?,"The **Attacker's assumption** in a **Threat Model** defines the characteristics, knowledge, and capabilities of the potential adversaries. It specifies the type of attacker (active or passive), their level of knowledge about the system (e.g., detailed design knowledge or reliance on trial and error), and their capabilities (e.g., computing resources, system interaction points, time constraints). This helps in understanding the potential threats and designing appropriate defenses."
What are the two types of attackers based on their actions?,"Based on their actions, the two types of attackers are: \n\n1.  **Active attacker**: This type of attacker aims to manipulate or disrupt systems. Their actions include modifying data or injecting code, directly interfering with the system's operation. \n2.  **Passive attacker**: This type of attacker focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system. They aim to collect data without altering the system's state."
How does an attacker's lack of detailed knowledge impact their approach?,"An attacker's lack of detailed knowledge about a system's design, architecture, or source code significantly impacts their approach by forcing them to **rely on probing or trial and error**. Instead of exploiting known vulnerabilities or design flaws, they must actively explore the system, test various inputs, and observe responses to discover potential weaknesses or gain information, making their attacks potentially less efficient or more detectable."
What are the two main considerations when designing a security solution regarding the TCB?,"When designing a security solution, two main considerations regarding the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** are: \n\n1.  **Assume TCB components are secure**: All components inside the TCB must be assumed to be secure, but this assumption must be supported with valid justifications. \n2.  **Prevent damages from outside TCB**: Measures must be put in place to prevent any damages from components that are outside of the TCB, as these are considered potentially malicious or untrusted."
How does the concept of 'security properties' fit into a Threat Model?,"The concept of **security properties** fits into a **Threat Model** by defining **what the system aims to achieve** in terms of security. These properties represent the desired security goals, such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability, that the system is designed to uphold against the identified adversaries and threats. By clearly stating these properties, the threat model establishes the objectives for the security design."
What is the role of 'firmware' within the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"**Firmware** is a type of software that provides low-level control for a device's specific hardware. Within the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**, firmware is considered one of the components (along with software, OS, and hardware) that needs to be trusted to ensure the overall security of the cyber system. Its correct and secure operation is critical because it often controls fundamental hardware functions and boot processes, making it a foundational element of trust."
Why is it challenging for developers to design security features correctly?,"It is challenging for developers to design security features correctly because **developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes**. These mistakes can occur during the initial design phase, leading to security features that are not robust or comprehensive enough. Additionally, even if the design is sound, errors can be introduced during the implementation of security components, resulting in vulnerabilities."
How does convenience-seeking behavior by users impact system security?,"Convenience-seeking behavior by **System Users** impacts system security because users may try to disable some security configurations that they find inconvenient. This action, while making the system easier or faster to use for the individual, can inadvertently weaken the overall security posture of the system, creating exploitable vulnerabilities that adversaries can leverage."
What types of components are typically included in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** typically includes a set of essential components that are critical for the security of a cyber system. These components can encompass **software**, the **operating system (OS)**, **firmware**, and **hardware**. All these elements are considered trustworthy and are relied upon to function securely to maintain the overall security of the system."
Explain the concept of 'social engineering' as a threat from external parties.,"**Social engineering** is a threat from **External Parties** where an individual's trust can be manipulated for profit. It involves psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Instead of using technical hacking methods, social engineers exploit human vulnerabilities like trust, curiosity, or fear to gain unauthorized access to systems or data."
What is the primary goal of providing a protected environment for data and its processing?,"The primary goal of providing a protected environment for data and its processing is to mitigate the insecurity that arises from system complexity. As systems become more intricate, they inherently become more vulnerable. Therefore, establishing robust security measures ensures that data remains confidential, its integrity is maintained, and its processing is available only to authorized entities, despite the underlying complexity."
How does a standalone computer with a single user and a monoprogram differ from one with a multiprogram in terms of security needs?,"A **standalone computer single user monoprogram** only requires **Physical security** because it runs a single program and has one user, simplifying its operational environment. **Physical security** protects the hardware. In contrast, a **standalone computer single user multiprogram** requires both **Physical security** and **Process protection**. The addition of **Process protection** is necessary because multiple programs running concurrently introduce the risk of interference or malicious interaction between processes, which needs to be managed to maintain system integrity."
"Why is 'User authentication' not listed as a requirement for a standalone computer with a single user, whether monoprogram or multiprogram?","**User authentication** is not listed as a requirement for a standalone computer with a single user (monoprogram or multiprogram) because the system is designed for and accessed by only one individual. In such a scenario, the primary concern is protecting the physical machine and its processes from external threats or internal program conflicts, rather than differentiating between multiple legitimate users. User authentication becomes critical when multiple distinct users need to access the same system, as seen in 'standalone computer multiple user' and 'networked computer' configurations."
What additional security protection does a networked computer require compared to any standalone computer configuration?,"A **networked computer** requires **Communication protection** in addition to all the security measures found in standalone computer configurations. While standalone systems (even multi-user ones) need physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication, a networked computer's connectivity introduces the need to secure data as it travels across the network, protecting it from interception or tampering during transmission."
What are the consequences if security features are not designed correctly by system developers?,"If security features are not designed correctly by **System Developers**, the consequence is that the system will inherently be insecure or vulnerable from its foundation. Even if implemented perfectly, a flawed design means the security components will not effectively protect the system against threats, potentially leaving critical data or functionalities exposed to attack."
How does the concept of 'Attacker's capability' influence security design?,"The concept of **Attacker's capability** influences security design by informing the strength and type of defenses needed. Understanding how much computing resources an attacker can leverage, what parts of the system they can interact with, and whether they have unlimited time or need to act quickly helps designers anticipate the sophistication and persistence of attacks. This allows for the implementation of countermeasures that are robust enough to withstand the expected capabilities of potential adversaries."
Why is it important for the TCB to be 'Tamper-resistant'?,"It is important for the **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** to be **Tamper-resistant** because the TCB is the core set of components that are assumed to be secure and are relied upon to enforce system security. If parts outside the TCB could modify its code or state, an attacker could compromise the TCB itself, thereby undermining the entire security architecture of the system. Tamper resistance ensures the integrity and reliability of the trusted components."
What is the primary difference in security requirements between a standalone computer with a single user (multiprogram) and a standalone computer with multiple users?,"The primary difference in security requirements between a **standalone computer single user multiprogram** and a **standalone computer multiple user** system lies in the need for **Data protection** and **User authentication**. The single-user multiprogram system requires Physical security and Process protection. However, the multiple-user system, in addition to physical and process protection, mandates **Data protection** to segregate and secure data belonging to different users, and **User authentication** to verify the identity of each user accessing the shared resources."
How does the 'Attacker's knowledge' factor into a threat model?,"The **Attacker's knowledge** factor in a threat model helps to assess the sophistication and potential vectors of attack. It considers whether an attacker possesses detailed knowledge of the system's design, architecture, and source code, which would enable highly targeted exploits. Alternatively, it considers if the attacker lacks such detailed knowledge and must resort to probing, trial and error, or other discovery methods, which might lead to less efficient or more generalized attacks."
What are the consequences of security components not being implemented correctly by developers?,"The consequences of security components not being implemented correctly by **System Developers** are that even if the design is sound, the actual protective mechanisms will be flawed. This can lead to vulnerabilities, bugs, or loopholes that an attacker can exploit, compromising the system's security. Incorrect implementation essentially renders the intended security features ineffective in practice."
