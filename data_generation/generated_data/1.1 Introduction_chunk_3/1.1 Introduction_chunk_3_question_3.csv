What is the relationship between system complexity and insecurity?,"System complexity directly leads to insecurity. As a system becomes more complex, the number of potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces increases, making it more challenging to provide a protected environment for data and its processing."
What security measures are needed for a standalone computer with a single user and a monoprogram?,"For a standalone computer used by a single user running a monoprogram, the primary security measure required is Physical security. This involves protecting the physical hardware from unauthorized access or damage."
How do security requirements change for a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs?,"For a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs, the security requirements expand to include Physical security and Process protection. Physical security safeguards the hardware, while Process protection ensures that individual programs operate securely and do not interfere with each other or the system's integrity."
What additional security considerations arise for a standalone computer with multiple users?,"A standalone computer with multiple users requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. Data protection ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data, while User authentication verifies the identity of users accessing the system, preventing unauthorized access."
What are the full security requirements for a networked computer?,"A networked computer demands the most comprehensive set of security measures: Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection. Communication protection secures data transmission over the network, safeguarding against eavesdropping or tampering during transit, in addition to the other layers of security."
"Explain the concept of ""Physical security"" in the context of computer systems.","Physical security, in the context of computer systems, refers to the protection of the hardware and infrastructure from physical threats. This includes measures to prevent unauthorized access, theft, damage, or environmental hazards to the computer equipment itself."
"What is ""Process protection"" and when is it required?","Process protection is a security measure that ensures individual programs or processes running on a computer system operate in isolation and do not maliciously or accidentally interfere with other processes or the operating system. It is required in systems that run multiple programs, such as a standalone computer with a single user running multiprograms, or any system with multiple users or network connectivity."
"Define ""Data protection"" and its relevance.","Data protection refers to the measures taken to safeguard data from unauthorized access, corruption, or loss. It is relevant in systems where multiple users might access shared data or where data is sensitive, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For example, it is a requirement for standalone computers with multiple users and networked computers."
"What is ""User authentication"" and why is it important?","User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a computer system or resource. It is important because it ensures that only authorized individuals can gain access, thereby preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data integrity, and enforcing access control policies. It is required in systems with multiple users or network access."
"What does ""Communication protection"" entail for networked systems?","Communication protection for networked systems entails securing the data and control signals exchanged between computers over a network. This involves measures like encryption and secure protocols to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized interception of information during transmission. It is a critical requirement for networked computers due to the inherent risks of data exposure over a network."
How do system users contribute to insecurity?,"System users contribute to insecurity in two primary ways: first, by not using security features correctly, which can manifest as misconfiguration; and second, by prioritizing convenience, leading them to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient."
Provide examples of how system users can cause insecurity.,"System users can cause insecurity through misconfiguration, which means security features are not set up or used properly. Another example is when users, seeking convenience, disable certain security configurations, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities in the system."
In what ways do system developers lead to insecurity?,"System developers lead to insecurity when security features are not designed correctly or when security components are not implemented correctly. Furthermore, developers are human and, like all humans, are prone to making mistakes, which can introduce vulnerabilities into the system."
What role do external parties play in leading to insecurity?,"External parties contribute to insecurity primarily through the manipulation of an individual's trust for profit. This often involves tactics such as social engineering, where individuals are deceived into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security."
What is social engineering?,"Social engineering is a manipulative technique used by external parties to exploit human psychology, often for profit, by tricking individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise the security of a system or organization. It relies on manipulating an individual's trust rather than technical vulnerabilities."
"What are the main components of the ""Basics of Cyber Security"" according to the document?","The main components of the ""Basics of Cyber Security"" include the Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security."
What is a Threat Model in cyber security?,"A Threat Model in cyber security is a structured approach used to describe the adversaries and threats that a system might face. It considers what is trusted and not trusted within the system, the resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities, and the security properties the system aims to achieve."
What are the key elements considered within a Threat Model?,"The key elements considered within a Threat Model are the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), Attacker's assumption, and Security properties. It also describes what is trusted and not trusted, the resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities, and the actions they can perform, along with the security properties the system aims to achieve."
"Explain the concept of ""Trusted Computing Base (TCB)"" as part of a Threat Model.","The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is a fundamental concept within a Threat Model, representing a set of components (e.g., software, OS, firmware, hardware) that are assumed to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. The Threat Model defines what is included in this trusted base and, by extension, what is not trusted."
"What are ""Attacker's assumptions"" in a Threat Model?","Attacker's assumptions in a Threat Model describe the characteristics of potential adversaries, including their type (active or passive), their knowledge (e.g., system design, source code, or lack thereof), and their capabilities (e.g., computing resources, interaction points, time constraints). These assumptions help in understanding the potential threats and designing appropriate defenses."
"What are ""Security properties"" in the context of a Threat Model?","Security properties, in the context of a Threat Model, are the specific security goals or attributes that the system aims to achieve. These properties define what a secure system should uphold, such as confidentiality, integrity, or availability, and are used to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures against identified threats."
"What is ""Trust"" in the context of cyber systems?","In the context of cyber systems, ""Trust"" refers to the degree to which an entity is expected to behave in a predictable and secure manner. This expectation includes both what the entity is anticipated to do and what it is anticipated not to do."
"What does it mean for an entity to be ""expected to do"" something in terms of trust? Provide examples.","For an entity to be ""expected to do"" something in terms of trust means that it is relied upon to perform specific security-related functions. Examples include anti-malware software being expected to detect malicious programs, and a system being expected to prevent illegal account logins."
"What does it mean for an entity to be ""expected not to do"" something in terms of trust? Provide examples.","For an entity to be ""expected not to do"" something in terms of trust means that it is relied upon to refrain from certain actions that would compromise security. Examples include a website being expected not to expose private data to third parties, and an application being expected not to inject a virus into the system."
Why is it crucial to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is crucial to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities are trusted. Without clear definitions of trust, the designed security solutions may fail in practice, as assumptions about entity behavior could be violated."
What is the definition of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, which can include software, operating systems (OS), firmware, and hardware, that must be trusted to ensure the overall security of a cyber system."
What types of components can be part of the TCB?,"Components that can be part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) include software, the operating system (OS), firmware, and hardware. These are the elements that are assumed to be secure and reliable for the system's overall security."
What is the implication of components being outside the TCB?,"The implication of components being outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that they can be malicious and misbehave. Therefore, security solutions must be designed to prevent any damages that could arise from these untrusted external components."
What are the two main considerations when designing a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution concerning the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), the two main considerations are: first, to assume all components inside the TCB are secure with valid justifications; and second, to prevent any damages from components outside of the TCB."
"Describe the ""Unbypassable"" design principle for TCB.","The ""Unbypassable"" design principle for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also known as completeness, dictates that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means all security-critical operations must pass through and be enforced by the TCB."
"Explain the ""Tamper-resistant"" design principle for TCB.","The ""Tamper-resistant"" design principle for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also known as security, states that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or its state, ensuring its integrity and reliability."
"What is the ""Verifiable"" design principle for TCB?","The ""Verifiable"" design principle for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), also known as correctness, requires that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation can be rigorously checked to ensure it functions as intended and meets its security objectives."
How does the size of the TCB affect trustworthiness and verification?,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify. This is because a smaller TCB requires fewer assumptions, which are less likely to be violated, simplifying the process of ensuring its correctness and security."
"What is the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle and how does it relate to TCB size?","The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle advocates for simplicity in design to reduce complexity and potential errors. It relates to TCB size by suggesting that a smaller Trusted Computing Base is more trustworthy and easier to verify, as it aligns with the idea that simpler systems are inherently more secure and manageable."
What are the challenges associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is more challenging because it requires considering a greater number of malicious entities outside the TCB. This means the smaller, trusted core must be robust enough to defend against a wider range of potential threats from the larger, untrusted environment."
What are the two main types of attackers based on their actions?,"Based on their actions, the two main types of attackers are Active attackers and Passive attackers."
"Define an ""Active"" attacker.","An ""Active"" attacker is a type of adversary who manipulates or disrupts systems. This can involve actions such as modifying data or injecting code into a system, directly interfering with its operation or integrity."
"Define a ""Passive"" attacker.","A ""Passive"" attacker is a type of adversary who observes and gathers information without interfering with the system. Their actions are limited to monitoring communications or data without making any modifications."
What are the different aspects of an attacker's knowledge considered in security?,"An attacker's knowledge can vary. It can include knowing the system's design, architecture, and source code. Alternatively, an attacker might lack detailed knowledge and, in such cases, must rely on probing or trial and error to gain information or exploit vulnerabilities."
How does an attacker's lack of detailed knowledge influence their methods?,"When an attacker lacks detailed knowledge of a system's design, architecture, or source code, their methods are influenced by this limitation. They must then rely on less direct approaches such as probing the system for information or using trial and error to discover vulnerabilities or gain access."
What factors are considered regarding an attacker's capability?,"Regarding an attacker's capability, several factors are considered: how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, and whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly."
How does system complexity influence the security requirements for a computer system?,"System complexity directly influences security requirements by increasing them. As a system becomes more complex, for example, by supporting multiple users, multiprograms, or network connectivity, additional layers of security such as process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection become necessary to maintain a protected environment."
What is the primary goal when providing a protected environment for data and processing?,"The primary goal when providing a protected environment for data and processing is to ensure the security of the system, safeguarding information and operations from unauthorized access, modification, or disruption, especially as system complexity increases."
What are the general categories of factors that lead to insecurity?,"The general categories of factors that lead to insecurity are System Complexity and Human Factors. System complexity introduces more vulnerabilities, while human factors, involving users, developers, and external parties, introduce errors, misconfigurations, and manipulative threats."
"What are the three main areas of focus in the ""Basics of Cyber Security""?","The three main areas of focus in the ""Basics of Cyber Security"" are the Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security."
Why is trust fundamental to establishing security in a cyber system?,"Trust is fundamental to establishing security in a cyber system because security cannot be achieved if no entities are trusted. Clearly defining what should be trusted, including what entities are expected to do and not to do, is essential; otherwise, designed security solutions may fail in practice."
"What is the relationship between Attackers' assumptions, the Computer System, and Security Properties in a Threat Model?","In a Threat Model, Attackers' assumptions define the characteristics and capabilities of potential adversaries. These assumptions are then used to analyze the Computer System, specifically considering its Trusted Computing Base (TCB), to determine how it might be attacked. The goal is to ensure the system can uphold its defined Security Properties despite these assumed threats."
What are the specific security requirements for a standalone computer with multiple users?,"For a standalone computer with multiple users, the specific security requirements include Physical security to protect the hardware, Process protection to isolate running programs, Data protection to secure user data, and User authentication to verify user identities and control access."
"How do security features being ""not used correctly"" by users contribute to insecurity?","Security features being ""not used correctly"" by users contributes to insecurity through misconfiguration. This means that even if robust security mechanisms are in place, their improper setup or application by users can leave the system vulnerable to attacks, effectively negating the intended protection."
What is the overall purpose of defining a Threat Model?,"The overall purpose of defining a Threat Model is to systematically describe the adversaries and threats under consideration for a cyber system. This involves identifying trusted and untrusted components (TCB), understanding attacker capabilities and knowledge, and specifying the security properties the system aims to achieve, thereby guiding the design of effective security solutions."
