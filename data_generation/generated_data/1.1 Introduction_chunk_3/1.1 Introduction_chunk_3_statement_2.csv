Define the concept of how system complexity leads to insecurity.,"System complexity leads to insecurity by increasing the number of components and interactions that need to be secured. As systems become more complex, the number of potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces grows, making it harder to provide a protected environment for data and their processing. This is evident in the varying security requirements for different computer configurations, where more complex systems (e.g., networked, multi-user, multiprogram) require additional layers of protection beyond basic physical security."
Explain the primary security measure for a standalone computer with a single user running a monoprogram.,"A standalone computer with a single user and a monoprogram primarily relies on Physical security. Physical security refers to measures taken to protect the physical components of the computer system from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. This includes controlling access to the physical location of the computer and protecting its hardware."
"What additional security measures are necessary for a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs, beyond what is needed for a monoprogram system?","For a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs (multiprogram), in addition to Physical security, Process protection is required. Physical security involves safeguarding the physical components of the system. Process protection refers to mechanisms that ensure that different programs or processes running concurrently on the system do not interfere with each other or access each other's resources without authorization, thereby preventing one program from compromising the integrity or confidentiality of another."
Describe the complete set of security requirements for a standalone computer used by multiple users.,"A standalone computer used by multiple users requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication.
*   Physical security protects the hardware from unauthorized access.
*   Process protection ensures that different programs or processes do not interfere with each other.
*   Data protection involves safeguarding data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like passwords, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the system."
List all the security measures required for a networked computer.,"A networked computer requires comprehensive security measures including Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection.
*   Physical security protects the hardware.
*   Process protection isolates running programs.
*   Data protection safeguards data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   User authentication verifies user identities.
*   Communication protection secures data transmitted over networks, ensuring its confidentiality and integrity during transit, often through encryption and secure protocols."
How do human factors contribute to insecurity from the perspective of system users?,"From the perspective of System Users, human factors lead to insecurity primarily through two mechanisms:
1.  Misconfiguration: Security features are not used correctly, e.g., misconfiguration.
2.  Convenience over security: Users like convenience and may try to disable some security configurations that are not inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses."
Explain how system developers can introduce insecurity into a system.,"System Developers can introduce insecurity in several ways:
1.  Incorrect design: Security features are not designed correctly.
2.  Incorrect implementation: Security components are not implemented correctly.
3.  Human error: Developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes during the design and implementation phases, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities."
What role do external parties play in leading to insecurity?,"External Parties contribute to insecurity when an individual's trust can be manipulated for profit. A prime example of this is social engineering, which involves psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, often bypassing technical security measures."
"What are the three main components of the ""Threat Model"" in cyber security?","The three main components of the ""Threat Model"" in cyber security are the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), Attacker's assumption, and Security properties. These elements collectively describe the adversaries and threats under consideration, what is trusted and not trusted, and what the system aims to achieve securely."
"Define ""Threat Model"" in the context of cyber security.","A Threat Model in cyber security is a structured approach used to describe the adversaries and threats under consideration for a system. It involves identifying what components are trusted and not trusted (the Trusted Computing Base or TCB), understanding the resources, capabilities, and knowledge of untrusted entities, and specifying what security properties the system aims to achieve."
What aspects of untrusted entities must be considered when developing a threat model?,"When developing a threat model, for the untrusted entities, it is crucial to consider:
1.  What resources, capabilities, and knowledge they have.
2.  What actions they can perform."
"What is the definition of ""Trust"" in a cyber system?","Trust in a cyber system is defined as the degree to which an entity is expected to behave. This expectation encompasses both what the entity is anticipated to do (e.g., anti-malware can detect malicious programs, system can prevent illegal account login) and what the entity is expected not to do (e.g., the website will not expose your private data to third parties, an application will not inject virus into your system)."
Why is it important to clearly define what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established in a cyber system if no entities are trusted. Otherwise, the designed security solutions may fail in practice, as assumptions about entity behavior could be violated, leading to vulnerabilities."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected to do"" in terms of trust.","In terms of trust, an entity is ""expected to do"" actions that contribute to the system's security and functionality. Examples include:
*   Anti-malware can detect malicious programs.
*   A system can prevent illegal account login, etc."
"Provide examples of what an entity is ""expected not to do"" in terms of trust.","In terms of trust, an entity is ""expected not to do"" actions that would compromise the system's security or user privacy. Examples include:
*   The website will not expose your private data to third parties.
*   An application will not inject virus into your system."
Define the Trusted Computing Base (TCB).,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components (e.g., software, OS, firmware, hardware) that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. These are the core components whose correct functioning is assumed for the overall security of the system."
What is the implication of components being outside the TCB?,The implication of components being outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that they can be malicious and misbehave. This means that security solutions must be designed to account for the potential untrustworthiness of these external components and prevent them from compromising the system.
What are the two main considerations when designing a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution, two main considerations regarding the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are:
1.  Assume all the components inside the TCB are secure with valid justifications.
2.  Prevent any damages from any components outside of the TCB."
"Describe the ""Unbypassable"" principle in TCB design.","The ""Unbypassable"" principle, also referred to as completeness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design states that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This means that all security-critical operations must pass through and be enforced by the TCB, ensuring that its security mechanisms cannot be circumvented."
"Explain the ""Tamper-resistant"" principle for TCB design.","The ""Tamper-resistant"" principle, also known as security, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design dictates that the TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state, thereby preserving the integrity and reliability of the trusted components."
"What does the ""Verifiable"" principle mean in the context of TCB design?","The ""Verifiable"" principle, also known as correctness, in Trusted Computing Base (TCB) design means that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB. This implies that the TCB's design and implementation should be amenable to rigorous analysis and proof to ensure it behaves as expected and correctly enforces security policies."
What is the advantage of having a smaller TCB?,"The advantage of having a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that a system with a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify (we do not need to make too many assumptions, which may be violated). This follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle."
What is the challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"The challenge associated with designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is that it is more challenging (we need to consider more malicious entities). This is because with a smaller TCB, designers need to account for more potentially untrusted components outside the trusted boundary."
"Differentiate between an ""Active"" and a ""Passive"" attacker.","An Active attacker is one who manipulates or disrupts the systems, e.g., modifying data, injecting code. In contrast, a Passive attacker observes and gathers information without interfering with the system. The key difference lies in the interaction with the system: active attackers modify, while passive attackers only monitor."
What types of knowledge might an attacker possess?,"An attacker might possess various types of knowledge, including:
*   Knowing the system's design, architecture, source code, etc.
*   Alternatively, lacking detailed knowledge and must rely on probing or trial and error to discover vulnerabilities."
What factors define an attacker's capability?,"An attacker's capability is defined by several factors:
*   How much computing resources the attacker can leverage.
*   What parts of the system the attacker can interact with.
*   Whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly."
"How does ""Physical security"" contribute to protecting a computer system?","Physical security contributes to protecting a computer system by safeguarding its physical components from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. This involves measures like securing the physical location of the hardware, controlling entry points, and protecting against environmental threats, forming the foundational layer of security for any system."
"Explain the concept of ""Process protection"" in computer security.","Process protection in computer security refers to the mechanisms that ensure that different programs or processes running concurrently on a system do not interfere with each other or access each other's resources without authorization. This prevents one process from compromising the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of another, or the system as a whole."
"What is the purpose of ""Data protection""?","The purpose of Data protection is to safeguard data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. This ensures the confidentiality (preventing unauthorized disclosure), integrity (maintaining accuracy and completeness), and availability (ensuring data is accessible when needed) of information, regardless of whether it is at rest, in use, or in transit."
"Describe ""User authentication"" and its importance.","User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials such as usernames and passwords, biometric data, or multi-factor methods. Its importance lies in ensuring that only authorized individuals can access a system or its resources, thereby preventing unauthorized access and maintaining system security."
"What does ""Communication protection"" entail for a networked computer?","For a networked computer, Communication protection entails securing data transmitted over networks. This involves measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information during transit, often through the use of encryption, secure protocols, and other network security mechanisms to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized interception of data."
How does misconfiguration by system users lead to insecurity?,"Misconfiguration by system users leads to insecurity because security features, even if present, are not used correctly. This can result in unintended vulnerabilities or open doors for attackers, as the intended protective mechanisms are either bypassed, weakened, or entirely ineffective due to incorrect setup or settings."
"Why might users disable security configurations, and what is the consequence?","Users might disable security configurations because they like convenience and may try to disable some security configurations that are not inconvenient. The consequence is a reduction in the system's overall security posture, as these disabled configurations leave the system more vulnerable to attacks, potentially exposing data or allowing unauthorized access."
"What are ""Security properties"" in the context of a Threat Model?","Security properties in the context of a Threat Model refer to what security properties the system aims to achieve. These properties typically include confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and they define what ""secure"" means for that particular system against the identified threats and adversaries."
How does the diagram on page 4 illustrate the components of a Threat Model?,"The diagram on page 4 illustrates the components of a Threat Model by showing the Computer System at its center. It highlights Attackers' assumptions as external factors influencing the system, and the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) as a critical, trusted part within or interacting with the system. Finally, Security Properties are shown as the desired outcomes or goals that the system aims to achieve in the face of these assumptions and the TCB's role."
"What is the KISS principle, and how does it relate to TCB size?","The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is a design philosophy that advocates for simplicity in design. It relates to Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size by suggesting that a system with a smaller TCB is more trustworthy and easier to verify (we do not need to make too many assumptions, which may be violated). A simpler, smaller TCB reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made, which in turn reduces the chances of those assumptions being violated, thus enhancing security."
How can developers' mistakes lead to insecurity?,"Developers' mistakes can lead to insecurity because developers are humans, and humans can make mistakes during the design and implementation of security features and components. These errors can introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or logical flaws that attackers can exploit, compromising the system's security."
"What is social engineering, and why is it a human factor leading to insecurity?","Social engineering is a manipulation technique where an individual's trust can be manipulated for profit. It is a human factor leading to insecurity because it leverages human psychology to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, often bypassing technical security measures by exploiting human vulnerabilities rather than system flaws."
"What are the ""Basics of Cyber Security"" as outlined in the document?","The ""Basics of Cyber Security"" as outlined in the document encompass three main areas: Threat Model, Security Strategies, and Design Principles of Computer Security. These foundational concepts provide a framework for understanding and addressing security challenges in cyber systems."
Why is it crucial to assume TCB components are secure with valid justifications?,"It is crucial to assume Trusted Computing Base (TCB) components are secure with valid justifications because the TCB forms the foundation of trust for the entire cyber system. Without a strong, justified assumption of its security, the integrity of any security solution built upon it would be compromised, as the core trusted elements could themselves be vulnerable."
"How does the concept of ""Trust"" relate to the overall security of a cyber system?","The concept of ""Trust"" is fundamental to the overall security of a cyber system because security cannot be established in a cyber system if no entities are trusted. Clear definitions of what an entity is expected to do and not to do are essential. If these trust boundaries are ambiguous or violated, even well-designed security solutions may fail in practice, leading to system vulnerabilities."
What is the primary goal when providing a protected environment for data and its processing?,"The primary goal when providing a protected environment for data and its processing is to ensure the security of the system against various threats. This involves implementing appropriate security measures, such as physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection, tailored to the complexity and nature of the computer system."
How does a standalone computer with multiple users differ in security needs from one with a single user and multiprograms?,"A standalone computer with multiple users requires additional security measures compared to one with a single user and multiprograms. While both need Physical security and Process protection, the multiple-user system additionally requires Data protection and User authentication. Data protection safeguards individual user data, and user authentication verifies each user's identity to control access."
What are the potential consequences if security features are not designed correctly by system developers?,"If security features are not designed correctly by system developers, the potential consequences are significant insecurity. This can lead to fundamental flaws in the system's defenses, making it vulnerable to attacks even before implementation. Such design flaws can be difficult and costly to rectify later, potentially compromising data, system integrity, and user privacy."
"In the context of attacker's knowledge, what does it mean to ""lack detailed knowledge""?","In the context of attacker's knowledge, to ""lack detailed knowledge"" means that the attacker does not possess comprehensive information about the system's design, architecture, or source code. Instead, such an attacker must rely on methods like probing or trial and error to discover vulnerabilities and gain access."
How do time constraints affect an attacker's capability?,"Time constraints significantly affect an attacker's capability. If an attacker has unlimited time, they can conduct more thorough reconnaissance, brute-force attacks, or complex multi-stage exploits. Conversely, if an attacker needs to act quickly, their options are limited to faster, potentially less sophisticated attacks, or they might be forced to abandon an attack if it takes too long."
What is the relationship between system complexity and the types of security measures required?,"There is a direct relationship between system complexity and the types of security measures required: as system complexity increases, more layers and types of security measures become necessary. For instance, a simple monoprogram standalone computer only needs physical security, whereas a networked, multi-user system demands physical, process, data, user authentication, and communication protection. This escalation in requirements reflects the increased attack surface and potential vulnerabilities introduced by complexity."
Why is it important to prevent damages from components outside the TCB?,"It is important to prevent damages from components outside the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) because these components are explicitly considered potentially malicious and capable of misbehaving. Failing to prevent damage from them would undermine the entire security posture of the system, as untrusted elements could compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system and its data."
"How does the concept of ""Attacker's assumption"" inform the Threat Model?","The concept of ""Attacker's assumption"" informs the Threat Model by detailing the characteristics of the potential adversaries. This includes understanding the type of attacker (active or passive), their knowledge (e.g., detailed system knowledge or reliance on probing), and their capabilities (e.g., computing resources, interaction points, time constraints). By making these assumptions explicit, the Threat Model can accurately define the scope and nature of threats the system must defend against."
What are the three core design principles for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The three core design principles for the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are:
1.  Unbypassable (completeness): There must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB.
2.  Tamper-resistant (security): TCB should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These parts cannot modify the TCB's code or state.
3.  Verifiable (correctness): It should be possible to verify the correctness of TCB."
