Compare the security requirements for a 'Standalone computer single user monoprogram' with a 'Standalone computer single user multiprogram'.,"A 'Standalone computer single user monoprogram' requires Physical security. Physical security refers to measures protecting the physical hardware from unauthorized access or damage. In contrast, a 'Standalone computer single user multiprogram' requires both Physical security and Process protection. Process protection involves mechanisms to isolate and protect individual processes running on the system from interfering with each other or the operating system, ensuring that one program's malfunction does not compromise the entire system."
What are the differences in security requirements between a 'Standalone computer single user multiprogram' and a 'Standalone computer multiple user' system?,"A 'Standalone computer single user multiprogram' requires Physical security and Process protection. Physical security protects the physical hardware, while Process protection isolates running programs. A 'Standalone computer multiple user' system, however, requires additional protections: Data protection and User authentication. Data protection ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, preventing unauthorized access or modification. User authentication verifies the identity of users attempting to access the system, ensuring only authorized individuals can log in."
Compare the security needs of a 'Standalone computer multiple user' system with a 'Networked computer'.,"A 'Standalone computer multiple user' system requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. A 'Networked computer' requires all of these, plus an additional layer of security: Communication protection. Communication protection involves securing data transmissions over a network, safeguarding against eavesdropping, tampering, or unauthorized access during communication between systems or users."
What are the key differences in security requirements between a 'Standalone computer single user monoprogram' and a 'Standalone computer multiple user' system?,"A 'Standalone computer single user monoprogram' primarily requires Physical security, which protects the hardware. A 'Standalone computer multiple user' system, being more complex, requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. Process protection isolates running programs, Data protection secures information, and User authentication verifies user identities, all of which are necessary when multiple users share a system and its resources."
Compare the security requirements for a 'Standalone computer single user monoprogram' with a 'Networked computer'.,"A 'Standalone computer single user monoprogram' requires only Physical security, which protects the physical hardware. A 'Networked computer', being the most complex system described, requires a comprehensive set of protections: Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection. This includes protecting the physical hardware, isolating processes, securing data, verifying user identities, and safeguarding network communications."
How do the security requirements for a 'Standalone computer single user multiprogram' differ from those of a 'Networked computer'?,"A 'Standalone computer single user multiprogram' requires Physical security and Process protection. Physical security protects the hardware, and Process protection isolates running programs. A 'Networked computer' requires these two, plus Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection. Data protection secures information, User authentication verifies user identities, and Communication protection safeguards data transmissions over the network, addressing the added complexities and risks of a networked environment."
What additional security protections are required for a standalone computer with multiple users compared to a single-user multiprogram system?,"Compared to a standalone computer with a single user running multiple programs, which requires Physical security and Process protection, a standalone computer with multiple users additionally requires Data protection and User authentication. Data protection ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, preventing unauthorized access or modification by different users. User authentication verifies the identity of each user, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the system and their respective data."
How do the security requirements for a networked computer differ from those of a standalone computer with multiple users?,"A standalone computer with multiple users requires Physical security, Process protection, Data protection, and User authentication. A networked computer requires all of these, plus Communication protection. Communication protection is essential for networked systems to secure data transmissions over the network, protecting against threats like eavesdropping or tampering that are inherent in a distributed environment."
What is the primary difference in security needs between a single-user monoprogram system and any other more complex system described?,"The primary difference is that a single-user monoprogram system only requires Physical security, which protects the physical hardware. All other more complex systems (single user multiprogram, multiple user, networked) require additional layers of security beyond just physical protection, such as Process protection, Data protection, User authentication, and Communication protection, to address the increased complexity and potential attack surfaces introduced by multiple programs, multiple users, or network connectivity."
Compare the security implications of adding 'Process protection' to a system.,"Adding Process protection to a system, such as moving from a single-user monoprogram to a single-user multiprogram environment, significantly enhances security by isolating individual processes. This means that if one program malfunctions or is compromised, it is prevented from interfering with other running programs or the operating system itself. This isolation helps maintain system stability and prevents a single application vulnerability from leading to a complete system compromise."
Compare the security implications of adding 'Data protection' to a system.,"Adding Data protection to a system, as seen when moving from a single-user multiprogram to a multiple-user environment, introduces mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This is crucial in multi-user systems to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of information by different users. It implies controls like access permissions, encryption, and backup strategies to safeguard sensitive data."
Compare the security implications of adding 'User authentication' to a system.,"Adding User authentication to a system, which becomes necessary in multiple-user and networked environments, means implementing mechanisms to verify the identity of individuals attempting to access the system. This is a fundamental security control that ensures only authorized users can log in and interact with the system's resources. It helps prevent unauthorized access and provides accountability for actions performed within the system."
Compare the security implications of adding 'Communication protection' to a system.,"Adding Communication protection, which is a requirement for networked computers, addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in data transmission over a network. This involves securing the communication channels to prevent unauthorized interception, modification, or injection of data during transit. It safeguards against threats like eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data tampering, ensuring the privacy and integrity of information exchanged between networked entities."
What security protections are common across all types of computer systems depicted?,"Across all types of computer systems depicted – standalone single user monoprogram, standalone single user multiprogram, standalone multiple user, and networked computer – Physical security is a common and fundamental requirement. Physical security refers to measures taken to protect the physical hardware components of a computer system from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or environmental hazards."
How does the introduction of multiple users impact the security requirements of a standalone computer?,"The introduction of multiple users to a standalone computer significantly expands its security requirements. While a single-user multiprogram system needs Physical security and Process protection, a multiple-user system additionally requires Data protection and User authentication. Data protection becomes essential to manage and secure individual user data and shared resources, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. User authentication is crucial to verify the identity of each user, granting appropriate access and maintaining accountability within the shared environment."
Compare how System Users and System Developers contribute to system insecurity.,"System Users contribute to insecurity primarily through incorrect usage of security features, such as misconfiguration. They may also prioritize convenience, leading them to disable security configurations that they perceive as inconvenient. System Developers, on the other hand, contribute to insecurity when security features are not designed correctly or security components are not implemented correctly. Furthermore, as humans, developers are prone to making mistakes during the design and implementation processes, which can introduce vulnerabilities."
What are the differences in how System Users and External Parties lead to insecurity?,"System Users lead to insecurity through internal actions like misconfiguration or intentionally disabling security features for convenience. Their actions are typically within the system's operational context. External Parties, however, lead to insecurity by manipulating an individual's trust for profit, a practice known as social engineering. This involves external influence and deception to gain unauthorized access or information, rather than direct interaction with system configurations by an authorized user."
Compare the ways System Developers and External Parties can introduce insecurity into a system.,"System Developers introduce insecurity through flaws in the system's creation: security features may not be designed correctly, or security components may not be implemented correctly due to human error. This results in inherent vulnerabilities within the system's code or architecture. External Parties introduce insecurity by manipulating human trust, often through social engineering, to exploit individuals rather than directly exploiting technical flaws in the system's design or implementation. Their methods target human psychology to bypass security measures."
How do misconfiguration by System Users and incorrect design by System Developers both lead to insecurity?,"Both misconfiguration by System Users and incorrect design by System Developers lead to insecurity by creating vulnerabilities or weakening existing security postures. Misconfiguration by System Users means that even if security features are well-designed, they are not applied or set up correctly, leaving gaps. Incorrect design by System Developers means that the security features themselves are flawed from the outset, making the system inherently vulnerable regardless of how users configure it. Both scenarios result in a system that is not adequately protected."
What is the distinction between human error by developers and manipulation of trust by external parties in causing insecurity?,"Human error by developers refers to mistakes made during the design or implementation of security features, leading to technical vulnerabilities within the system itself. This is an internal flaw in the system's construction. Manipulation of trust by external parties, often through social engineering, involves exploiting human psychology and trust to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. This is an external attack vector that targets human behavior rather than technical system flaws."
Compare the motivations behind security failures caused by System Users versus those caused by External Parties.,"Security failures caused by System Users are often motivated by convenience, where users may disable security configurations if they perceive them as inconvenient, or by a lack of understanding leading to misconfiguration. Their intent is usually not malicious but rather to simplify their interaction with the system. Security failures caused by External Parties are motivated by profit, achieved through manipulating an individual's trust, such as via social engineering. Their intent is explicitly malicious, aiming to gain unauthorized access or information for personal gain."
What are the key components described in a Threat Model?,"A Threat Model describes the adversaries and threats under consideration by detailing three key components: what is trusted and what is not trusted, referred to as the Trusted Computing Base (TCB); for the untrusted entities, what resources, capabilities, and knowledge they possess and what actions they can perform; and what security properties the system aims to achieve. These elements collectively define the security landscape and objectives for a given system."
Compare the role of 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' with 'Attacker's assumption' within a Threat Model.,"Within a Threat Model, the 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' defines the components of the system (software, OS, firmware, hardware) that are assumed to be secure and reliable. It delineates what parts of the system are implicitly trusted. 'Attacker's assumption', on the other hand, describes the characteristics of potential adversaries, including their type (active or passive), knowledge (e.g., system design or lack thereof), and capabilities (e.g., computing resources, interaction points, time constraints). While TCB defines the secure core of the system, Attacker's assumption defines the nature of the threats against it."
How do 'Attacker's assumptions' and 'Security properties' relate within the context of a Threat Model?,"Within a Threat Model, 'Attacker's assumptions' define the characteristics of the adversaries, including their type, knowledge, and capabilities. This understanding of potential threats informs the 'Security properties' that the system aims to achieve. Security properties are the specific goals or attributes that the system must maintain to be considered secure against the identified attackers. For example, if an attacker is assumed to have certain capabilities, the system's security properties would include measures to counteract those capabilities, ensuring the system's resilience against such threats."
What is the difference between what is 'trusted' and what is 'not trusted' in a Threat Model?,"In a Threat Model, what is 'trusted' refers to the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), which is a set of components (e.g., software, OS, firmware, hardware) that are assumed to be secure and reliable and are essential for ensuring the overall security of the cyber system. Conversely, what is 'not trusted' refers to entities or components outside the TCB. These untrusted entities are considered potential adversaries, and their resources, capabilities, knowledge, and potential actions are analyzed to understand the threats they pose to the system."
Compare the information considered about 'untrusted entities' with the 'security properties' a system aims to achieve in a Threat Model.,"In a Threat Model, information considered about 'untrusted entities' includes their resources, capabilities, knowledge, and the actions they can perform. This detailed understanding of potential adversaries helps to characterize the threats. The 'security properties' a system aims to achieve are the specific goals or attributes that the system must uphold to be considered secure against these identified threats. Essentially, the analysis of untrusted entities informs and dictates the necessary security properties that the system must implement and maintain to protect itself."
Compare what an entity is 'expected to do' versus 'expected not to do' in the context of trust.,"In the context of trust, what an entity is 'expected to do' refers to its positive, beneficial behaviors, such as an anti-malware program detecting malicious programs or a system preventing illegal account logins. These are actions that contribute to the system's security and functionality. Conversely, what an entity is 'expected not to do' refers to harmful or undesirable behaviors it should refrain from, such as a website not exposing private data to third parties or an application not injecting viruses into the system. These are actions that would compromise security or privacy."
Why is it important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system?,"It is important to make clear what should be trusted in a cyber system because security cannot be established if no entities are trusted. Without a clear understanding of which components or entities are reliable, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. Defining trust boundaries helps in designing effective security measures by identifying the core components that must be secure and the external entities that need to be protected against."
What are the consequences if entities are not trusted in a cyber system?,"If entities are not trusted in a cyber system, security cannot be established. This implies that without a foundation of trust, the designed security solutions may fail in practice. The system would be vulnerable to various threats because there would be no reliable components to build security upon, leading to potential breaches, data loss, or system compromise."
Provide examples of what an entity is expected to do versus not to do.,"Examples of what an entity is expected to do include an anti-malware program detecting malicious programs, or a system preventing illegal account logins. These are positive security functions. Examples of what an entity is expected not to do include a website not exposing private data to third parties, or an application not injecting viruses into your system. These are actions that would compromise security or privacy and are therefore prohibited."
Define and compare the 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' with 'components outside of the TCB'.,"The 'Trusted Computing Base (TCB)' is defined as a set of components, such as software, operating systems, firmware, and hardware, that must be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. These components are assumed to be secure and reliable. In contrast, 'components outside of the TCB' are not trusted; they are considered potentially malicious and capable of misbehaving. When designing security solutions, it's crucial to assume TCB components are secure with valid justifications, while simultaneously preventing any damages from components outside the TCB."
What are the two main considerations when designing a security solution concerning the TCB?,"When designing a security solution concerning the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), there are two main considerations. First, one must assume all the components inside the TCB are secure, and this assumption must be supported with valid justifications. Second, the design must prevent any damages from components that are outside of the TCB, as these are considered potentially malicious and untrusted."
Compare the TCB design principles of 'Unbypassable (completeness)' and 'Tamper-resistant (security)'.,"The 'Unbypassable (completeness)' principle for TCB design states that there must be no way to breach system security by bypassing the TCB. This ensures that all security-critical operations are routed through the trusted components. The 'Tamper-resistant (security)' principle, on the other hand, dictates that the TCB itself should be protected against other parts outside the TCB. These external parts must not be able to modify the TCB's code or state, ensuring the integrity of the trusted components."
What are the differences between 'Tamper-resistant (security)' and 'Verifiable (correctness)' as TCB design principles?,"The 'Tamper-resistant (security)' principle for TCB design focuses on protecting the TCB from external modification. It ensures that other parts outside the TCB cannot alter its code or state, thereby preserving its integrity and security. The 'Verifiable (correctness)' principle, however, focuses on the ability to confirm the TCB's proper functioning. It states that it should be possible to verify the correctness of the TCB, ensuring that it behaves as intended and correctly enforces security policies."
Compare 'Unbypassable (completeness)' with 'Verifiable (correctness)' in TCB design.,"The 'Unbypassable (completeness)' principle in TCB design ensures that there is no loophole or alternative path to circumvent the TCB's security controls, meaning all security-critical operations must pass through it. This addresses the scope and coverage of the TCB. The 'Verifiable (correctness)' principle, conversely, focuses on the ability to prove that the TCB itself functions as intended and correctly enforces its security policies. This addresses the accuracy and reliability of the TCB's internal operations."
What are the advantages of a smaller TCB?,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) offers several advantages: it is more trustworthy because fewer components need to be assumed secure, reducing the attack surface. It is also easier to verify, as there are fewer components to inspect for correctness. This approach aligns with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, as it minimizes the number of assumptions that could potentially be violated."
What are the challenges associated with designing a secure system with a smaller TCB?,"Designing a secure system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is more challenging because it requires considering more malicious entities. When the TCB is smaller, more components fall outside of it, meaning a larger portion of the system is considered untrusted. This necessitates more robust mechanisms to prevent damage from these numerous untrusted components, increasing the complexity of the security design."
Compare the trustworthiness and ease of verification for a system with a smaller TCB versus a larger TCB.,"A system with a smaller Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is generally more trustworthy and easier to verify. It is more trustworthy because fewer components need to be assumed secure, reducing the potential for vulnerabilities within the trusted core. It is easier to verify because there are fewer components to inspect and fewer assumptions to validate, simplifying the process of ensuring its correctness. Conversely, a larger TCB would imply more components to trust and verify, potentially decreasing overall trustworthiness and increasing verification complexity."
How does the KISS principle relate to the size of the TCB?,"The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle relates to the size of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) by advocating for a smaller TCB. A smaller TCB means fewer components need to be trusted, making the system simpler, more trustworthy, and easier to verify. This simplicity reduces the number of assumptions that need to be made about the security of components, thereby decreasing the likelihood of those assumptions being violated and enhancing overall security."
What is the definition of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?,"The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as a set of components, which can include software, the operating system (OS), firmware, and hardware, that need to be trusted to ensure the security of the cyber system. These are the fundamental elements whose correct and secure operation is essential for the overall security posture of the system."
Compare an 'Active' attacker with a 'Passive' attacker.,"An 'Active' attacker is characterized by their intent to manipulate or disrupt systems. Examples of their actions include modifying data or injecting code. In contrast, a 'Passive' attacker focuses on observing and gathering information without interfering with the system's operations. Their goal is to collect data or intelligence without being detected, rather than to cause direct damage or alteration."
What are the differences in 'Attacker's knowledge' that might be assumed in a threat model?,"In a threat model, 'Attacker's knowledge' can vary significantly. One assumption is that the attacker knows the system's design, architecture, source code, and other detailed information. Another assumption is that the attacker lacks such detailed knowledge and must instead rely on probing or trial and error to discover vulnerabilities or gain information. These different levels of assumed knowledge influence the types of attacks that are considered plausible."
Compare an attacker who 'knows the system's design' with one who 'lacks detailed knowledge'.,"An attacker who 'knows the system's design, architecture, source code, etc.' has a significant advantage, as they can directly target known vulnerabilities or design flaws. This allows for more precise and potentially more effective attacks. Conversely, an attacker who 'lacks detailed knowledge' must rely on probing or trial and error. This means they will spend more time exploring the system, attempting various inputs, and observing responses to infer its structure and identify weaknesses, making their attacks potentially less efficient but still dangerous."
What aspects are considered when assessing an 'Attacker's capability'?,"When assessing an 'Attacker's capability', several aspects are considered: how much computing resources the attacker can leverage, what parts of the system the attacker can interact with, and whether the attacker has unlimited time or needs to act quickly. These factors collectively define the scope and potential impact of an attacker's actions."
Compare the implications of an attacker having 'unlimited time' versus needing to 'act quickly'.,"An attacker having 'unlimited time' implies they can conduct persistent, slow, and methodical attacks, such as extensive probing, brute-force attempts, or waiting for opportune moments, without fear of detection due to time constraints. This allows for more complex and stealthy operations. Conversely, an attacker needing to 'act quickly' suggests they are operating under time pressure, perhaps due to a limited window of opportunity or a high risk of detection. This might lead to less sophisticated but more aggressive attacks, prioritizing speed over stealth or thoroughness."
How do 'computing resources' and 'parts of the system an attacker can interact with' contribute to an attacker's capability?,"'Computing resources' contribute to an attacker's capability by determining the scale and speed of their operations. More resources allow for faster brute-force attacks, more extensive data processing, or the ability to run complex simulations. 'Parts of the system an attacker can interact with' define the attack surface and potential entry points. The more interfaces, protocols, or components an attacker can access, the more opportunities they have to find vulnerabilities and exploit them, directly impacting their ability to compromise the system."
What are the three main categories of 'Attacker's Assumption' described?,"The three main categories of 'Attacker's Assumption' described are: the 'Type of attacker', which distinguishes between active (manipulating/disrupting) and passive (observing/gathering information) attackers; 'Attacker's knowledge', which considers whether the attacker knows the system's design or lacks detailed knowledge and relies on probing; and 'Attacker's capability', which assesses their computing resources, parts of the system they can interact with, and time constraints."
What is the primary goal of an 'Active' attacker compared to a 'Passive' attacker?,"The primary goal of an 'Active' attacker is to manipulate or disrupt the systems, which can involve actions like modifying data or injecting code to cause direct harm or alter system behavior. In contrast, the primary goal of a 'Passive' attacker is to observe and gather information without interfering with the system. Their objective is intelligence collection, such as eavesdropping on communications or collecting sensitive data, without leaving a trace of their presence or causing any changes."
How does an attacker's reliance on 'probing or trial and error' differ from having detailed knowledge of a system?,"An attacker's reliance on 'probing or trial and error' signifies a lack of detailed knowledge about the system's design, architecture, or source code. This approach involves systematically testing the system's responses to various inputs to infer its structure and identify vulnerabilities, which can be time-consuming and less efficient. Conversely, an attacker having 'detailed knowledge' means they already possess information about the system's internals, allowing them to directly identify and exploit known weaknesses or design flaws, leading to more targeted and potentially faster attacks."
Compare the impact of an attacker's 'computing resources' with their 'ability to interact with parts of the system' on their overall capability.,"An attacker's 'computing resources' impact their capability by determining the scale and speed of computational tasks they can perform, such as brute-forcing passwords or running complex cryptanalysis. More resources generally mean faster and more extensive attacks. Their 'ability to interact with parts of the system' defines the attack surface and the specific vectors they can exploit. This includes access to network interfaces, APIs, or physical ports. While computing resources provide the raw power, the ability to interact with specific system parts dictates where and how that power can be applied to achieve a compromise."
