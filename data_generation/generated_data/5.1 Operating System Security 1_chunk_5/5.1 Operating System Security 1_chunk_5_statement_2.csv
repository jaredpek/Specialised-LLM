Define 'System call traces' as a type of monitored data.,System call traces are a type of monitored data that describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. These traces provide insight into the operations performed by various processes within the operating system.
What information is typically found in a 'Log file' as a type of monitored data?,"A Log file, as a type of monitored data, contains information on user activity. This includes details such as user login records, the history of commands executed, and other relevant user-initiated actions within the system."
Explain the purpose of 'File integrity checksums' in the context of monitored data.,File integrity checksums are used to periodically scan critical files for changes. Their purpose is to compare cryptographic checksums for these files against a record of known good values. This comparison helps detect unauthorized modifications or corruption of critical system files.
"What does 'Registry access' monitoring entail, and to which operating system is it specific?","Registry access monitoring involves observing and recording access to the system's registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems, where the registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry."
What kind of insight does 'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' provide?,"Kernel and driver-level monitoring provides insight into operating system (OS) kernel-level anomalies. The kernel is the core of an operating system, and drivers are software components that allow the OS to communicate with hardware devices. Monitoring these levels helps detect unusual or malicious activities occurring at the deepest layers of the OS."
How can 'Resource usage' indicate malicious behaviors?,"Resource usage, which includes CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. Unusual spikes or patterns in these resource metrics might suggest that unauthorized or harmful processes are running on the system."
What do 'Network activities' as monitored data typically include?,"Network activities, as a form of monitored data, typically include established connections and received packets. Monitoring these activities helps in understanding network traffic patterns and detecting suspicious communications or data transfers."
Define an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. Its primary function is to monitor network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and produce reports to a management station.
In what different layers can an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) be implemented?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be implemented at different layers. These layers include network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitors network traffic, and host-based IDS (HIDS), which monitors the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities."
What is the primary focus of a host-based IDS?,"The primary focus of a host-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is to monitor the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. This involves observing events and activities occurring on a specific computer system, such as file access, system calls, and user actions."
List the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: Sensors, Analyzers, and a User interface. Each component plays a distinct role in the overall functionality of the IDS."
What is the responsibility of 'Sensors' within an IDS?,"Within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Sensors are responsible for collecting data. This data can come from various sources, such as system call traces, log files, network activities, and resource usage, which are then fed to other IDS components for analysis."
Describe the role of 'Analyzers' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"Analyzers in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and identifying the possible evidence. They process the data collected by sensors to detect patterns indicative of malicious activity. Additionally, analyzers may provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion."
What is the function of the 'User interface' component of an IDS?,"The User interface component of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. It provides a means for administrators to interact with the IDS, review alerts, configure settings, and manage its operations."
Define 'Signature-based detection' in the context of detection methodologies.,"Signature-based detection is a methodology that flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. It operates by maintaining a database of known attack patterns, or 'signatures,' and comparing system activities against these patterns."
Explain the concept of 'blacklisting' as it applies to signature-based detection.,"In signature-based detection, 'blacklisting' refers to keeping a list of patterns that are not allowed. If the system detects any activity or pattern that matches an entry on this blacklist, it will generate an alert, indicating a potential intrusion or malicious activity."
What is an advantage of using signature-based detection?,"An advantage of using signature-based detection is that it is simple and easy to build. It is also good at detecting known attacks because it relies on predefined patterns of malicious activity, making it efficient for identifying previously identified threats."
What is a disadvantage of signature-based detection?,A significant disadvantage of signature-based detection is that it cannot catch new attacks without a known signature. This means it is ineffective against zero-day exploits or novel attack methods for which no signature has yet been developed and added to its database.
Define 'Anomaly-based detection' in the context of detection methodologies.,"Anomaly-based detection is a methodology that involves developing a model of what normal activities look like. It then alerts on any activities that deviate from these established normal activities, indicating a potential intrusion or unusual behavior."
Explain the concept of 'whitelisting' as it applies to anomaly-based detection.,"In anomaly-based detection, 'whitelisting' refers to keeping a list of allowed patterns. If the system detects something that is not on this list of allowed patterns, it will generate an alert. This approach assumes that anything not explicitly permitted is potentially suspicious."
What is an advantage of using anomaly-based detection?,"An advantage of using anomaly-based detection is its ability to detect attacks that have not been seen before. By identifying deviations from normal behavior, it can potentially catch novel threats, including zero-day attacks, for which no specific signature exists."
What is a disadvantage of anomaly-based detection?,"A disadvantage of anomaly-based detection is that its false positive rate can be high. This means that many non-attacks might look unusual to the system's model of normal activity, leading to frequent alerts for legitimate but uncommon events."
List the Security Protection Stages in an Operating System (OS).,"The Security Protection Stages in an Operating System (OS) include Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing. These stages work together to secure the system and its resources."
What is 'Privilege Management in OS'?,"Privilege Management in OS refers to the mechanisms and policies within an operating system that control and regulate the permissions and capabilities granted to users, processes, and other entities. It ensures that entities can only perform actions for which they have the necessary authorization."
Describe the privilege levels of 'Kernel mode' and 'User mode' in an OS.,"In an OS, Kernel mode has the highest privilege, running the critical functions and services of the operating system. User mode, in contrast, has the least privilege, where user applications and less critical processes operate. This distinction helps protect the integrity and stability of the OS."
What restriction applies to entities in higher privilege rings regarding lower rings?,"Entities in the higher privilege rings cannot directly call the functions and access the objects in the lower rings. This restriction is a fundamental aspect of the ring-based security model, designed to prevent less privileged code from directly interfering with or compromising more privileged system components."
What is required to achieve procedures like system calls and interrupts when transitioning between privilege levels?,"A context switch is required to achieve procedures like system calls, interrupts, and other operations that involve transitioning between different privilege levels (e.g., from user mode to kernel mode). A context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point."
What is the role of a 'Status flag' in allowing a system to work in different modes?,"A Status flag allows the system to work in different modes, such as user mode and kernel mode. This flag is a register or a bit within a register that indicates the current operating mode of the CPU, dictating the level of privileges and access rights available to the executing code."
List the different events that can trigger the transition from user to kernel levels.,"The different events that can trigger the transition from user to kernel levels include a System call, a Trap, and a Hardware interrupt. These events necessitate the operating system kernel to take control to perform privileged operations or handle exceptional conditions."
Define 'System call' as an event that triggers a transition from user to kernel levels.,"As an event triggering a transition from user to kernel levels, a System call occurs when a user application explicitly makes a request to the kernel for privileged operations. These operations include tasks like file I/O, process creation, or memory management that user applications are not allowed to perform directly."
What is a 'Trap' in the context of user to kernel level transitions?,"A Trap, in the context of user to kernel level transitions, occurs when a user application encounters an exceptional event or an error and requests the kernel to handle it. This could be due to a division by zero, an invalid memory access, or other program errors that require OS intervention."
Define 'Hardware interrupt' as an event that triggers a transition from user to kernel levels.,"A Hardware interrupt is an event where hardware issues a signal to the CPU to indicate that an event needs immediate attention. This signal causes the CPU to temporarily suspend its current execution and switch to kernel mode to handle the interrupt, such as data arriving from a network card or a disk I/O completion."
"Which types of events, among system calls, traps, and hardware interrupts, belong to software interrupts?",Both System call and Trap events belong to software interrupts. These are events initiated by software (either explicitly by an application or implicitly due to an error) that cause a change in the CPU's execution flow and often a transition to kernel mode.
Describe the first step in the 'Switch procedure' during a context switch.,"The first step in the 'Switch procedure' during a context switch is that the CPU stores the process's states. This involves saving the current values of registers, program counter, and other relevant context information of the running process, and then switches to the kernel mode by setting the status flag."
How does the Kernel handle an interrupt during the switch procedure?,"During the switch procedure, the Kernel handles the interrupt based on the interrupt vector in an interrupt table. The interrupt vector is an entry in a table that points to the specific interrupt handler routine designed to address the particular type of interrupt that occurred."
What happens after the Kernel handles an interrupt in the switch procedure?,"After the Kernel handles an interrupt in the switch procedure, the CPU switches back to user mode and restores states. This means the CPU reloads the saved context of the user process that was interrupted, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off."
"What is a system call, in terms of its function as an interface?","A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. It acts as a programmatic interface to the services provided by the operating system, enabling applications to interact with hardware and other system resources in a controlled and secure manner."
List the categories of functions or services that a system call can request from the kernel level.,"A system call can request functions or services from the kernel level across several categories, including Process control, File management, and Device management. These categories encompass a wide range of operations necessary for applications to run and interact with the system."
Define 'System call table' and its purpose in issuing a system call.,"A System call table is a table of pointers located in the kernel region. Its purpose is to point to different system call functions. When a user process issues a system call, it uses an index to look up the corresponding function in this table, allowing the kernel to execute the requested service."
How does a user process pass the index and parameters when issuing a system call?,"A user process passes the index of the system call and its parameters using an Application Programming Interface (API) typically structured as `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`. `SYS_call` represents the index of the desired system call, and `arg1, arg2, ...` are the arguments required by that specific system call function."
Provide three examples of system calls mentioned in the document.,"Three examples of system calls mentioned in the document are `sys_waitpid`, `sys_exit`, and `sys_fork`. Other examples include `sys_read`, `sys_write`, `sys_open`, and `sys_close`, all of which facilitate specific interactions between user processes and the kernel."
What is a 'Rootkit'?,"A Rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise the computer. It is a collection of software tools that enable root-level access to a computer or network, while simultaneously attempting to hide its presence from administrators and security software."
What is a key characteristic of a 'Root user' in terms of security checks?,"A key characteristic of a 'Root user' is that it does not go through any security checks. This means a root user, or a process operating with root privileges, can bypass standard security mechanisms and perform any actions to the system without restriction."
What are two primary actions a root user can perform once root privileges are obtained?,"Once root privileges are obtained, a root user can perform two primary actions: first, insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path; and second, hide its existence, for example, by concealing malicious processes, files, or network sockets from being detected."
"How can an attacker gain root privileges, according to the document?","According to the document, an attacker can gain root privileges through vulnerabilities in the software stack. Specific examples of such vulnerabilities include buffer overflow and format string vulnerabilities, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges."
"What is the highest privilege level in an operating system, and what does it run?","The highest privilege level in an operating system is Kernel mode. It runs the critical functions and services of the operating system, which are essential for the system's operation and security."
"What is the least privilege level in an operating system, and what typically operates in it?","The least privilege level in an operating system is User mode. User applications typically operate in this mode, which has restricted access to system resources and critical functions to ensure system stability and security."
"What is the general principle behind 'Logging, Monitoring & Auditing' as a security protection stage in an OS?","The general principle behind 'Logging, Monitoring & Auditing' as a security protection stage in an OS is to record system activities, observe them for suspicious patterns, and review these records to ensure compliance and detect security incidents. This provides a historical trail and real-time insights into system behavior."
What is the purpose of 'Authentication' as a security protection stage in an OS?,"The purpose of 'Authentication' as a security protection stage in an OS is to verify the identity of a user or process attempting to access the system. It ensures that only legitimate entities can gain initial access by confirming their claimed identity, typically through credentials like passwords or biometric data."
What is the purpose of 'Authorization with Access Control' as a security protection stage in an OS?,"The purpose of 'Authorization with Access Control' as a security protection stage in an OS is to determine what authenticated users or processes are permitted to do once they have gained access. Access control mechanisms enforce policies that specify which resources (e.g., files, devices) can be accessed and what operations (e.g., read, write, execute) can be performed on them."
