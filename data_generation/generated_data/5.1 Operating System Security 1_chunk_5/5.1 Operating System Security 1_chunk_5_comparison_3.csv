Compare signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection.,"Signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection are two distinct methodologies used for intrusion detection.\n\n**Signature-based detection** flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. It operates on a principle of **blacklisting**, where it maintains a list of patterns that are not allowed and alerts if any activity matches an item on this list. Its primary advantage is that it is simple and easy to build, and it is good at detecting known attacks. However, its main disadvantage is that it cannot catch new attacks without a known signature.\n\n**Anomaly-based detection**, in contrast, develops a model of what normal activities look like and alerts on any activities that deviate from these normal activities. It operates on a principle of **whitelisting**, where it keeps a list of allowed patterns and alerts if something is not on this list. An advantage of anomaly-based detection is its ability to detect attacks that have not been seen before. A significant disadvantage, however, is that its false positive rate can be high, as many non-attacks might look unusual."
What are the differences between blacklisting and whitelisting in detection methodologies?,"Blacklisting and whitelisting are two approaches used within detection methodologies, primarily in signature-based and anomaly-based detection, respectively.\n\n**Blacklisting** is a concept used in **signature-based detection**. It involves keeping a list of patterns that are explicitly not allowed. If the system observes any activity that matches an item on this blacklist, it triggers an alert. This method is effective for identifying known malicious activities.\n\n**Whitelisting** is a concept used in **anomaly-based detection**. It involves maintaining a list of allowed patterns or activities. The system alerts if it detects something that is not present on this whitelist, indicating a deviation from normal or expected behavior. This method is useful for detecting novel or unknown threats."
Compare the advantages of signature-based detection versus anomaly-based detection.,"The advantages of signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection differ based on their underlying mechanisms.\n\n**Signature-based detection** offers the advantage of being simple and easy to build. It is particularly good at detecting known attacks because it flags activities that match predefined patterns of these attacks.\n\n**Anomaly-based detection** has the advantage of being able to detect attacks that have not been seen before. This is because it identifies deviations from a model of normal activities, rather than relying on a database of known attack signatures."
What are the disadvantages of signature-based detection compared to anomaly-based detection?,"The disadvantages of signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection highlight their respective limitations.\n\nFor **signature-based detection**, the primary disadvantage is its inability to catch new attacks without a known signature. If an attack pattern is not in its blacklist, it will not be detected.\n\nFor **anomaly-based detection**, a significant disadvantage is that its false positive rate can be high. This means it may frequently alert on activities that are not actual attacks but merely look unusual, leading to potential alert fatigue or unnecessary investigations."
Compare System call traces with Log files as examples of monitored data.,"System call traces and log files are both types of data collected by the OS for monitoring, but they capture different aspects of system activity.\n\n**System call traces** describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system.

Monitoring at this level helps detect deep-seated issues or malicious activities affecting the core of the OS.\n\n**Resource usage** monitoring focuses on the utilization and activities of system resources such as CPU, memory, or I/O. Abnormal patterns in these metrics can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors, such as excessive resource consumption by malware."
What are the differences between Network-based IDS and Host-based IDS?,"Network-based IDS and Host-based IDS are two different implementations of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), distinguished by their scope of monitoring.\n\nAn **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems.\n\n**Network-based IDS** monitors network traffic for suspicious activity. It is typically placed at strategic points in a network to monitor traffic to and from all devices on the network.\n\n**Host-based IDS** monitors the characteristics of a single host (a computer or other device connected to a network) for suspicious activities.

Compare Kernel mode and User mode in terms of privilege within an OS.,"Kernel mode and User mode are two fundamental operating modes within an Operating System (OS), differentiated by their privilege levels.\n\n**Kernel mode** has the highest privilege. In this mode, the operating system runs critical functions and services, having direct access to hardware and memory. Operations performed in kernel mode are considered trusted.\n\n**User mode** has the least privilege. Applications and user programs typically run in this mode. They do not have direct access to hardware and must request services from the kernel through mechanisms like system calls to perform privileged operations."
What are the differences between a System call and a Trap in the context of a context switch?,"System calls and Traps are both events that can trigger a transition from user to kernel levels, often involving a context switch, but they originate from different circumstances.\n\nA **Context switch** is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point, and then loading the state of another process or thread.\n\nA **System call** occurs when a user application explicitly makes a request to the kernel for privileged operations. This is a deliberate action by the application to access kernel services, such as file management or process control.\n\nA **Trap** occurs when a user application encounters an exceptional event or an error and requests the kernel to handle it. This is typically an unexpected event, like a division-by-zero error or an invalid memory access, that requires the kernel's intervention."
Compare software interrupts with hardware interrupts.,"Software interrupts and hardware interrupts are both mechanisms that cause the CPU to suspend its current task and execute a special routine, but they are triggered by different sources.\n\n**Software interrupts** are triggered by software events. In the context of an operating system, system calls and traps belong to software interrupts. A **system call** is an explicit request from a user application to the kernel for privileged operations, while a **trap** is an exceptional event or error encountered by a user application that requires kernel handling.\n\n**Hardware interrupts** are signals issued by hardware to the CPU to indicate that an event needs immediate attention. These can originate from external hardware devices, such as a disk controller signaling data readiness or a network card receiving packets."

What are the differences between Ring 0 and Ring 3 in the context of privileged rings inside an OS?,"Ring 0 and Ring 3 represent different privilege levels within the hierarchical structure of privileged rings inside an Operating System (OS).\n\n**Ring 0** is the innermost ring, representing the highest privilege level. The kernel typically operates in Ring 0, running critical functions and services with direct access to hardware and memory. This is considered the 'Most privileged' level.\n\n**Ring 3** is the outermost ring, representing the least privilege level. User applications typically operate in Ring 3. Entities in Ring 3 have restricted access to system resources and must rely on system calls to request privileged operations from higher rings. This is considered the 'Least privileged' level."
Compare the process of a System call with the process of a Hardware interrupt in triggering a context switch.,"Both a System call and a Hardware interrupt can trigger a context switch, leading to a transition from user to kernel levels, but they originate differently.\n\nA **System call** is an interface that allows a user-level process to explicitly request functions or services from the kernel level. When a user application makes a system call, it deliberately initiates a transition to kernel mode to perform a privileged operation.\n\nA **Hardware interrupt** occurs when a hardware component issues a signal to the CPU, indicating that an event needs immediate attention. This is an asynchronous event, external to the currently running software, that forces the CPU to switch to kernel mode to handle the hardware's request."

Compare the role of the `syscall()` API with the System call table in issuing a system call.,"The `syscall()` API and the System call table are both integral to how a system call is issued and handled, but they serve different functions.\n\nA **System call** is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level.\n\nThe **`syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)` API** is the mechanism through which a user process passes the index of the system call (represented by `SYS_call`) and its parameters (`arg1, arg2, ...`) to initiate a system call. This is the programmatic interface used by applications.\n\nThe **System call table** is a table of pointers located in the kernel region.
