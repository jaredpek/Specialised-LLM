What are system call traces in the context of monitored data?,"System call traces describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed, and its activities include the operations it performs and the resources it accesses."
What kind of information is typically found in a log file as a type of monitored data?,A log file typically contains information on user activity. This includes specific details such as a user's login record and the history of commands executed by users. User activity refers to the actions performed by individuals interacting with the system.
Explain the purpose and mechanism of file integrity checksums as a monitored data type.,"File integrity checksums are used to periodically scan critical files for changes. Their mechanism involves comparing cryptographic checksums for these files against a record of known good values. A cryptographic checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from a larger block of digital data, used to detect errors or unauthorized modifications."
What is registry access monitoring and to which operating systems is it specific?,Registry access monitoring involves observing and recording access to the system's registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems. The registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry.
What insights does kernel and driver-level monitoring provide?,Kernel and driver-level monitoring provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies. The kernel is the core part of an operating system that manages system resources and provides services for other parts of the operating system and applications. Anomalies refer to deviations from what is considered normal or expected behavior.
How can resource usage monitoring indicate malicious behavior?,"Resource usage monitoring tracks CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities. Abnormal utilization or activities in these areas can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions, memory refers to the computer's temporary storage, and I/O (Input/Output) refers to communication between the system and external devices."
What do network activities include as a type of monitored data?,"Network activities, as a type of monitored data, include established connections and received packets. Established connections refer to active communication links between two network endpoints. Received packets are units of data transmitted over a network."
What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. An intrusion is an unauthorized access to or activity within a computer system, often with malicious intent."
At what different layers can an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) be implemented?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be implemented at different layers, including network-based IDS and host-based IDS. A network-based IDS monitors network traffic, while a host-based IDS monitors a single computer system."
What is the primary focus of a host-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,A host-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) primarily focuses on monitoring the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. A host refers to a computer or other device connected to a computer network.
What are the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: Sensors, Analyzers, and a User interface. Sensors are responsible for collecting data. Analyzers determine if an intrusion has occurred and identify evidence. The User interface enables a user to view output and control the system."
What is the role of Sensors within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"Within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Sensors are responsible for collecting data. Data collection involves gathering various types of information from the monitored environment, such as system logs, network traffic, or system call traces."
Describe the function of Analyzers in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,Analyzers in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and identifying the possible evidence. They may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion. An intrusion is an unauthorized access or activity.
What is the purpose of the User interface component in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,The User interface component in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system. A user interface is the means by which a user interacts with a computer system.
What is signature-based detection in the context of intrusion detection methodologies?,"Signature-based detection is an intrusion detection methodology that flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. A signature, in this context, is a specific pattern or characteristic of a known malicious activity, such as a virus or malware."
How does blacklisting relate to signature-based detection?,"In signature-based detection, blacklisting involves keeping a list of patterns that are not allowed. The system then alerts if it detects something that matches an entry on this list. A pattern refers to a recognizable characteristic or sequence of events associated with a known attack."
What is an advantage of using signature-based detection?,"An advantage of using signature-based detection is that it is simple and easy to build. Furthermore, it is highly effective at detecting known attacks, which are those for which a specific signature or pattern has already been identified and cataloged."
What is a disadvantage of signature-based detection?,A disadvantage of signature-based detection is its inability to catch new attacks without a known signature. This means it cannot detect novel threats or zero-day exploits for which no specific pattern has yet been defined in its blacklist.
What is anomaly-based detection?,"Anomaly-based detection is a methodology that involves developing a model of what normal activities look like. It then alerts on any activities that deviate from these normal activities. Normal activities are the baseline behaviors and patterns expected within a system, established through learning or configuration."
How is whitelisting used in anomaly-based detection?,"In anomaly-based detection, whitelisting involves keeping a list of allowed patterns. The system then alerts if it detects something that is not on this list. Allowed patterns are the predefined behaviors or characteristics that are considered legitimate and safe for the system."
What is an advantage of anomaly-based detection?,"An advantage of anomaly-based detection is its ability to detect attacks that have not been seen before. This includes novel attacks or zero-day exploits for which no specific signature exists yet, by identifying deviations from normal system behavior."
What is a disadvantage of anomaly-based detection?,"A disadvantage of anomaly-based detection is that its false positive rate can be high, meaning many non-attacks may look unusual and trigger alerts. A false positive occurs when the system incorrectly identifies a legitimate activity as malicious or anomalous."
Compare signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection in terms of their core mechanisms.,"Signature-based detection flags activities that match the structure of a known attack, operating on a blacklisting principle where disallowed patterns are identified. Anomaly-based detection develops a model of normal activities and alerts on deviations, using a whitelisting principle where only allowed patterns are permitted. A known attack refers to a malicious activity with a predefined signature, while normal activities are the established baseline behaviors of a system."
What is the privilege level of kernel mode in an operating system?,"Kernel mode has the highest privilege level in an operating system. In this mode, the system runs critical functions and services. Privilege refers to the level of access rights or permissions granted to a process or user within a system."
What is the privilege level of user mode in an operating system?,"User mode has the least privilege in an operating system. This mode is typically where user applications run, with restricted access to system resources compared to kernel mode. Applications are software programs designed for end-users."
How do entities in higher privilege rings interact with functions and objects in lower rings?,"Entities in higher privilege rings cannot directly call the functions and access the objects in the lower rings. A context switch is required to achieve such procedures, including system calls or interrupts. A privilege ring is a mechanism used to protect data and functionality from faults and malicious behavior by organizing code into hierarchical levels of trust."
When is a context switch required in the context of operating modes?,"A context switch is required to achieve procedures such as system calls, interrupts, and other transitions between different operating modes, particularly when entities in higher privilege rings need to interact with lower rings. A context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored later, and then restoring a different state for another process or thread."
What is the purpose of a status flag in enabling different operating modes?,"A status flag allows the system to work in different modes, such as kernel mode and user mode. This flag indicates the current operational state or privilege level of the CPU, dictating what operations are permitted. An operating mode defines the set of privileges and resources available to the executing code."
Which component of the operating system typically resides in Ring 0?,"The Kernel typically resides in Ring 0. Ring 0 represents the most privileged level within the operating system's hierarchical protection rings, granting the kernel full access to hardware and system resources. The Kernel is the central part of an operating system."
Which components of the operating system typically reside in Ring 3?,"Applications typically reside in Ring 3. Ring 3 represents the least privileged level within the operating system's hierarchical protection rings, where user applications run with restricted access to system resources. Applications are software programs designed for end-users."
Where do device drivers typically reside in the operating system's privilege rings?,"Device drivers typically reside in rings between the Kernel (Ring 0) and Applications (Ring 3), specifically in Ring 1 or Ring 2, as depicted in the privilege ring model. This placement grants them more privilege than user applications but less than the kernel, allowing them to interact with hardware while maintaining a degree of isolation from the core OS. Device drivers are software components that allow the operating system to communicate with a hardware device."
How does a system call trigger a transition from user to kernel level?,A system call triggers a transition from user to kernel level when a user application explicitly makes a request to the kernel for privileged operations. This request is a software interrupt that necessitates a change in the CPU's execution mode to handle the operation with appropriate privileges. A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level.
What is a trap and how does it trigger a transition to kernel level?,"A trap occurs when a user application encounters an exceptional event or error and requests the kernel to handle it. This event acts as a software interrupt, triggering a transition to kernel level so that the operating system can manage the error or exception with elevated privileges. An exceptional event or error is an unexpected condition that arises during program execution, such as a division by zero or an invalid memory access."
How does a hardware interrupt trigger a transition to kernel level?,"A hardware interrupt triggers a transition to kernel level when hardware issues a signal to the CPU to indicate that an event needs immediate attention. This signal causes the CPU to suspend its current task and switch to kernel mode to handle the hardware event. A hardware interrupt is an electronic signal sent by a hardware device to the CPU, indicating that it requires attention."
Which types of events that trigger context switches are considered software interrupts?,"System calls and traps are considered software interrupts. A software interrupt is an interrupt generated by a software instruction, typically used to request services from the operating system kernel or to handle exceptional conditions within a program."
What is the first step in the CPU's switch procedure during a context switch?,"The first step in the CPU's switch procedure during a context switch is to store the process's states and then switch to kernel mode by setting the status flag. Process states include information such as the program counter, registers, and memory management information, which are necessary to resume the process later."
How does the kernel handle an interrupt during the switch procedure?,"During the switch procedure, the kernel handles the interrupt based on the interrupt vector in an interrupt table. An interrupt vector is an entry in the interrupt table that contains the memory address of the interrupt handler routine for a specific interrupt. An interrupt table is a data structure that maps interrupt numbers to specific interrupt handler routines."
What is the final step in the CPU's switch procedure after handling an interrupt?,"The final step in the CPU's switch procedure after handling an interrupt is for the CPU to switch back to user mode and restore the states of the interrupted process. Restoring states means loading the previously saved program counter, registers, and other context information, allowing the user application to resume execution from where it left off."
Provide a definition for a system call.,"A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. It acts as a programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on, such as accessing hardware or creating files."
What are the main categories of functions or services that a user-level process can request from the kernel via a system call?,"A user-level process can request functions or services from the kernel via a system call in categories such as Process control, File management, and Device management. Process control involves operations like creating or terminating processes. File management includes operations like reading, writing, or creating files. Device management involves interacting with hardware devices."
What is a system call table and its purpose?,"A system call table is a table of pointers located in the kernel region. Its purpose is to map different system call functions to their respective entry points, allowing the kernel to locate and execute the correct function when a system call is made. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses."
How does a user process typically issue a system call using an API?,"A user process typically issues a system call by passing the index of the desired system call and its parameters using an API (Application Programming Interface) such as `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`. The `SYS_call` argument specifies which kernel function to invoke, and `arg1, arg2, ...` are the arguments required by that function. An API is a set of defined rules that describe how applications can communicate with each other."
What is a rootkit?,"A rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Root privileges refer to the highest level of access rights on a Unix-like operating system, equivalent to an administrator on Windows."
What capabilities does a root user possess in a compromised system?,"In a compromised system, a root user does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions to the system. This includes unrestricted access to all files, processes, and system configurations. A root user is the superuser account in Unix-like operating systems that has all privileges."
How do rootkits typically execute malicious code?,"Rootkits typically execute malicious code by inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code directly into the system's code path. This allows them to run their code with the highest privileges, often by modifying legitimate system processes or libraries. Arbitrary malicious code refers to any code designed to perform harmful or unauthorized actions."
How do rootkits hide their existence on a compromised system?,"Rootkits hide their existence by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets from being detected. They achieve this by intercepting and modifying operating system API calls that legitimate programs use to query system information, effectively filtering out any traces of the rootkit. A network socket is an endpoint of a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across a computer network."
How can an attacker gain root privileges to install a rootkit?,"An attacker can gain root privileges by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software stack, such as buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities. Exploiting these weaknesses allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, which can then be used to install a rootkit. A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond its allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory."
What are some general techniques rootkits use to compromise systems?,"Rootkits compromise systems by obtaining root privileges, which allows them to insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path and hide their existence, for example, by concealing malicious processes, files, or network sockets from detection. These techniques often leverage software vulnerabilities to gain initial access and elevate privileges."
What are the security protection stages mentioned for an Operating System?,"The security protection stages mentioned for an Operating System include Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or process. Authorization with Access Control determines what an authenticated user or process is permitted to do. Logging, Monitoring & Auditing involves recording system events, observing system activities, and reviewing logs for security incidents."
What is Privilege Management in an Operating System?,"Privilege Management in an Operating System refers to the mechanisms and policies that control the access rights and permissions granted to users, processes, and other entities within the system. This ensures that operations are performed with the minimum necessary privileges, enhancing system security. Privilege refers to the level of access rights or permissions granted to a process or user within a system."
