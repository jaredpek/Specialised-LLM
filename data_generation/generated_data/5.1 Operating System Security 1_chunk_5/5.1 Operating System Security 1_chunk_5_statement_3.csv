List the different types of data that the Operating System (OS) collects at various layers.,"The Operating System (OS) collects several types of data at different layers, including:\n\n*   **System call traces:** These describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system.\n*   **Log file:** This contains information on user activity, such as user login records and history of commands.\n*   **File integrity checksums:** These are used to periodically scan critical files for changes and compare cryptographic checksums for these files against a record of known good values.\n*   **Registry access:** This monitors access to the registry, which is specific to Windows operating systems.\n*   **Kernel and driver-level monitoring:** This source provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies.\n*   **Resource usage:** This includes CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, which can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors.\n*   **Network activities:** These encompass established connections and received packets."
Explain what 'System call traces' refer to in the context of monitored data.,"In the context of monitored data, **System call traces** describe the activities or behaviors of processes running in the system. A **system call** is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level."
What kind of information is typically found in a 'Log file' as a type of monitored data?,"A **Log file**, as a type of monitored data, typically contains information on user activity. This includes details such as a user's login record and the history of commands executed."
Describe the purpose of 'File integrity checksums' in data monitoring.,"The purpose of **File integrity checksums** in data monitoring is to periodically scan critical files for changes. They achieve this by comparing cryptographic checksums for these files with a record of known good values. A **cryptographic checksum** is a value computed from a block of data, used to detect accidental or intentional changes to the data."
"What does 'Registry access' monitoring involve, and to which operating systems is it specific?",**Registry access** monitoring involves observing access to the registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems. The **registry** is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry.
How does 'Kernel and driver-level monitoring' contribute to understanding OS behavior?,"**Kernel and driver-level monitoring** provides insight into OS kernel-level anomalies. The **kernel** is the central part of an operating system, managing operations of the computer and hardware, while **drivers** are software components that allow the operating system and a computer program to interact with a hardware device."
What can 'Resource usage' monitoring indicate regarding system security?,"**Resource usage** monitoring, which tracks CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. **Memory** refers to the physical devices used to store programs or data. **I/O (Input/Output)** refers to the communication between an information processing system and the outside world."
What types of information are included in 'Network activities' as monitored data?,"**Network activities** as monitored data include established connections and received packets. An **established connection** refers to a communication link that has been successfully set up between two network endpoints, and **packets** are small units of data transmitted over a network."
Define an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. An **intrusion** refers to any unauthorized activity on a computer network or system.
How can an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) be implemented at different layers?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be implemented at different layers. These implementations include **network-based IDS** and **host-based IDS**. A **network-based IDS** monitors network traffic for suspicious activity, while a **host-based IDS** monitors the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities."
What is the primary focus of a host-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,The primary focus of a **host-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is to monitor the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. A **host** in this context refers to a computer or other device connected to a network.
Name the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: **Sensors**, **Analyzers**, and a **User interface**."
Describe the role of 'Sensors' within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,"Within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), **Sensors** are responsible for collecting data. This data is then used by other components of the IDS to detect intrusions."
What is the function of 'Analyzers' in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,The function of **Analyzers** in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is to determine if an intrusion has occurred and to identify the possible evidence related to it. They may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the intrusion. An **intrusion** is any unauthorized activity on a computer network or system.
Explain the purpose of the 'User interface' component in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).,The purpose of the **User interface** component in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is to enable a user to view output from the system or to control the behavior of the system. This allows administrators to interact with the IDS and manage its operations.
Define 'Signature-based detection' as a methodology for intrusion detection.,**Signature-based detection** is a methodology for intrusion detection that flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. This method relies on identifying specific patterns or signatures associated with malicious activities. A **signature** in this context is a unique pattern or characteristic of a known threat.
How does 'blacklisting' relate to Signature-based detection?,"**Blacklisting** is a core concept in Signature-based detection. It involves keeping a list of patterns that are not allowed. If the system detects something that matches an entry on this blacklist, it will generate an alert. A **blacklist** is a list of items, such as IP addresses, email addresses, or file hashes, that are explicitly denied access or privileges."
What is an advantage of using Signature-based detection?,An advantage of using **Signature-based detection** is that it is simple and easy to build. It is also good at detecting known attacks because it relies on predefined patterns or signatures of those attacks.
What is a disadvantage of Signature-based detection?,A disadvantage of **Signature-based detection** is that it cannot catch new attacks without a known signature. This means it is ineffective against zero-day exploits or novel attack methods for which no signature has yet been defined.
Explain 'Anomaly-based detection' as an intrusion detection methodology.,**Anomaly-based detection** is an intrusion detection methodology that involves developing a model of what normal activities look like. It then alerts on any activities that deviate from these normal activities. This approach aims to identify previously unknown threats by detecting unusual behavior.
How does 'whitelisting' function within Anomaly-based detection?,"**Whitelisting** functions within Anomaly-based detection by keeping a list of allowed patterns. If the system detects something that is not on this whitelist, it will generate an alert. A **whitelist** is a list of items, such as applications or IP addresses, that are explicitly permitted access or privileges."
What is an advantage of Anomaly-based detection?,"An advantage of **Anomaly-based detection** is its ability to detect attacks that have not been seen before. By identifying deviations from normal behavior, it can potentially catch novel threats and zero-day exploits."
What is a disadvantage of Anomaly-based detection?,"A disadvantage of **Anomaly-based detection** is that its false positive rate can be high. This means that many non-attacks might look unusual and trigger alerts, leading to a significant number of false alarms that require investigation."
List the Security Protection Stages in an Operating System (OS).,"The Security Protection Stages in an Operating System (OS) include: **Authentication**, **Authorization with Access Control**, and **Logging, Monitoring & Auditing**."
What are the main topics covered under the 'Outline' of security in an OS?,"The main topics covered under the 'Outline' of security in an OS are **Security Protection Stages in OS** and **Privilege Management in OS**. The Security Protection Stages include Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing."
Describe the concept of 'Operating modes' in the context of Privileged Rings Inside OS.,"In the context of **Privileged Rings Inside OS**, 'Operating modes' refer to different privilege levels within the operating system. **Kernel mode** has the highest privilege, running critical functions and services, while **user mode** has the least privilege. These modes dictate what operations a process can perform and what resources it can access."
Differentiate between Kernel mode and User mode in terms of privilege.,"**Kernel mode** has the highest privilege, allowing it to run critical functions and services of the operating system. In contrast, **user mode** has the least privilege, restricting processes to a limited set of operations and resources. This distinction is fundamental to the security and stability of an OS."
Explain the restriction on entities in higher rings regarding lower rings in an OS.,"Entities in the higher rings cannot directly call the functions and access the objects in the lower rings. This hierarchical structure, often visualized as concentric rings (e.g., Ring 3, Ring 2, Ring 1, Ring 0), enforces privilege separation, where higher-numbered rings have less privilege than lower-numbered rings."
What is required to achieve procedures like system calls or interrupts when transitioning between privilege levels?,"A **Context switch** is required to achieve procedures like system calls, interrupts, and other operations that involve transitioning between different privilege levels (e.g., from user mode to kernel mode). A **context switch** is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and execution can be resumed from the same point later, and then loading the state of another process or thread."
What role does a 'Status flag' play in allowing a system to work in different operating modes?,"A **Status flag** allows the system to work in different operating modes. This flag is a register bit that indicates the current operating mode (e.g., user mode or kernel mode) and is used by the CPU to enforce privilege levels and control access to system resources."
Identify the components associated with Ring 0 and Ring 3 in the privileged rings model.,"In the privileged rings model, **Ring 0** is associated with the **Kernel**, which has the most privilege. **Ring 3** is associated with **Applications**, which have the least privilege. The rings represent a hierarchy of privilege levels, with lower numbers indicating higher privilege."
Which components are typically found in Ring 1 and Ring 2 of the privileged rings model?,"In the privileged rings model, **Ring 1** and **Ring 2** are typically associated with **Device drivers**. These rings have intermediate privilege levels, allowing device drivers to interact with hardware while still being somewhat isolated from the highly privileged kernel (Ring 0) and less privileged applications (Ring 3)."
List the different events that can trigger a transition from user to kernel levels.,"Different events can trigger the transition from user to kernel levels. These include a **System call**, a **Trap**, and a **Hardware interrupt**."
Define a 'System call' in the context of triggering a user-to-kernel transition.,A **System call** is an event that triggers a user-to-kernel transition when a user application explicitly makes a request to the kernel for privileged operations. This is a deliberate action by the application to access kernel services.
What is a 'Trap' and how does it cause a transition from user to kernel levels?,"A **Trap** is an event that causes a transition from user to kernel levels when a user application encounters an exceptional event or error and requests the kernel to handle it. Unlike a system call, a trap is often an unexpected event that requires kernel intervention."
How does a 'Hardware interrupt' trigger a transition to kernel level?,"A **Hardware interrupt** triggers a transition to kernel level when hardware issues a signal to the CPU to indicate that an event needs immediate attention. This allows the operating system to respond to external events, such as I/O completion or timer expiration."
Which types of user-to-kernel transition events are considered 'software interrupts'?,**System call** and **Trap** events are both considered software interrupts. They are initiated by software (user applications) to request services or handle exceptions at the kernel level.
Outline the first step in the 'Switch procedure' during a context switch to kernel mode.,"The first step in the 'Switch procedure' during a context switch to kernel mode is that the **CPU stores the process's states** and then **switches to the kernel mode by setting the status flag**. The **process's states** include information like register values, program counter, and stack pointer, which are necessary to resume the process later."
How does the kernel handle an interrupt during the switch procedure?,"During the switch procedure, the kernel handles the interrupt based on the **interrupt vector** in an **interrupt table**. The **interrupt table** is a data structure that maps interrupt numbers to specific interrupt handler routines, allowing the kernel to execute the appropriate code for each type of interrupt."
What is the final step in the 'Switch procedure' after an interrupt has been handled?,"The final step in the 'Switch procedure' after an interrupt has been handled is that the **CPU switches back to user mode and restores states**. This means the CPU reloads the saved process states, allowing the interrupted user application to resume execution from where it left off."
What is the fundamental definition of a 'system call'?,A **system call** is fundamentally defined as an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. It acts as a programmatic way for a computer program to request a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on.
Provide examples of functions or services that a user-level process can request from the kernel level via a system call.,"A user-level process can request various functions or services from the kernel level via a system call, including **Process control**, **File management**, and **Device management**. These categories encompass operations like creating/terminating processes, reading/writing files, and interacting with hardware devices."
Describe the 'System call table' and its role in issuing a system call.,"The **System call table** is a table of pointers located in the kernel region. Its role in issuing a system call is to map system call numbers to the addresses of different system call functions. When a user process makes a system call, it provides an index that corresponds to an entry in this table, allowing the kernel to locate and execute the correct function."
How does a user process typically pass parameters when issuing a system call using an API?,"When issuing a system call, a user process typically passes the index of the system call and its parameters using an API similar to `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`. Here, `SYS_call` would be the index identifying the specific system call function, and `arg1, arg2, ...` would be the arguments required by that function."
Define what a 'Rootkit' is.,"A **Rootkit** is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. **Root privileges** refer to the highest level of access and control over an operating system, typically associated with the 'root' user or administrator account."
What are the capabilities of a 'Root user' that a rootkit exploits?,"A **Root user** does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions to the system. A rootkit exploits these capabilities by gaining root privileges, allowing it to operate with unrestricted access and control over the compromised computer."
Describe two primary actions a rootkit can perform once it has obtained root privileges.,"Once a rootkit has obtained root privileges, it can perform two primary actions: \n\n1.  **Insert and execute arbitrary malicious code** in the system's code path.\n2.  **Hide its existence**, for example, by concealing malicious processes, files, or network sockets from being detected by system monitoring tools."
How can an attacker gain root privileges to deploy a rootkit?,"An attacker can gain root privileges to deploy a rootkit by exploiting **vulnerabilities in the software stack**. Examples of such vulnerabilities include **buffer overflow** and **format string** vulnerabilities. A **buffer overflow** occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-length buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to arbitrary code execution. A **format string vulnerability** arises when an attacker can supply the format string argument to a function like `printf`, leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution."
"What is a 'buffer overflow' vulnerability, and how can it be used to gain root privileges?","A **buffer overflow** is a vulnerability in the software stack where a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-length buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially corrupting data or executing arbitrary code. Attackers can exploit this to inject malicious code or alter program flow, which, if executed with elevated privileges, can lead to gaining root privileges."
"What is a 'format string' vulnerability, and how can it be used to gain root privileges?","A **format string vulnerability** arises when an attacker can supply the format string argument to a function that expects a user-controlled string, such as `printf`. This can lead to various exploits, including reading or writing arbitrary memory locations, which can be leveraged to gain root privileges by manipulating program execution or data structures in memory."
