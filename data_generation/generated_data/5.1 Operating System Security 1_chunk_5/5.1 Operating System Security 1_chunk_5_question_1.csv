What types of data does the OS collect for monitoring?,"The Operating System (OS) collects various types of data at different layers for monitoring. These include System call traces, Log files, File integrity checksums, Registry access, Kernel and driver-level monitoring, Resource usage, and Network activities."
"Define ""System call traces"" as a type of monitored data.",System call traces are a type of monitored data that describe the activities or behaviors of processes running within the system. These traces provide insights into how processes interact with the operating system's kernel.
What information is typically found in a log file for monitoring purposes?,"A log file typically contains information on user activity. This includes, but is not limited to, user login records and the history of commands executed by users. This data is crucial for auditing and security monitoring."
"Explain the purpose of ""File integrity checksums"" in data monitoring.","File integrity checksums are used in data monitoring to periodically scan critical files for changes. They compare cryptographic checksums for these files against a record of known good values. A cryptographic checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from a larger block of data, used to detect accidental errors or malicious alterations to data."
"What is ""Registry access"" monitoring, and to which operating systems is it specific?",Registry access monitoring involves observing and recording attempts to access the system's registry. The registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry. This type of monitoring is specific to Windows operating systems.
"What kind of insight does ""Kernel and driver-level monitoring"" provide?",Kernel and driver-level monitoring provides insight into Operating System (OS) kernel-level anomalies. The kernel is the core part of an operating system that manages system resources and allows computer programs to interact with the hardware. Drivers are software components that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices. Monitoring these levels helps detect unusual or malicious activities that occur at a fundamental system level.
"How can ""Resource usage"" data indicate malicious behaviors?","Resource usage data, which includes CPU, memory, or I/O utilization and activities, can indicate the execution of some malicious behaviors. Unusual spikes or patterns in resource consumption might suggest that unauthorized or harmful processes are running on the system, consuming resources beyond normal operational parameters."
"What do ""Network activities"" include as monitored data?","Network activities, as a form of monitored data, include established connections and received packets. Monitoring these activities helps in understanding network traffic patterns, identifying unauthorized communications, or detecting data exfiltration attempts."
What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system used to detect unauthorized intrusions into computer systems. An intrusion refers to any unauthorized activity on a computer network or system, such as attempts to gain access, compromise data, or disrupt services."
How can an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) be implemented at different layers?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be implemented at different layers within a computer environment. These implementations include network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitors network traffic, and host-based IDS (HIDS), which monitors individual hosts or devices."
What is the primary focus of a host-based IDS?,"The primary focus of a host-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is to monitor the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. This involves examining system logs, file integrity, running processes, and other host-specific data to detect potential intrusions."
What are the three logical components that comprise an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?,"An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comprises three logical components: Sensors, Analyzers, and a User interface. Each component plays a distinct role in the overall functionality of the IDS."
"What is the role of ""Sensors"" in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?","In an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Sensors are responsible for collecting data. This data can include network traffic, system logs, file changes, and other relevant information from the monitored environment, which is then passed on for analysis."
"Describe the function of ""Analyzers"" within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).","Analyzers within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and identifying the possible evidence. They process the data collected by the sensors, apply detection methodologies, and may also provide guidance about what actions to take as a result of the detected intrusion."
"What is the purpose of the ""User interface"" component in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?","The User interface component in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) enables a user to view output from the system, such as alerts and reports of detected intrusions. It also allows the user to control the behavior of the system, configuring its settings and responses."
"What is ""Signature-based detection"" in the context of intrusion detection methodologies?","Signature-based detection is an intrusion detection methodology that flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. It relies on a database of predefined attack patterns, or signatures, to identify malicious behavior. A signature is a specific pattern or sequence of bytes that indicates a known threat."
"Explain the concept of ""blacklisting"" as it applies to signature-based detection.","In signature-based detection, ""blacklisting"" refers to maintaining a list of patterns that are explicitly not allowed. If the system detects any activity or data that matches an entry on this blacklist, it generates an alert, indicating a potential intrusion or malicious activity. This approach is effective against known threats."
What is an advantage of using signature-based detection?,"An advantage of using signature-based detection is that it is simple and easy to build. Furthermore, it is very good at accurately detecting known attacks because it relies on specific, predefined patterns or signatures of those attacks."
What is a disadvantage of signature-based detection?,"A significant disadvantage of signature-based detection is its inability to catch new attacks without a known signature. Since it relies on a database of predefined attack patterns, it cannot identify novel or zero-day attacks for which no signature yet exists."
"What is ""Anomaly-based detection"" in the context of intrusion detection methodologies?","Anomaly-based detection is an intrusion detection methodology that involves developing a model of what normal activities look like within a system or network. It then alerts on any activities that deviate significantly from these established normal activities, indicating a potential intrusion. Anomaly refers to a deviation from what is standard, normal, or expected."
"Explain the concept of ""whitelisting"" as it applies to anomaly-based detection.","In anomaly-based detection, ""whitelisting"" refers to maintaining a list of allowed patterns or behaviors. The system then alerts if it observes something that is not on this list. This approach assumes that anything not explicitly permitted is suspicious, making it effective at detecting novel or previously unseen attacks."
What is an advantage of using anomaly-based detection?,"An advantage of using anomaly-based detection is its ability to detect attacks that have not been seen before. By identifying deviations from normal behavior rather than matching known signatures, it can potentially identify novel or zero-day threats."
What is a disadvantage of anomaly-based detection?,"A disadvantage of anomaly-based detection is that its false positive rate can be high. This means it may frequently flag many non-malicious activities as unusual, leading to alerts for events that are not actual attacks. A false positive is an error in which a system incorrectly identifies a normal event as an anomaly or threat."
What are the Security Protection Stages in an Operating System (OS)?,"The Security Protection Stages in an Operating System (OS) include Authentication, Authorization with Access Control, and Logging, Monitoring & Auditing."
"What is the highest privilege operating mode in an OS, and what is its function?","The highest privilege operating mode in an Operating System (OS) is Kernel mode. In this mode, the system runs critical functions and services, having unrestricted access to all hardware and memory. This high level of privilege is necessary for the OS to manage system resources effectively and securely."
What is the least privilege operating mode in an OS?,"The least privilege operating mode in an Operating System (OS) is user mode. In this mode, applications and most user programs run with restricted access to system resources and hardware, relying on the kernel to perform privileged operations on their behalf."
Can entities in higher privilege rings directly access objects in lower rings?,"No, entities operating in higher privilege rings cannot directly call the functions and access the objects in the lower rings. This architectural design enforces security and prevents unauthorized access to critical system resources."
What is required for entities in higher privilege rings to interact with functions or objects in lower rings?,"For entities in higher privilege rings to interact with functions or objects in lower rings, a context switch is required. This procedure is necessary for operations such as system calls and interrupts, allowing controlled transitions between privilege levels."
What is the purpose of a status flag in the context of OS operating modes?,"In the context of OS operating modes, a status flag allows the system to work in different modes. This flag is a register or memory location that stores information about the current state of the CPU, including its operating mode (e.g., kernel mode or user mode)."
Describe the privilege levels of Ring 0 and Ring 3 in the context of OS privileged rings.,"In the context of OS privileged rings, Ring 0 represents the Kernel and has the most privileged access. Ring 3 represents Applications and has the least privileged access. The rings in between, Ring 1 and Ring 2, are typically used for device drivers, with Ring 0 being the innermost and most trusted layer."
What are the different events that can trigger a transition from user to kernel levels?,"Different events can trigger a transition from user to kernel levels. These include a System call, a Trap, and a Hardware interrupt. Each of these events signals a need for the kernel to perform privileged operations or handle an exceptional situation."
"Define ""System call"" as an event that triggers a transition from user to kernel levels.","A System call, as an event triggering a transition from user to kernel levels, occurs when a user application explicitly makes a request to the kernel for privileged operations. These operations might include accessing hardware, creating processes, or managing files, which user applications are not permitted to do directly."
"What is a ""Trap"" in the context of user-to-kernel level transitions?","A ""Trap"" in the context of user-to-kernel level transitions occurs when a user application encounters an exceptional event or error and requests the kernel to handle it. This could be due to an illegal instruction, a division by zero, or an attempt to access protected memory, requiring the kernel's intervention."
Are system calls and traps considered software or hardware interrupts?,"System calls and traps are both considered software interrupts. A software interrupt is an interrupt generated by a software instruction, typically used to request a service from the operating system kernel or to handle an exceptional condition within a program."
"What is a ""Hardware interrupt"" and what does it indicate to the CPU?","A ""Hardware interrupt"" is an event where a hardware device issues a signal to the CPU. This signal indicates that an event needs immediate attention, such as data being ready from a disk drive, a key press, or a network packet arrival. The CPU then pauses its current task to handle the interrupt."
Describe the first step in the CPU's switch procedure during a user-to-kernel transition.,"The first step in the CPU's switch procedure during a user-to-kernel transition is for the CPU to store the process's states. Following this, it switches to the kernel mode by setting the status flag. Storing the process's states ensures that the user-mode program can resume correctly after the kernel operation is complete."
How does the Kernel handle an interrupt during the switch procedure?,"During the switch procedure, the Kernel handles the interrupt based on the interrupt vector found in an interrupt table. The interrupt vector is an entry in a table that contains the memory address of the specific interrupt handler routine designed to process that particular type of interrupt."
What is the final step the CPU takes after handling an interrupt in the switch procedure?,"After handling an interrupt in the switch procedure, the final step the CPU takes is to switch back to user mode and restore the previously stored states of the process. This allows the user application to continue its execution from where it left off before the interrupt occurred."
What is a system call?,A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services from the kernel level. It acts as a programmatic way for a computer program to request a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on.
List some categories of functions or services that a user-level process can request from the kernel level via a system call.,"A user-level process can request various categories of functions or services from the kernel level via a system call. These categories include Process control, File management, and Device management. Examples of specific system calls might be `sys_fork` for process control, `sys_read` for file management, and `sys_open` for device management."
"What is a ""system call table"" and where is it located?","A ""system call table"" is a table of pointers to different system call functions. It is located in the kernel region of memory. When a user process makes a system call, the operating system uses this table to find and execute the appropriate kernel function."
How does a user process issue a system call using an API?,"A user process issues a system call using an API by passing the index of the desired system call along with any necessary parameters. This is typically done through a function like `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`, where `SYS_call` is the identifier for the specific system call, and `arg1`, `arg2`, etc., are its arguments."
What is a Rootkit?,"A Rootkit is a type of malware that obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. Root privileges refer to the highest level of access and control over an operating system, allowing the malware to perform virtually any action without restriction."
What kind of actions can a root user perform in a compromised system?,"In a compromised system, a root user, which a rootkit aims to become, does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions to the system. This includes inserting and executing arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path and hiding its existence."
How can a rootkit hide its existence in a compromised system?,"A rootkit can hide its existence in a compromised system by concealing malicious processes, files, and network sockets from being detected. This allows the rootkit to operate covertly, making it difficult for security software or administrators to identify its presence."
What are some ways an attacker can gain root privileges to install a rootkit?,"An attacker can gain root privileges to install a rootkit by exploiting vulnerabilities in the software stack. Examples of such vulnerabilities include buffer overflows and format string bugs, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges."
What is the role of cryptographic checksums in file integrity checksums?,"In file integrity checksums, cryptographic checksums play a crucial role by being compared against a record of known good values. This comparison helps detect any unauthorized changes or tampering with critical files. A cryptographic checksum is a hash value generated from a file's content, designed to be highly sensitive to any modifications, ensuring that even a small change results in a different checksum."
Which type of IDS focuses on monitoring a single host for suspicious activities?,"A host-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) focuses on monitoring the characteristics of a single host for suspicious activities. This contrasts with network-based IDSs, which monitor network traffic across multiple hosts."
What is the primary difference between blacklisting and whitelisting in detection methodologies?,"The primary difference between blacklisting and whitelisting in detection methodologies lies in their approach to identifying threats. Blacklisting involves keeping a list of patterns that are *not allowed* and alerting if something on that list is seen. Whitelisting, conversely, keeps a list of *allowed* patterns and alerts if something *not* on that list is seen. Blacklisting focuses on known bad, while whitelisting focuses on known good."
What is the relationship between kernel mode and user mode privileges?,"The relationship between kernel mode and user mode privileges is hierarchical: kernel mode has the highest privilege, running critical functions and services with unrestricted access to system resources, while user mode has the least privilege, running applications with restricted access. This design ensures system stability and security by preventing user applications from directly accessing or corrupting critical OS components."
