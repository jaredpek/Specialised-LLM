What are the differences between file integrity checksums and registry access monitoring?,"File integrity checksums involve periodically scanning critical files for changes and comparing cryptographic checksums for these files with a record of known good values. Registry access monitoring, specific to Windows operating systems, focuses on monitoring access to the registry."

Compare the function of analyzers with the user interface in an IDS.,"Analyzers in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are responsible for determining if an intrusion has occurred and the possible evidence, potentially offering guidance on actions to take. The user interface, conversely, enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system."
What are the differences between sensors and the user interface in an Intrusion Detection System?,"Sensors in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are responsible for collecting data. The user interface, in contrast, enables a user to view output from the system or control the behavior of the system."
Compare signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection.,"Signature-based detection flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. Anomaly-based detection, however, develops a model of what normal activities look like and alerts on any activities that deviate from normal activities."
What are the differences between blacklisting and whitelisting in detection methodologies?,"Blacklisting, used in signature-based detection, involves keeping a list of patterns that are not allowed and alerting if something on that list is observed. Whitelisting, used in anomaly-based detection, involves keeping a list of allowed patterns and alerting if something that is not on that list is observed."
Compare the primary advantages of signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection.,"The primary advantage of signature-based detection is that it is simple and easy to build, and good at detecting known attacks. The primary advantage of anomaly-based detection is its ability to detect attacks we have not seen before."
What are the main disadvantages of signature-based detection compared to anomaly-based detection?,"The main disadvantage of signature-based detection is that it cannot catch new attacks without a known signature. The main disadvantage of anomaly-based detection is that its false positive rate can be high, meaning many non-attacks might look unusual."
Explain the fundamental operational difference between signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection.,"Signature-based detection operates by flagging activities that match the structure of a known attack, essentially looking for 'bad' patterns. Anomaly-based detection, conversely, works by first establishing a model of 'normal' activities and then alerting on any activities that deviate from this established normal behavior."

Authentication is one stage, while Logging, Monitoring & Auditing represents a different stage focused on recording and reviewing system activities."

What are the differences between Ring 0 and Ring 3 in the context of privileged rings inside an OS?,"Ring 0 represents the Kernel, which has the most privileged access. Ring 3 represents Applications, which have the least privileged access. Entities in higher rings (like Ring 3) cannot directly call functions or access objects in lower rings (like Ring 0)."
Compare the Kernel with Applications in the context of privileged rings.,"The Kernel resides in Ring 0, which has the most privileged access, running critical functions and services. Applications reside in Ring 3, which has the least privileged access."
What are the differences in privilege between device drivers and applications in an OS?,"Device drivers typically operate in Ring 1 or Ring 2, which have higher privileges than applications. Applications operate in Ring 3, which has the least privilege. Entities in higher rings (like applications) cannot directly call functions or access objects in lower rings (like device drivers or the kernel)."
Compare how entities in higher rings interact with lower rings versus direct access.,"Entities in the higher rings cannot directly call the functions and access the objects in the lower rings. Instead, a context switch is required to achieve procedures that involve operations at different privilege levels, such as a system call or interrupt."
Compare a system call with a trap as events that trigger a transition from user to kernel levels.,"A system call is an event where a user application explicitly makes a request to the kernel for privileged operations. A trap, on the other hand, occurs when a user application encounters an exceptional event or error and requests the kernel to handle it. Both system calls and traps belong to software interrupts."
What are the differences between software interrupts and hardware interrupts?,"Software interrupts, which include system calls and traps, are triggered by user applications, either explicitly requesting privileged operations (system call) or encountering exceptional events/errors (trap). Hardware interrupts, conversely, are signals issued by hardware to the CPU, indicating that an event needs immediate attention."
Compare the nature of the request for a system call versus a trap.,"A system call is triggered by an explicit request from a user application for privileged operations. A trap, however, is triggered by an exceptional event or error encountered by a user application, which then requests the kernel to handle it."
Compare the CPU's role in storing process states during a context switch with the Kernel's role in handling the interrupt.,"During a context switch, the CPU stores the process's states and switches to the kernel mode by setting the status flag. The Kernel then handles the interrupt based on the interrupt vector in an interrupt table."

They represent different domains of operations that the kernel can perform on behalf of user applications.
Compare the system call table with the `syscall()` API in how a system call is issued.,"The system call table is a table of pointers in the kernel region, to different system call functions. The `syscall()` API, such as `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...)`, is how a user process passes the index of the system call and its parameters to initiate a system call."
Compare the role of a user-level process with the kernel level in a system call.,"A system call is an interface that allows a user-level process to request functions or services. These requested functions or services are then provided by the kernel level, which operates with higher privileges."
"Compare the privileges of a root user with those of a regular user, as implied by the document's description of rootkits.","A root user does not go through any security checks and can perform any actions to the system. This implies that a regular user would be subject to security checks and have restricted permissions, unlike the unrestricted capabilities of a root user."
What are the differences between a rootkit's ability to insert/execute malicious code and its ability to hide its existence?,"A rootkit obtains root privileges to compromise a computer. One of its abilities is to insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path. Another distinct ability is to hide its existence, for example, by concealing malicious processes, files, or network sockets from being detected."
Compare buffer overflow with format string vulnerabilities as methods for an attacker to gain root privileges.,Buffer overflow and format string are both examples of vulnerabilities in the software stack that attackers can exploit to gain root privileges. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to compromise the computer and obtain the elevated permissions of a root user.
