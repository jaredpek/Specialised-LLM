Provide a comprehensive summary of the key events related to the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,The public announcement regarding the SingHealth Cyber Breach was made on 20 July 2018. Patient outreach and communications began immediately after the announcement. SMS messages were utilized as the primary method for disseminating information quickly to a large audience. A Committee of Inquiry (COI) was established and identified 5 key findings.
Summarize the first key finding of the COI Committee regarding IHiS staff.,"The first key finding of the COI Committee is that IHiS (Integrated Health Information Systems) staff lacked adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This deficiency prevented them from fully appreciating the security implications of their findings and from responding effectively to the attack."
Explain the second key finding of the COI Committee concerning IHiS staff actions.,"The second key finding of the COI Committee states that certain IHiS staff members, who held critical roles in IT security incident response and reporting, failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action. This inaction resulted in missed opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltrating of data during the attack."
Detail the third key finding of the COI Committee regarding vulnerabilities in the SingHealth network.,"The third key finding of the COI Committee identified a number of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations within the SingHealth network and its SCM (SingHealth Centralized Management) system. These issues contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data. Many of these issues could have been resolved prior to the attack."
Describe the fourth key finding of the COI Committee regarding the nature of the attacker.,"The fourth key finding of the COI Committee characterizes the attacker as a skilled and sophisticated actor, exhibiting the traits of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group."
Elaborate on Key Finding #4-1 concerning the attacker's goals and methods.,"Key Finding #4-1 details that the attacker had a specific objective: to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of specific individuals (PM) and other patients. The attacker employed advanced TTPs, which stands for tools/tactics, techniques, and procedures. This was evidenced by the use of advanced, customized, and stealthy malware, subtle movements within the network, and the ability to identify and exploit various vulnerabilities in SingHealth's IT network and the SCM application."
Explain Key Finding #4-2 regarding the attacker's persistence and resources.,"Key Finding #4-2 highlights the attacker's persistence. They established multiple footholds and backdoors, conducted their attack over a period exceeding 10 months, and made numerous attempts to access the SCM database using various methods. Furthermore, the attacker was identified as a well-resourced group, possessing an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and a broad range of technical expertise."
Summarize the fifth key finding of the COI Committee regarding cyber defenses.,"The fifth key finding of the COI Committee posits that while cyber defenses can never be completely impregnable, and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching network perimeters can be challenging, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not an unavoidable outcome."
