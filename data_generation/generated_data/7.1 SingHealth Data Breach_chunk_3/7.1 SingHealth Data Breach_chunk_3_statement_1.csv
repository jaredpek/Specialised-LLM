How many key findings were identified by the COI Committee?,The COI Committee identified 5 key findings.
Describe Key Finding 1 regarding IHiS staff.,"Key Finding 1 states that IHiS staff did not have adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This deficiency prevented them from appreciating the security implications of their findings and from responding effectively to the attack."
What was the issue with certain IHiS staff in Key Finding 2?,"Key Finding 2 highlights that certain IHiS staff holding key roles in IT security incident response and reporting failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action. This failure resulted in missed opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltrating of data during the attack."
What were the contributing factors to the attacker's success in Key Finding 3?,"Key Finding 3 indicates that there were a number of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations in the SingHealth network and SCM system. These issues contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data, and many of them could have been remedied before the attack."
What characteristics did the attacker exhibit in Key Finding 4?,Key Finding 4 describes the attacker as a skilled and sophisticated actor bearing the characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat group.
What was the attacker's clear goal as stated in Key Finding #4-1?,"The attacker had a clear goal in mind, which was to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of PM and other patients."
"What advanced TTPs did the attacker employ, according to Key Finding #4-1?","The attacker employed advanced TTPs (tools/tactics, techniques, procedures). This was evidenced by the use of advanced, customized, and stealthy malware, generally stealthy movements, and the ability to find and exploit various vulnerabilities in SingHealth's IT network and the SCM application."
"How was the attacker persistent, as described in Key Finding #4-2?","The attacker was persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. They carried out their attack over a period of more than 10 months and made multiple attempts to access the SCM database using various methods."
"What made the attacker a well-resourced group, according to Key Finding #4-2?","The attacker was a well-resourced group, possessing an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
"What is the implication of cyber defenses against Advanced Persistent Threats, according to Key Finding 5?","Key Finding 5 states that while cyber defenses will never be impregnable and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the network perimeter may be difficult, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable."
Define 'vulnerabilities' in the context of cybersecurity.,Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a system that can be exploited by an attacker.
Define 'weaknesses' as they relate to cybersecurity.,"Weaknesses, in a cybersecurity context, refer to deficiencies or shortcomings in security controls or practices that could be exploited."
What are 'misconfigurations' in a network system?,Misconfigurations are incorrect settings or arrangements of software or hardware components that can create security gaps.
Explain what 'exfiltrating data' means.,Exfiltrating data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network to an external location.
What is an 'Advanced Persistent Threat' (APT) group?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is a sophisticated and skilled actor that targets specific entities with the intent to gain unauthorized access and maintain prolonged presence within the victim's network, often for espionage or data theft."
Define 'TTPs' in the context of cybersecurity attacks.,"TTPs stands for Tools, Tactics, and Procedures. These are the methods and techniques that attackers use to carry out their operations."
What does 'malware' refer to in cybersecurity?,"Malware is a type of software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Examples include viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware."
Explain the concept of 'stealthy movements' by an attacker.,Stealthy movements by an attacker refer to actions taken within a network that are designed to avoid detection by security systems and personnel.
What is meant by 'footholds' and 'backdoors' established by an attacker?,"Footholds and backdoors are methods used by attackers to gain and maintain access to a compromised system or network. A foothold is an initial point of entry, while a backdoor is a hidden method of access that bypasses normal authentication procedures."
What is a 'command and control network' in the context of cyberattacks?,A command and control (C2) network is a system used by attackers to communicate with and control compromised machines (bots) within a victim's network.
What does it mean for cyber defenses to be 'impregnable'?,Cyber defenses being 'impregnable' means they are completely secure and cannot be breached by any attack.
What is the 'perimeter of the network' in cybersecurity?,"The perimeter of the network refers to the boundary between a private, internal network and an external network, such as the internet. It is the first line of defense against external threats."
What was the date of the public announcement and when did patient outreach begin?,"The public announcement was made on 20 July 2018, and patient outreach and communications commenced immediately thereafter."
"What was the primary communication method used, and why?",SMS messages were used as the primary mode of communication due to the need for quick dissemination of information on a large scale.
