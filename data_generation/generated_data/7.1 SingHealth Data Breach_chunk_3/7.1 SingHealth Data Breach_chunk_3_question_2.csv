Can cyber defences be completely impregnable?,"According to Key Finding 5, cyber defences will never be completely impregnable."
Was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable?,"No, according to Key Finding 5, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable, even though it can be difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching a network perimeter."
What is IHiS?,"IHiS refers to Integrated Health Information Systems, an entity whose staff's cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources are discussed in Key Finding 1."
What is the SCM system mentioned in the document?,"The SCM system is a system within SingHealth that was subject to vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations, and was targeted by the attacker for data exfiltration. It is also mentioned as a database the attacker attempted to access."
What does 'exfiltrating data' mean in the context of a cyber attack?,"Exfiltrating data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer or network. In the context of a cyber attack, it means the attacker successfully stole and removed sensitive information."
What is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is a sophisticated and skilled actor characterized by their ability to maintain long-term, undetected access to a network. They typically have significant resources and technical expertise to achieve their objectives, which often involve espionage or data theft."
