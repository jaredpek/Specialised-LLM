Provide a comprehensive summary of the key events related to the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"The public announcement regarding the SingHealth Cyber Breach was made on July 20, 2018. Patient outreach and communications began immediately after the announcement. SMS messages were utilized as the primary method for disseminating information quickly to a large audience. A Committee of Inquiry (COI) identified 5 key findings related to the breach."
Summarize the first key finding of the COI Committee regarding the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"The first key finding of the COI Committee is that IHiS (Integrated Health Information Systems) staff lacked adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This deficiency prevented them from fully appreciating the security implications of their findings and from effectively responding to the attack."
Explain the second key finding of the COI Committee concerning the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"The second key finding highlights that certain IHiS staff members, who held critical roles in IT security incident response and reporting, failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action. This inaction resulted in missed opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltrating of data during the attack."
Detail the third key finding of the COI Committee regarding vulnerabilities in the SingHealth network.,"The third key finding states that there were numerous vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations within the SingHealth network and its SCM (SingHealth Cyber Management) system. These issues contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data. Many of these issues could have been rectified before the attack occurred."
Describe the fourth key finding of the COI Committee about the nature of the attacker in the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"The fourth key finding characterizes the attacker as a skilled and sophisticated actor exhibiting the traits of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. An Advanced Persistent Threat is a type of cyberattack where an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period, with the intent to steal data or disrupt systems."
Elaborate on Key Finding #4-1 concerning the attacker's goals and methods in the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"Key Finding #4-1 details that the attacker had a specific objective: to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of Prime Minister (PM) and other patients. The attacker employed advanced TTPs (tools/tactics, techniques, procedures), utilizing a suite of sophisticated, customized, and stealthy malware. Their movements were generally covert, and they demonstrated an ability to identify and exploit various vulnerabilities within SingHealth's IT network and the SCM application."
Explain Key Finding #4-2 regarding the attacker's persistence and resources in the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"Key Finding #4-2 reveals that the attacker was persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. The attack spanned over 10 months, during which multiple attempts were made to access the SCM database using various methods. Furthermore, the attacker was identified as a well-resourced group, possessing an extensive command and control network, the capacity to develop numerous customized tools, and a broad spectrum of technical expertise."
Summarize the fifth key finding of the COI Committee regarding the inevitability of the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"The fifth key finding posits that while cyber defenses can never be completely impregnable, and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching network perimeters can be challenging, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not an inevitable outcome. This implies that there were opportunities to prevent or mitigate the breach that were not fully realized."
