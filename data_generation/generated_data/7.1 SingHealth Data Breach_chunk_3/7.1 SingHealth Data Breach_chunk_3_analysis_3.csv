"Define 'vulnerabilities', 'weaknesses', and 'misconfigurations' as they relate to the SingHealth network.",In the context of the SingHealth network: 'Vulnerabilities' are flaws or weaknesses that can be exploited by an attacker. 'Weaknesses' are less severe flaws or deficiencies. 'Misconfigurations' are errors in the setup or settings of systems that can create security risks.
"How did vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations contribute to the attacker's success?","These vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations in the SingHealth network and SCM system provided openings that the attacker exploited, contributing directly to their success in obtaining and exfiltrating data."
What is the implication of 'many of which could have been remedied before the attack'?,"This phrase implies that a significant number of the identified vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations were preventable or fixable before the attack occurred, suggesting a failure in proactive security measures."
What are the defining characteristics of the attacker identified as an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is characterized by being skilled and sophisticated. This implies advanced capabilities, a persistent approach to achieving objectives, and often state-sponsored or highly organized malicious intent."
