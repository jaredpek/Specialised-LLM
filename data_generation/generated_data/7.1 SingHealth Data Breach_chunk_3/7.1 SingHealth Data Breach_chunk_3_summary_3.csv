Summarize the key events and findings related to the SingHealth Cyber Breach.,"The public announcement regarding the SingHealth Cyber Breach was made on July 20, 2018, with immediate patient outreach and communications following. SMS messages were the primary communication method for rapid, large-scale information dissemination. A Committee of Inquiry (COI) identified five key findings:

Key Finding 1: IHiS (Integrated Health Information Systems) staff lacked adequate cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources to understand the security implications of their findings and to effectively respond to the attack.

Key Finding 2: Certain IHiS staff in critical IT security incident response and reporting roles failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action, missing opportunities to prevent data theft and exfiltration.

Key Finding 3: Vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations existed within the SingHealth network and the SCM (SingHealth Clinical Management) system, contributing to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data. Many of these issues could have been resolved before the attack.

Key Finding 4: The attacker was a skilled and sophisticated actor, exhibiting characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. This involved having a clear goal (personal and outpatient medication data), employing advanced tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with stealthy malware and movements, exploiting vulnerabilities, establishing multiple footholds and backdoors over 10 months, and possessing extensive resources, a command and control network, customized tools, and broad technical expertise.

Key Finding 5: While cyber defenses may not be impregnable and preventing an APT breach can be difficult, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable, implying that certain actions or defenses could have mitigated the outcome."
