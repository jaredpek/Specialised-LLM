Following this, patient outreach and communications commenced immediately. SMS messages were utilized as the primary method for communication to ensure rapid dissemination of information on a large scale."
What did the COI Committee identify regarding the SingHealth Cyber Breach?,The COI Committee identified 5 key Findings related to the SingHealth Cyber Breach.
Describe the first key finding regarding IHiS staff.,"The first key finding is that IHiS staff lacked adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This deficiency prevented them from fully appreciating the security implications of their findings and from responding effectively to the attack."
What was the issue with certain IHiS staff in Key Finding 2?,"Key Finding 2 states that certain IHiS staff, who held critical roles in IT security incident response and reporting, failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action. This inaction resulted in missed opportunities to prevent the theft and exfiltration of data during the attack."
What vulnerabilities were present in the SingHealth network according to Key Finding 3?,"Key Finding 3 highlights that there were numerous vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations within the SingHealth network and the SCM system. These issues contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data, and many of them could have been fixed before the attack occurred."
"What characteristics did the attacker possess, as identified in Key Finding 4?","According to Key Finding 4, the attacker was a skilled and sophisticated actor exhibiting the characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat group."
"What was the attacker's goal and what methods did they use, as detailed in Key Finding #4-1?","In Key Finding #4-1, it is stated that the attacker had a clear objective: to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of PM and other patients. The attacker employed advanced TTPs (tools/tactics, techniques, procedures), utilizing a suite of advanced, customized, and stealthy malware. They also demonstrated stealthy movements and had the capability to find and exploit various vulnerabilities within SingHealth's IT network and the SCM application."
"How persistent was the attacker and what resources did they have, according to Key Finding #4-2?","Key Finding #4-2 describes the attacker as persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. The attack spanned over 10 months, during which multiple attempts were made to access the SCM database using various methods. Furthermore, the attacker was a well-resourced group, possessing an extensive command and control network, the ability to develop numerous customized tools, and a broad range of technical expertise."
"Was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable, based on Key Finding 5?","Key Finding 5 clarifies that while cyber defenses may never be completely impregnable and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching a network perimeter can be challenging, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating the data was not inevitable."
Compare the public announcement date with the commencement of patient outreach.,"The public announcement was made on July 20, 2018. Patient outreach and communications began immediately after this announcement."
What was the primary communication method used and why?,SMS messages were the primary mode of communication. This method was chosen due to the need for quick dissemination of information on a large scale.
What is the significance of '5 key Findings' mentioned in the summary?,The mention of '5 key Findings' indicates that the COI Committee has identified and documented five crucial points or conclusions related to the event being discussed.
"Explain the deficiency in cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources for IHiS staff.","IHiS staff did not possess adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This lack meant they were unable to fully grasp the security implications of their findings and were not equipped to respond effectively to the attack."
What were the consequences of certain IHiS staff failing to act appropriately?,"When certain IHiS staff in key IT security roles failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action, opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltration of data during the attack were missed."
"Define 'vulnerabilities', 'weaknesses', and 'misconfigurations' in the context of Key Finding 3.","In Key Finding 3, 'vulnerabilities' refer to flaws or weaknesses in the SingHealth network and SCM system that could be exploited. 'Weaknesses' are similar, indicating areas of reduced security. 'Misconfigurations' are settings or setups within the network or system that were not correctly implemented, thereby creating security gaps. These collectively contributed to the attacker's success."
What does it mean for an attacker to be a 'skilled and sophisticated actor' with 'Advanced Persistent Threat group' characteristics?,"An attacker described as a 'skilled and sophisticated actor' with 'Advanced Persistent Threat group' characteristics implies a high level of technical proficiency, strategic planning, and the ability to conduct prolonged and complex cyberattacks. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are known for their ability to remain undetected within a network for extended periods, systematically compromising systems and exfiltrating data."
"What are TTPs, and how did the attacker employ them?","TTPs stand for tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures. The attacker employed advanced TTPs by using a suite of sophisticated, customized, and stealthy malware. Their movements within the network were generally stealthy, and they demonstrated an ability to identify and exploit various vulnerabilities in SingHealth's IT network and the SCM application."
Explain the concept of 'multiple footholds and backdoors' established by the attacker.,"'Multiple footholds and backdoors' refer to the attacker establishing several points of entry and hidden access routes within the SingHealth network. A 'foothold' is an initial point of compromise, while a 'backdoor' is a hidden method of access that bypasses normal security authentication, allowing the attacker to re-enter the system easily and maintain persistence."
What does it mean for the attacker to be 'well-resourced'?,"Being 'well-resourced' indicates that the attacker group had significant advantages, including an extensive command and control network for managing their operations, the capability to develop numerous customized tools tailored to their objectives, and a wide range of technical expertise to execute their attack effectively."
Contrast 'impregnable' cyber defenses with the reality described in Key Finding 5.,"Key Finding 5 states that cyber defenses will 'never be impregnable,' meaning they cannot be made completely impenetrable to all threats. The reality described is that while it is difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching a network, the success of such an attack is not a foregone conclusion and can be mitigated."
What was the attacker's clear goal in mind?,The attacker's clear goal was to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of PM (presumably a patient or group of patients) and other patients.
Describe the nature of the malware used by the attacker.,"The attacker used a suite of malware that was advanced, customized, and stealthy. This indicates a high level of sophistication in the tools employed for the attack."
How long did the attacker's persistence last?,The attacker was persistent and carried out their attack over a period of more than 10 months.
What methods did the attacker use to access the SCM database?,The attacker made multiple attempts to access the SCM database using various methods.
What capabilities did the attacker possess as a well-resourced group?,"As a well-resourced group, the attacker possessed an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customized tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
What is the implication of cyber defenses never being 'impregnable'?,"The implication is that no matter how robust security measures are, there is always a possibility of a breach, especially against sophisticated adversaries. Therefore, continuous vigilance and adaptation are necessary."
What is the difference between a public announcement and patient outreach?,"A public announcement is a general notification made to a broad audience, often to inform them of an event or situation. Patient outreach, on the other hand, is a more targeted effort to communicate directly with individuals who are affected or involved, in this case, patients."
Why was SMS chosen as the primary communication method?,"SMS was chosen as the primary communication method because it allows for the quick dissemination of information to a large number of people simultaneously, which was a critical requirement in this situation."
What does 'commenced immediately thereafter' mean in the context of the announcement?,"'Commenced immediately thereafter' means that the patient outreach and communications started right after the public announcement was made, with no significant delay."
What is the role of a COI Committee?,"A COI Committee, likely standing for Committee of Inquiry, is typically formed to investigate incidents, gather facts, and identify findings or recommendations related to a specific event or issue."
"What are the implications of 'adequate levels' of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources?","Having 'adequate levels' means possessing sufficient cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. The absence of these adequate levels, as noted in Key Finding 1, leads to an inability to understand security risks and respond effectively to threats."
What are the 'security implications' that IHiS staff failed to appreciate?,"The 'security implications' refer to the potential negative consequences and risks associated with security vulnerabilities or breaches. In this context, IHiS staff failed to fully understand how these issues could impact the system and data."
What does it mean to 'respond effectively to the attack'?,"To 'respond effectively to the attack' means to take the correct, timely, and appropriate measures to mitigate the damage, neutralize the threat, and recover from the incident. The lack of adequate training and resources hindered this capability for IHiS staff."
"What are the differences between 'appropriate', 'effective', and 'timely' action in IT security incident response?","'Appropriate' action refers to measures that are suitable for the specific situation. 'Effective' action means actions that successfully achieve the desired outcome, such as stopping the attack or minimizing damage. 'Timely' action means performing these actions without undue delay. Key Finding 2 indicates a failure in one or more of these aspects by certain IHiS staff."
What is 'exfiltrating of data'?,'Exfiltrating of data' refers to the unauthorized and covert transfer of sensitive information from a computer system or network to an external location controlled by an attacker.
What is the SCM system mentioned in Key Finding 3?,"The SCM system, as mentioned in Key Finding 3, is a specific system within SingHealth's network that contained vulnerabilities and weaknesses contributing to the data breach. Its exact function is not detailed, but it was a target for the attacker."
What does it mean for vulnerabilities to be 'remedied'?,"For vulnerabilities to be 'remedied' means that they have been fixed, corrected, or mitigated. Key Finding 3 suggests that many of the security flaws could have been addressed before the attack occurred, thus preventing or reducing the attacker's success."
What is an 'actor' in the context of cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, an 'actor' refers to an individual, group, or entity that performs actions within the digital realm, particularly those related to security threats or defense. In this case, the attacker is the threat actor."
What are the defining characteristics of an 'Advanced Persistent Threat' (APT) group?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is characterized by its sophisticated capabilities, long-term objectives, and persistent efforts to infiltrate and maintain access within targeted networks. They often use advanced tools and techniques, operate with stealth, and aim for significant data theft or disruption."
"What is the difference between 'tools/tactics, techniques, procedures' (TTPs) and malware?","TTPs (tools/tactics, techniques, procedures) represent the broader methodology an attacker uses, encompassing the specific software (malware), the strategies employed, the methods used to execute those strategies, and the step-by-step processes followed. Malware is a type of tool used within these TTPs."
Explain 'customised malware' used by the attacker.,'Customised malware' refers to malicious software that has been specifically designed or modified for a particular target or attack. This indicates a higher level of effort and tailoring by the attacker compared to using off-the-shelf malware.
What does 'stealthy movements' imply about the attacker's actions?,'Stealthy movements' imply that the attacker operated within the network in a way that avoided detection by security systems and personnel. This suggests a deliberate effort to remain hidden while carrying out their objectives.
What is a 'command and control network'?,A 'command and control network' (often abbreviated as C2 or C&C) is the infrastructure used by attackers to remotely communicate with and control compromised systems or malware within a victim's network. It's essential for directing the attack and receiving stolen data.
What is the significance of the attacker having 'technical expertise'?,"Having 'technical expertise' means the attacker possesses a deep understanding of computer systems, networks, security protocols, and exploitation techniques. This allows them to effectively plan, execute, and adapt their attacks."
What does it mean for the attacker's success to be 'not inevitable'?,"The statement 'not inevitable' means that the attacker's success was not guaranteed or predetermined. It implies that with better defenses, quicker responses, or remediation of vulnerabilities, the outcome could have been different, and the data breach might have been prevented or its impact lessened."
