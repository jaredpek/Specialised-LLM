What is Key Finding 5 regarding cyber defenses and the attack's inevitability?,"Key Finding 5 posits that while cyber defenses can never be completely impregnable and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching a network perimeter can be difficult, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable."
Are cyber defenses completely impregnable?,"No, according to Key Finding 5, cyber defenses will never be completely impregnable."
Is it always possible to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching a network?,Key Finding 5 suggests that it may be difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the perimeter of a network.

What does the document say about the public announcement date?,"The public announcement was made on July 20, 2018."
What actions commenced immediately after the public announcement?,Patient outreach and communications commenced immediately after the public announcement.
What was the role of SMS messages in the communication strategy?,"SMS messages served as the primary mode of communication, chosen for their ability to quickly disseminate information across a large scale."
"What is the significance of 'vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations' mentioned in Key Finding 3?","These terms refer to security flaws within the SingHealth network and SCM system. 'Vulnerabilities' are weaknesses that can be exploited, 'weaknesses' are inherent flaws that reduce security, and 'misconfigurations' are incorrect settings that expose systems to risk. In this context, they all contributed to the attacker's ability to succeed."
What does 'exfiltrating data' mean in the context of a cyber attack?,"Exfiltrating data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer system or network to an external location. In essence, it is the act of stealing data."
What are the characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is characterized by being skilled and sophisticated. They typically employ advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures, often involving custom malware and persistent efforts to compromise and maintain access to target systems over extended periods."
What does 'stealthy movements' imply about the attacker's actions?,Stealthy movements suggest that the attacker operated in a way that was difficult to detect. This implies they took measures to avoid triggering security alerts or being noticed by network monitoring systems while carrying out their activities.
What is a 'foothold' in the context of a cyber attack?,"A 'foothold' refers to the initial point of entry or access that an attacker gains into a network or system. Establishing multiple footholds indicates that the attacker secured several independent points of access, making it harder to dislodge them."
What is a 'backdoor' in cybersecurity?,A 'backdoor' is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls to gain access to a computer system or network. Attackers establish backdoors to ensure they can regain access even if their initial entry point is discovered or closed.
What is a 'command and control network' used by attackers?,"A command and control (C2) network is the infrastructure used by attackers to communicate with and control compromised systems. It allows them to send instructions, receive stolen data, and manage their malicious operations remotely."
What is the implication of the attacker having 'customised tools'?,"The attacker having customized tools suggests a high level of technical capability and planning. These tools are specifically designed for the target environment, making them more effective and harder to detect than generic malware."
What does 'technical expertise' mean in relation to the attacker?,"Technical expertise refers to the attacker's advanced knowledge and skills in areas such as programming, networking, cybersecurity, and exploit development. A wide range of technical expertise indicates proficiency across multiple domains relevant to cyber attacks."
What is the meaning of 'breaching the perimeter of the network'?,Breaching the perimeter of the network means successfully bypassing the security measures that protect the boundary between a private network and the outside world (like the internet). It signifies gaining unauthorized access into the internal network infrastructure.
What is the difference between 'obtaining' and 'exfiltrating' data?,Obtaining data refers to the act of acquiring or gaining access to the data. Exfiltrating data is the subsequent step of transferring that obtained data out of the protected network or system to an unauthorized location.
What does it mean for an event to be 'inevitable' in this context?,"In this context, 'inevitable' means that the event was bound to happen and could not have been prevented. Key Finding 5 states that the attacker's success was *not* inevitable, implying that preventative measures could have been taken to avert or mitigate the outcome."
What is the SCM system mentioned in the document?,"The SCM system refers to a specific system within SingHealth that was targeted. While its exact function isn't detailed, it was involved in the data breach, as vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within it contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data."
What is the 'SingHealth network'?,"The SingHealth network refers to the interconnected computer systems and infrastructure belonging to SingHealth. It is the environment where the cyber attack occurred, and vulnerabilities within it were exploited."
What is 'PM' in the context of the attacker's goal?,"In the context of the attacker's goal, 'PM' likely refers to a specific individual or a group of individuals whose personal and outpatient medication data was targeted. The document specifies 'personal and outpatient medication data of PM in the main, and other patients,' indicating PM is a distinct entity whose data was sought."
