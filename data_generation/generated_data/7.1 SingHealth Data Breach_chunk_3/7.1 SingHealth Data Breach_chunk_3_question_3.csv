What does 'patient outreach and communications' entail in this context?,"Patient outreach and communications, in this context, refers to the efforts made to inform and engage with patients following the SingHealth Cyber Breach. This likely involved providing information about the breach, its implications, and any necessary steps patients needed to take."
Explain the role of SMS messages in the communication strategy.,SMS messages were employed as the primary communication tool due to their efficiency in rapidly delivering information to a large number of people. This was crucial for disseminating information related to the SingHealth Cyber Breach.
What is a COI Committee?,"A COI Committee, in this context, likely refers to a Committee of Inquiry. Such committees are typically formed to investigate incidents, determine facts, and identify findings or recommendations."
"What does 'adequate levels' of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources mean for IHiS staff?","Adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources for IHiS staff would mean they possess sufficient knowledge, skills, and tools to understand cybersecurity risks, implement protective measures, and respond effectively to security incidents. The document indicates these levels were insufficient."
What are 'security implications' in the context of cybersecurity findings?,"Security implications refer to the potential negative consequences or risks that arise from a particular situation or finding related to cybersecurity.

"What does it mean for an action to be 'appropriate, effective, or timely' in IT security?","In IT security, an 'appropriate' action is one that is suitable for the situation. An 'effective' action achieves the desired outcome, such as preventing or mitigating a threat. A 'timely' action is taken promptly when needed. The document indicates that IHiS staff failed in these aspects."
What are 'missed opportunities' in the context of preventing data theft?,"Missed opportunities refer to chances to take actions that could have prevented or limited the stealing and exfiltrating of data, but which were not acted upon due to failures in response or decision-making."
