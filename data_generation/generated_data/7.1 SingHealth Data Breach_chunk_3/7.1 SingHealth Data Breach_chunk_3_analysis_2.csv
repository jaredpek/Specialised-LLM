Analyze the public announcement and patient outreach with respect to their timing.,The public announcement was made on 20 July 2018. Patient outreach and communications commenced immediately thereafter.
What was the primary mode of communication used for patient outreach and why?,SMS messages were used as the primary mode of communication. This was due to the need for quick dissemination of information on a large scale.
What did the COI Committee identify?,The COI Committee has identified 5 key Findings.
Analyze Key Finding 1 regarding IHiS staff's cybersecurity preparedness.,"Key Finding 1 states that IHiS staff did not have adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This deficiency prevented them from appreciating the security implications of their findings and from responding effectively to the attack."
What were the shortcomings of certain IHiS staff in IT security incident response?,"Certain IHiS staff holding key roles in IT security incident response and reporting failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action. This resulted in missed opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltrating of data during the attack."
What vulnerabilities were present in the SingHealth network and SCM system?,"There were a number of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations in the SingHealth network and SCM system. These contributed to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data, and many of these could have been remedied before the attack."
Describe the characteristics of the attacker based on Key Finding 4.,The attacker was a skilled and sophisticated actor bearing the characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat group.
What was the attacker's clear goal in mind?,"The attacker had a clear goal in mind, which was to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of PM and other patients."
What TTPs did the attacker employ?,"The attacker employed advanced TTPs, which stands for tools/tactics, techniques, and procedures. This was evident from the suite of advanced, customised, and stealthy malware used, generally stealthy movements, and their ability to find and exploit various vulnerabilities in SingHealth's IT network and the SCM application."
How persistent was the attacker?,"The attacker was persistent, having established multiple footholds and backdoors. They carried out their attack over a period of more than 10 months and made multiple attempts to access the SCM database using various methods."
What resources did the attacker possess?,"The attacker was a well-resourced group. They had an extensive command and control network, the capability to develop numerous customised tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
Analyze Key Finding 5 regarding the inevitability of the attacker's success.,"Key Finding 5 states that while cyber defences may never be impregnable and preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the network perimeter can be difficult, the success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating the data was not inevitable."
What is the significance of the date 20 July 2018 in the context of the key events?,The date 20 July 2018 is significant because it was the date the public announcement was made.
What is the definition of SMS in the context of communication?,"SMS stands for Short Message Service, which is a text messaging service used for quick dissemination of information on a large scale."
How many key findings did the COI Committee identify?,The COI Committee identified 5 key Findings.
"What were the deficiencies in IHiS staff's cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources?","IHiS staff lacked adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources. This meant they were unable to fully appreciate the security implications of their findings and were not equipped to respond effectively to the attack."
What was the consequence of certain IHiS staff failing to take timely action?,"The failure of certain IHiS staff holding key roles in IT security incident response and reporting to take appropriate, effective, or timely action resulted in missed opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltrating of data during the attack."
What is an SCM system in the context of the SingHealth network?,"SCM system refers to a system within the SingHealth network that was subject to vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations, contributing to the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data."
What does 'Advanced Persistent Threat' (APT) imply about the attacker?,"An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) implies that the attacker was skilled and sophisticated, exhibiting characteristics of a group that persistently targets specific entities over extended periods."
What specific data was the attacker targeting?,The attacker's clear goal was to obtain the personal and outpatient medication data of PM and other patients.
Explain the meaning of TTPs as employed by the attacker.,"TTPs, which stands for tools/tactics, techniques, and procedures, refer to the methods and means used by the attacker. In this case, it included advanced, customised, and stealthy malware, stealthy movements, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities."
What does 'multiple footholds and backdoors' suggest about the attacker's actions?,"The establishment of multiple footholds and backdoors indicates that the attacker was persistent and had secured multiple points of entry and access within the network, allowing for sustained presence and control."
How long did the attacker's operation last?,The attacker carried out its attack over a period of over 10 months.
What does it mean for the attacker to be 'well-resourced'?,"Being 'well-resourced' means the attacker group possessed significant capabilities, including an extensive command and control network, the ability to develop numerous customised tools, and a wide range of technical expertise."
What is the implication of cyber defences not being 'impregnable'?,"The implication is that cyber defences cannot be made completely impenetrable, meaning there is always a possibility of a breach, even with strong security measures in place."
What is the definition of 'exfiltrating data'?,Exfiltrating data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network to an external location.
What was the timing of patient outreach relative to the public announcement?,Patient outreach and communications commenced immediately after the public announcement was made on 20 July 2018.
What was the rationale behind using SMS messages for communication?,SMS messages were used as the primary mode of communication because of the need for quick dissemination of information to a large number of people.
What is the significance of '5 key Findings' identified by the COI Committee?,The identification of '5 key Findings' by the COI Committee signifies that there were five major areas of concern or conclusions drawn from their investigation into the cyber breach.
What specific areas of cybersecurity were lacking for IHiS staff?,"The specific areas of cybersecurity that were lacking for IHiS staff included awareness, training, and resources."
What were the consequences of 'missed opportunities' in IT security incident response?,"The missed opportunities in IT security incident response, caused by the failure to take appropriate, effective, or timely action, directly led to the attacker successfully stealing and exfiltrating data."
What types of issues were found in the SingHealth network and SCM system?,"The issues found in the SingHealth network and SCM system included vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations."
What does it mean for an attacker to be 'sophisticated'?,"A 'sophisticated' attacker implies a high level of skill, advanced knowledge, and the use of complex methods and tools in carrying out their attacks."
What kind of data was the attacker interested in obtaining?,The attacker was interested in obtaining personal and outpatient medication data.
What does 'customised malware' suggest about the attacker's capabilities?,"The use of 'customised malware' suggests that the attacker had the capability to develop unique and tailored malicious software specifically designed for their objectives, rather than using off-the-shelf solutions."
What does 'stealthy movements' imply about the attacker's operational methods?,"'Stealthy movements' implies that the attacker operated in a way that avoided detection by security systems and personnel, moving through the network discreetly."
What is the definition of 'footholds' in the context of a cyber attack?,"In the context of a cyber attack, 'footholds' refer to initial points of access or compromised systems that an attacker establishes to maintain a presence within a network and facilitate further intrusion."
What does 'backdoors' signify in relation to the attacker's actions?,"'Backdoors' signify that the attacker created hidden or secret methods of access into the system, allowing them to bypass normal security controls and re-enter the network easily."
What does 'command and control network' refer to for the attacker?,A 'command and control network' for the attacker refers to the infrastructure they use to remotely manage and direct their compromised systems and ongoing operations.
What is the implication of the attacker having 'technical expertise'?,"The attacker having 'technical expertise' implies a deep understanding of computer systems, networks, and cybersecurity principles, enabling them to effectively plan, execute, and adapt their attacks."
What is the definition of 'breaching the perimeter of the network'?,Breaching the perimeter of the network means successfully bypassing the outer security layers designed to protect the internal network from external threats.
