"According to Key Finding 5, was the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data inevitable?","According to Key Finding 5, the attacker's success in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not inevitable, despite cyber defences not being impregnable and the difficulty in preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the network perimeter."
Define 'impregnable' in the context of cyber defences.,"In the context of cyber defences, 'impregnable' means that the defences are impossible to breach or overcome."
What is the significance of Key Finding 5 regarding the inevitability of the attack's success?,"Key Finding 5 signifies that while preventing an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching network perimeters can be challenging due to cyber defences not being impregnable, the ultimate success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating data was not a foregone conclusion."
