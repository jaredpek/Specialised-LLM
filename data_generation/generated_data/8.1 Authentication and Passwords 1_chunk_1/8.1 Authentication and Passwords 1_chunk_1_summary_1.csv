Provide a comprehensive summary of the main objectives of computer security.,"The main objectives of computer security are categorized into seven key concepts: Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, Accountability, Availability, and Non-repudiation. These concepts collectively ensure the security of computer systems and data. Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. Confidentiality is the goal to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. Data/message integrity ensures that when parties exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages, meaning the data remains unmodified. Accountability refers to determining who is responsible for actions. Availability ensures access to systems and resources. Non-repudiation refers to the undenialibility of actions, preventing a user from falsely denying having performed a particular action."
