How is Authentication typically solved or implemented?,"Authentication, which is the act of verifying someone's identity, is typically solved by mechanisms such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)."
What is the role of cryptography in Authentication?,"Cryptography plays a role in Authentication, which is the act of verifying someone's identity, particularly in solutions like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)."
What is Authorization in computer security?,Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action.
How is Authorization implemented in computer systems?,"Authorization, which is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, is solved by using an Access Control List (ACL). An Access Control List is a list of permissions attached to an object, specifying which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects."
What is Confidentiality in computer security?,The goal of Confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
How is Confidentiality achieved in computer security?,"Confidentiality, which aims to keep the contents of communication or data secret, is achieved through encryption. Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access."
Does Confidentiality involve cryptography?,"Yes, Confidentiality, which aims to keep the contents of communication or data secret, is solved by encryption, which is a cryptographic method."
What is Data/message integrity?,"Data/message integrity ensures that the contents of messages exchanged between parties, such as Alice and Bob, remain unmodified by a third party. The goal is to prevent unauthorized alteration of data."
How is Data/message integrity maintained?,"Data/message integrity, which ensures that message contents are unmodified, is maintained by using a Message Authentication Code (MAC). A Message Authentication Code is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and to provide integrity and authenticity assurances on the message."
Is cryptography used for Data/message integrity?,"Yes, Data/message integrity, which ensures that message contents are unmodified, is solved by using a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which is a cryptographic method."
What is Accountability in computer security?,Accountability in computer security refers to determining who is responsible for actions taken within a system.
How is Accountability ensured in computer systems?,"Accountability, which determines who is responsible for actions, is ensured by maintaining a log trail. A log trail is a record of events that have occurred in a system, allowing for auditing and tracing of activities."
What is Availability in the context of computer security?,Availability refers to ensuring access to system resources for authorized users when needed.
How is Availability achieved in computer security?,"Availability, which ensures access to system resources, is achieved by adding redundancy. Redundancy involves duplicating critical components or functions of a system to ensure continued operation in case of failure."
What is Non-repudiation?,"Non-repudiation ensures undenialibility, meaning that a party cannot falsely deny having sent a message or performed an action."
How is Non-repudiation implemented?,"Non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility, is implemented by using digital signatures. A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents."
Does Non-repudiation involve cryptography?,"Yes, Non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility, is solved by using digital signatures, which are a cryptographic method."
What is the primary concern of Authentication?,The primary concern of Authentication is verifying someone's identity.
What is the primary concern of Authorization?,The primary concern of Authorization is checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action.
What is the primary concern of Confidentiality?,The primary concern of Confidentiality is to keep the contents of communication or data secret.
What is the primary concern of Data/message integrity?,The primary concern of Data/message integrity is to ensure that the contents of messages remain unmodified by a third party.
What is the primary concern of Accountability?,The primary concern of Accountability is to determine who is responsible for actions within a system.
What is the primary concern of Availability?,The primary concern of Availability is to ensure access to system resources.
What is the primary concern of Non-repudiation?,"The primary concern of Non-repudiation is to ensure undenialibility, preventing a party from falsely denying an action."
Why is Authentication especially important in cyberspace?,"Authentication, the act of verifying someone's identity, is especially important in cyberspace due to the distributed and often anonymous nature of online interactions, where verifying user identity is crucial for security."
What is 2FA and which computer security concept does it address?,"2FA stands for Two-Factor Authentication, and it is a mechanism used to solve or implement Authentication. Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity."
What is an Access Control List (ACL) and what security concept does it address?,An Access Control List (ACL) is a mechanism used to solve or implement Authorization. Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action.
What is encryption used for in computer security?,Encryption is used to solve or achieve Confidentiality. Confidentiality is the goal of keeping the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
What is a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and what security concept does it address?,A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a mechanism used to solve or implement Data/message integrity. Data/message integrity ensures that the contents of messages remain unmodified by a third party.
What is a log trail used for in computer security?,A log trail is used to solve or ensure Accountability. Accountability refers to determining who is responsible for actions taken within a system.
What is redundancy used for in computer security?,Redundancy is used to solve or achieve Availability. Availability refers to ensuring access to system resources for authorized users when needed.
What are digital signatures used for in computer security?,"Digital signatures are used to solve or implement Non-repudiation. Non-repudiation ensures undenialibility, meaning that a party cannot falsely deny having sent a message or performed an action."
Which computer security concepts are explicitly mentioned as involving cryptography?,"The computer security concepts explicitly mentioned as involving cryptography are Authentication, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, and Non-repudiation."
What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, while Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action. Authentication confirms 'who you are,' and Authorization determines 'what you can do.'"
How does 'identity' relate to Authentication?,"'Identity' is the core concept of Authentication, as Authentication is defined as the act of verifying someone's identity."
How does 'permission' relate to Authorization?,"'Permission' is central to Authorization, as Authorization is defined as the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action."
What does 'secrecy contents' imply for Confidentiality?,"'Secrecy contents' implies that Confidentiality's goal is to keep the actual information or data secret, preventing unauthorized disclosure."
What does 'unmodified' signify for Data/message integrity?,'Unmodified' signifies that Data/message integrity ensures that the contents of messages have not been altered or tampered with by any unauthorized third party.
What does 'who is responsible' refer to in the context of Accountability?,"'Who is responsible' refers to the core question that Accountability addresses, which is identifying the party accountable for specific actions or events within a system."
What does 'access' refer to in the context of Availability?,'Access' in the context of Availability refers to the ability of authorized users to reach and utilize system resources and information when they need to.
What does 'undenialibility' mean for Non-repudiation?,"'Undenialibility' means that a party cannot legitimately deny having performed a particular action or sent a specific message, which is the fundamental principle of Non-repudiation."
Can you list the computer security concepts that are solved using cryptographic methods?,"The computer security concepts that are solved using cryptographic methods include Authentication (e.g., 2FA), Confidentiality (e.g., encryption), Data/message integrity (e.g., MAC-msg auth code), and Non-repudiation (e.g., digital signatures)."
