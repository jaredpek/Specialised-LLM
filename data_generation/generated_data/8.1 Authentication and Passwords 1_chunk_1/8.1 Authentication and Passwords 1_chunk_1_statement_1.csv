Define authentication in the context of computer security.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, and it is especially important in cyberspace."
What is the primary purpose of authentication in computer security?,The primary purpose of authentication is to verify someone's identity. This process is particularly important in cyberspace.
How is authentication typically solved or addressed in computer security?,"Authentication, which involves verifying identity, is typically solved by methods such as 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)."
Does authentication involve cryptographic methods?,"Yes, authentication, which is the act of verifying identity, can involve cryptographic methods, as seen with solutions like 2FA."
Explain the significance of authentication in cyberspace.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, and it is especially important in cyberspace to ensure that users are who they claim to be."
What is authorization in computer security?,Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action.
How is authorization implemented or solved in computer security?,"Authorization, which involves checking if a user has permission to conduct an action, is typically solved by using an Access Control List."
Differentiate between authentication and authorization.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. Authorization, on the other hand, is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action."
What mechanism is commonly used to solve authorization issues?,"Authorization, which determines if a user has permission for an action, is commonly solved by implementing an Access Control List."
Is authorization concerned with identity verification or permission checking?,"Authorization is concerned with permission checking, specifically whether a user has the necessary permission to conduct a particular action. Identity verification is the domain of authentication."
Define confidentiality in the context of computer security.,The goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
What is the main objective of confidentiality in computer security?,"The main objective of confidentiality is to keep the contents of transient communication or data, whether on temporary or persistent storage, secret."
How is confidentiality typically achieved or solved?,"Confidentiality, which aims to keep secrecy contents, is typically solved by using encryption."
Does confidentiality rely on cryptographic techniques?,"Yes, confidentiality, which focuses on keeping secrecy contents, relies on cryptographic techniques, specifically encryption, to achieve its goal."
Explain what 'secrecy contents' refers to in the context of confidentiality.,"In the context of confidentiality, ""secrecy contents"" refers to the information within a transient communication or data stored on temporary or persistent storage that needs to be kept secret from unauthorized access."
What types of data storage does confidentiality aim to protect?,"Confidentiality aims to protect the contents of data on both temporary and persistent storage, as well as transient communications, by keeping them secret."
What is data/message integrity in computer security?,"Data/message integrity refers to the assurance that when parties like Alice and Bob exchange messages, a third party is unable to modify the contents of their messages."
What is the primary concern addressed by data/message integrity?,The primary concern addressed by data/message integrity is preventing a third party from being able to modify the contents of messages exchanged between users.
How is data/message integrity typically ensured or solved?,"Data/message integrity, which ensures that contents remain unmodified, is typically solved by using MAC (Message Authentication Code)."
Are cryptographic methods used to ensure data/message integrity?,"Yes, cryptographic methods are used to ensure data/message integrity. This is typically solved by using a Message Authentication Code (MAC)."
Explain the role of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) in data integrity.,"A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used to solve data/message integrity by ensuring that the contents of messages remain unmodified, thereby preventing unauthorized third-party alterations."
What does 'unmodified' mean in the context of data/message integrity?,"In the context of data/message integrity, ""unmodified"" means that the original contents of a message or data have not been altered or tampered with by any unauthorized third party during transmission or storage."
Define accountability in computer security.,Accountability in computer security refers to determining who is responsible for actions or events.
How is accountability typically solved or maintained?,"Accountability, which identifies who is responsible, is typically solved by maintaining a log trail."
What is the purpose of a log trail in achieving accountability?,"A log trail serves the purpose of solving accountability by providing a record of actions and events, thereby helping to determine who is responsible for specific activities."
What question does accountability primarily answer in computer security?,"Accountability primarily answers the question of ""who is responsible"" for actions or events within a computer system."
What does availability mean in computer security?,Availability in computer security refers to ensuring access to resources and services.
How is availability typically ensured or solved?,"Availability, which ensures access, is typically solved by adding redundancy."
Explain the role of redundancy in ensuring availability.,"Redundancy plays a crucial role in ensuring availability by providing duplicate or backup systems and components, which helps maintain access to resources even if one part fails."
Why is 'access' a key aspect of availability?,'Access' is a key aspect of availability because the concept of availability in computer security is specifically about ensuring that users can access resources and services when needed.
Define non-repudiation in computer security.,"Non-repudiation in computer security refers to undenialibility, meaning that a party cannot deny having performed an action or sent a message."
How is non-repudiation typically achieved or solved?,"Non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility, is typically solved by using digital signatures."
Does non-repudiation involve cryptographic techniques?,"Yes, non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility, involves cryptographic techniques, specifically digital signatures."
What is the purpose of digital signatures in non-repudiation?,"Digital signatures serve the purpose of solving non-repudiation by providing a mechanism to ensure undenialibility, meaning a party cannot legitimately deny having performed an action or sent a message."
Explain the concept of 'undenialibility' in non-repudiation.,"In non-repudiation, ""undenialibility"" means that a sender cannot falsely deny having sent a message or performed an action, and a receiver cannot falsely deny having received a message. This is typically achieved through digital signatures."
Which of the 7 key computer security concepts are solved using cryptographic methods?,"The computer security concepts solved using cryptographic methods are Authentication (e.g., 2FA), Confidentiality (e.g., encryption), Data/message integrity (e.g., Message Authentication Code), and Non-repudiation (e.g., digital signatures)."
