What does Accountability mean in computer security?,Accountability in computer security refers to establishing who is responsible for actions taken within a system.
Define Availability as a key concept in computer security.,Availability in computer security refers to ensuring access to systems and resources.
Explain Non-repudiation in the field of computer security.,"Non-repudiation in computer security refers to the undenialibility of actions, meaning a party cannot falsely deny having performed a particular action."

What mechanism is used to solve Authorization in computer security?,"Authorization is solved by managing permissions, often implemented using an Access Control List."
How is Confidentiality achieved in computer security?,"Confidentiality, which aims to maintain the secrecy of contents, is solved through encryption and cryptographic methods."
What methods are used to ensure Data/message integrity?,"Data/message integrity, which ensures that data remains unmodified, is solved using mechanisms such as Message Authentication Code (MAC) and cryptographic methods."
How is Accountability addressed in computer security?,"Accountability, which identifies who is responsible for actions, is solved by maintaining a log trail."
What approach is used to ensure Availability in computer security?,"Availability, which ensures access, is solved by adding redundancy to systems."
How is Non-repudiation implemented in computer security?,"Non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility, is solved through the use of digital signatures and cryptographic methods."
List the 7 key concepts in the field of computer security.,"The 7 key concepts in the field of computer security are: Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, Accountability, Availability, and Non-repudiation."
Define Authentication and describe how it is solved.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, and it is especially important in cyberspace. It is solved by verifying identity, for example, through mechanisms like Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and cryptographic methods."
Explain Authorization and its solution in computer security.,"Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action. It is solved by managing permissions, often implemented using an Access Control List."
What is Confidentiality and how is it achieved?,The goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. It is achieved through encryption and cryptographic methods.
Describe Data/message integrity and the methods used to ensure it.,"Data/message integrity refers to the principle that when parties exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages.

Explain Non-repudiation and the methods used to achieve it.,"Non-repudiation in computer security refers to the undenialibility of actions, meaning a party cannot falsely deny having performed a particular action. It is achieved through the use of digital signatures and cryptographic methods."
Why is Authentication particularly important in cyberspace?,"Authentication is particularly important in cyberspace because it is the act of verifying someone's identity, which is crucial for secure interactions and access in a digital environment."
What is the primary objective of Confidentiality?,The primary objective of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
What is the main concern that Data/message integrity aims to prevent?,"The main concern that Data/message integrity aims to prevent is the modification of message contents by a third party when two entities, such as Alice and Bob, exchange messages."
What is the core idea behind Accountability in computer security?,The core idea behind Accountability in computer security is to determine who is responsible for specific actions.
"What does ""access"" refer to in the context of Availability?","In the context of Availability, ""access"" refers to the ability to reach and utilize systems and resources."
"What does ""undenialibility"" mean in relation to Non-repudiation?","In relation to Non-repudiation, ""undenialibility"" means that a party cannot falsely deny having performed a particular action or having sent a message."
What specific mechanism is mentioned for solving Authorization?,The specific mechanism mentioned for solving Authorization is an Access Control List.
What technology is used to solve Confidentiality?,Confidentiality is solved through encryption.
What code-based mechanism helps solve Data/message integrity?,A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a code-based mechanism that helps solve Data/message integrity.
What record-keeping method solves Accountability?,A log trail is the record-keeping method that solves Accountability.
What strategy is employed to solve Availability?,The strategy employed to solve Availability is adding redundancy.
What type of signature solves Non-repudiation?,Digital signatures solve Non-repudiation.
What authentication factor is mentioned as an example for solving Authentication?,Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mentioned as an example for solving Authentication.
Which of the 7 key computer security concepts involve cryptography in their solution?,"The computer security concepts that involve cryptography in their solution are Authentication, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, and Non-repudiation."
How does cryptography contribute to Authentication?,Cryptography contributes to Authentication by being a method used to solve the verification of identity.
What role does cryptography play in Confidentiality?,"Cryptography plays a role in Confidentiality by being the method, specifically encryption, used to keep contents secret."
In what way is cryptography used for Data/message integrity?,"Cryptography is used for Data/message integrity as a method, specifically through Message Authentication Code (MAC), to ensure that messages remain unmodified."
How does cryptography support Non-repudiation?,"Cryptography supports Non-repudiation through the use of digital signatures, which provide undenialibility of actions."
What is the primary concern addressed by the concept of Data/message integrity?,The primary concern addressed by the concept of Data/message integrity is preventing a third party from modifying the contents of messages exchanged between two parties.
Which computer security concept focuses on preventing the denial of actions?,"Non-repudiation is the computer security concept that focuses on preventing the denial of actions, ensuring undenialibility."
What is the purpose of an Access Control List in computer security?,"The purpose of an Access Control List in computer security is to solve Authorization by managing permissions, checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action."
How does adding redundancy enhance computer security?,"Adding redundancy enhances computer security by solving Availability, which ensures continuous access to systems and resources."
