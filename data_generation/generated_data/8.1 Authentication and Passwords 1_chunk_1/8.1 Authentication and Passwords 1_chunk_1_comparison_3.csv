Compare Authentication with Authorization in computer security.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, and it is especially important in cyberspace. It is solved by methods such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Authorization, on the other hand, is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. It is solved by mechanisms like an Access control list. The key difference lies in their focus: Authentication confirms *who* a user is (identity), while Authorization determines *what* that user is allowed to do (permission)."
What are the differences between Authentication and Confidentiality?,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. It addresses the question of 'who' is accessing a system or resource, and is solved by methods such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Confidentiality, however, has the goal of keeping the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. It focuses on protecting the 'secrecy contents' of information and is solved by encryption. While Authentication confirms identity, Confidentiality ensures data remains private from unauthorized disclosure."
Explain the distinction between Authorization and Confidentiality in computer security.,"Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. It determines what actions a verified user can perform, and is typically solved by an Access control list. Confidentiality, in contrast, aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. It is concerned with preventing unauthorized disclosure of information and is solved by encryption. Authorization manages user permissions, while Confidentiality protects the secrecy of data itself."
Compare Data/message integrity with Confidentiality.,"Data/message integrity refers to the assurance that when parties like Alice and Bob exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages. It ensures that data remains 'unmodified' and is solved by mechanisms such as Message Authentication Code (MAC-msg auth code). Confidentiality, conversely, has the goal of keeping the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. It focuses on the 'secrecy contents' of information and is solved by encryption. Data/message integrity ensures data has not been altered, while Confidentiality ensures data is not disclosed to unauthorized parties."

Encryption focuses on secrecy, while MAC-msg auth code focuses on preventing unauthorized alteration."
Compare a Log trail with Digital signatures.,"A Log trail is a mechanism used to solve Accountability, which refers to establishing 'who is responsible' for actions. It provides a record of events to trace responsibility. Digital signatures (or digital sig), on the other hand, are a method used to solve Non-repudiation, which refers to 'undenialibility'. They provide cryptographic proof to prevent a party from denying an action. A log trail helps identify responsibility after an event, while digital signatures prevent denial of an action at the time it occurs."
Compare Identity with Permission in computer security.,"Identity refers to who a person or entity claims to be, and its verification is the core of Authentication. Permission refers to the specific rights or privileges granted to a user to perform certain actions or access certain resources, and its checking is the core of Authorization.
