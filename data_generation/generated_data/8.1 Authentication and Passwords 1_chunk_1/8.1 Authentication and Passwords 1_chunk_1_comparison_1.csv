Compare Authentication with Authorization.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, which is especially important in cyberspace and can be solved by mechanisms like 2FA. Authorization, on the other hand, is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct a specific action, and it can be solved by an Access control list. While Authentication confirms who a user is, Authorization determines what that user is allowed to do."
What are the differences between Confidentiality and Data/message integrity?,"Confidentiality is the goal of keeping the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, typically solved by encryption. Data/message integrity, however, focuses on ensuring that when messages are exchanged, a third party is unable to modify their contents, which can be solved by a MAC-msg auth code. Confidentiality is about preventing unauthorized disclosure, while Data/message integrity is about preventing unauthorized alteration."
Distinguish between Accountability and Non-repudiation.,"Accountability refers to determining who is responsible for actions, and it is typically solved by a log trail. Non-repudiation, conversely, ensures undenialibility, meaning that a party cannot falsely deny having sent a message or performed an action, and it is solved by digital signatures. Accountability tracks responsibility, while Non-repudiation prevents denial of actions."
Compare Availability with Confidentiality.,"Availability refers to ensuring access, and it is solved by adding redundancy. Confidentiality, in contrast, is the goal of keeping the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, which is solved by encryption. Availability focuses on the accessibility of resources, whereas Confidentiality focuses on the secrecy of information."
