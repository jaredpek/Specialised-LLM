What are the seven main objectives of computer security?,"The seven main objectives, or key concepts, in the field of computer security are: Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, Accountability, Availability, and Non-repudiation. \n\n*   **Authentication** is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. \n*   **Authorization** is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. \n*   **Confidentiality** aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. \n*   **Data/message integrity** ensures that when parties exchange messages, a third party cannot modify the contents of their messages. \n*   **Accountability** refers to determining who is responsible for actions. \n*   **Availability** refers to ensuring access. \n*   **Non-repudiation** refers to undenialibility."
Define Authentication and explain how it is typically addressed in computer security.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, a process that is especially important in cyberspace. This concept is typically addressed by mechanisms such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). \n\n**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity, adding an extra layer of security beyond just a password."
Explain the concept of Authorization within computer security and its common solution.,"Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some specific action. This concept is commonly solved by implementing an Access Control List. \n\nAn **Access Control List (ACL)** is a list of permissions attached to an object, specifying which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects."
"What is Confidentiality in computer security, and what method is used to achieve it?","Confidentiality is the goal of keeping the secrecy contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This is achieved through encryption. \n\n**Encryption** is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that only authorized parties can understand it."
Describe Data/message integrity and the mechanism used to ensure it.,"Data/message integrity ensures that when parties like Alice and Bob exchange messages, a third party is unable to modify the contents of their messages, meaning the data remains unmodified. This is solved by using a Message Authentication Code (MAC). \n\nA **Message Authentication Code (MAC)** is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message, providing both data integrity and authenticity assurances."
"Analyse Accountability in computer security, focusing on its definition and how it is solved.","Accountability in computer security refers to determining who is responsible for actions. This is solved by maintaining a log trail. \n\nA **log trail** (or audit trail) is a chronological record of events, activities, or operations within a system, used to track actions and identify the responsible party."
"What does Availability mean in the context of computer security, and how is it typically ensured?","Availability in computer security refers to ensuring access to systems and data. It is typically ensured by adding redundancy. \n\n**Redundancy** involves duplicating critical components or functions of a system to increase reliability and ensure continued operation even if one component fails, thereby maintaining availability."
Explain Non-repudiation and the method used to achieve it.,"Non-repudiation refers to undenialibility, meaning that a sender cannot deny having sent a message, nor can a receiver deny having received a message. This is solved by using digital signatures. \n\nA **digital signature** is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents, providing assurance of the origin, identity, and integrity of the data."
Which of the computer security concepts are explicitly mentioned as involving 'crypto' solutions?,"The computer security concepts explicitly mentioned as involving 'crypto' solutions are Authentication, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, and Non-repudiation. \n\n**Cryptography** (often shortened to 'crypto') is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties (called adversaries), involving methods like encryption and digital signatures."
"Discuss the importance of verifying identity in cyberspace, referencing the relevant security concept.","Verifying someone's identity is of paramount importance in cyberspace, and this concern is addressed by the computer security concept of Authentication. \n\n**Authentication** is defined as the act of verifying someone's identity, and it is especially important in cyberspace to ensure that users or systems are who they claim to be before granting access or allowing operations."
"How does an Access Control List contribute to computer security, and which key concept does it address?","An Access Control List (ACL) contributes to computer security by solving the concept of Authorization. \n\n**Authorization** is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a list of permissions attached to an object, specifying which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects, thereby enforcing authorization."
"What is the primary goal of Confidentiality, and how does encryption help achieve it?","The primary goal of Confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. Encryption helps achieve this by converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access. \n\n**Confidentiality** ensures that only authorized parties can access and understand sensitive information. **Encryption** is the process of transforming data into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm, which can only be reverted to its original readable format (plaintext) with a decryption key, thus safeguarding its secrecy."
Explain how Data/message integrity prevents unauthorized modifications to messages.,"Data/message integrity prevents unauthorized modifications to messages by ensuring that the contents remain unmodified during exchange. This is achieved through the use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC). \n\n**Data/message integrity** means that when parties exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages. A **Message Authentication Code (MAC)** provides a cryptographic checksum that can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of data, detecting any unauthorized alterations."
What mechanism is used to establish accountability in computer systems?,"Accountability in computer systems is established by maintaining a log trail. \n\n**Accountability** refers to the ability to determine who is responsible for actions performed within a system. A **log trail** (also known as an audit trail) is a chronological record of events, activities, or operations, which can be reviewed to trace actions back to their originators, thereby establishing accountability."
How does adding redundancy enhance the Availability of computer systems?,"Adding redundancy enhances the Availability of computer systems by ensuring continued access to resources and data even in the event of failures. \n\n**Availability** is a key concept in computer security that ensures authorized users can access information and resources when needed. **Redundancy** involves duplicating critical system components or data, so if one component fails, a backup can immediately take over, preventing service interruptions and maintaining availability."
Describe the role of digital signatures in achieving Non-repudiation.,"Digital signatures play a crucial role in achieving Non-repudiation by providing a verifiable means to prove the origin and integrity of digital communications. \n\n**Non-repudiation** refers to undenialibility, meaning that a sender cannot legitimately deny having sent a message, nor can a receiver deny having received it. A **digital signature** is a cryptographic mechanism that binds an identity to a message, ensuring that the sender cannot later disavow the message and that the message has not been altered in transit."
What is the significance of 'identity' in the context of Authentication?,"The significance of 'identity' in the context of Authentication is central, as Authentication is fundamentally the act of verifying someone's identity. \n\n**Authentication** ensures that a user or entity is who they claim to be by confirming their identity, which is especially important in cyberspace to prevent unauthorized access and maintain system security."
"In computer security, what does 'permission' relate to, and which concept addresses it?","In computer security, 'permission' relates to the actions a user is allowed to perform, and the concept that addresses this is Authorization. \n\n**Authorization** is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do within a system."
What is meant by 'secrecy contents' in relation to Confidentiality?,"In relation to Confidentiality, 'secrecy contents' refers to the sensitive information or data that must be protected from unauthorized disclosure. \n\n**Confidentiality** aims to keep these 'secrecy contents' of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems can access and understand them."
How does the 'unmodified' characteristic relate to Data/message integrity?,"The 'unmodified' characteristic is directly related to Data/message integrity, as the core principle of integrity is to ensure that data or messages remain unchanged from their original state. \n\n**Data/message integrity** means that when information is exchanged, it should arrive at the recipient exactly as it was sent, without any unauthorized or accidental modification by a third party. The 'unmodified' state is the desired outcome of successful integrity measures."
Which computer security concept focuses on determining 'who is responsible'?,"The computer security concept that focuses on determining 'who is responsible' is Accountability. \n\n**Accountability** ensures that actions performed within a system can be traced back to the individual or entity that initiated them, thereby establishing responsibility for those actions, often through mechanisms like log trails."
What does 'access' refer to in the context of Availability?,"In the context of Availability, 'access' refers to the ability of authorized users to reach and utilize information, systems, and resources when needed. \n\n**Availability** is a key security objective focused on ensuring that legitimate users are not denied access to the services or data they require, often achieved by adding redundancy to critical components."
Explain 'undenialibility' as it pertains to Non-repudiation.,"'Undenialibility' as it pertains to Non-repudiation means that a party involved in a communication or transaction cannot falsely deny having participated in it. \n\n**Non-repudiation** is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something. For example, a sender cannot deny sending a message, and a receiver cannot deny receiving it, because there is irrefutable proof, often provided by digital signatures."
"What is 2FA, and which security concept does it help solve?","2FA, or Two-Factor Authentication, is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. It helps solve the security concept of Authentication. \n\n**Authentication** is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** provides an enhanced layer of security by requiring more than one method of verification, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access."
How does a log trail contribute to the overall security posture of a system?,"A log trail contributes to the overall security posture of a system by solving the concept of Accountability. \n\n**Accountability** refers to determining who is responsible for actions within a system. A **log trail** (or audit trail) provides a chronological record of events, allowing administrators to track activities, identify unauthorized access attempts, and determine the source of security incidents, thereby enhancing the system's security posture."
Which computer security concepts are enhanced by cryptographic methods?,"The computer security concepts enhanced by cryptographic methods include Authentication, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, and Non-repudiation. \n\n**Cryptography** involves techniques for secure communication. For **Authentication**, it can be used in methods like 2FA. For **Confidentiality**, encryption keeps contents secret. For **Data/message integrity**, Message Authentication Codes (MAC) ensure data is unmodified. For **Non-repudiation**, digital signatures provide undenialibility."
Differentiate between Authentication and Authorization based on their definitions.,"Authentication and Authorization are distinct but related concepts in computer security. \n\n**Authentication** is the act of verifying someone's identity, confirming that a user is who they claim to be. \n**Authorization** is the act of checking whether an authenticated user has permission to conduct some specific action. \n\nIn essence, authentication answers 'Are you who you say you are?' while authorization answers 'Are you allowed to do that?'"
What are the primary concerns addressed by Confidentiality and Data/message integrity?,"The primary concerns addressed by Confidentiality and Data/message integrity are the secrecy and unmodified state of data, respectively. \n\n**Confidentiality** is concerned with keeping the contents of communication or data secret, preventing unauthorized disclosure. \n**Data/message integrity** is concerned with ensuring that the contents of messages remain unmodified by a third party during exchange, preventing unauthorized alteration."
How does the principle of 'adding redundancy' support a key computer security objective?,"The principle of 'adding redundancy' directly supports the key computer security objective of Availability. \n\n**Availability** ensures that authorized users have consistent and reliable access to information and resources. By **adding redundancy**, critical system components or data are duplicated, so if one part fails, the redundant component can take over, preventing service interruptions and maintaining continuous access."
What is the purpose of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) in computer security?,"The purpose of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) in computer security is to ensure data/message integrity, specifically by verifying that the contents of messages remain unmodified. \n\nA **Message Authentication Code (MAC)** is a cryptographic checksum that provides assurance that a message has not been altered in transit and that it originates from the claimed sender, thereby solving the problem of ensuring data/message integrity."
Which security concept is concerned with preventing a sender from denying they sent a message?,"The security concept concerned with preventing a sender from denying they sent a message is Non-repudiation. \n\n**Non-repudiation** refers to undenialibility, meaning that a party involved in a communication cannot falsely deny having participated in it. This is typically achieved through mechanisms like digital signatures, which provide irrefutable proof of origin."
List the computer security concepts that are solved using cryptographic techniques.,"The computer security concepts that are solved using cryptographic techniques include Authentication (e.g., 2FA crypto), Confidentiality (e.g., encryption crypto), Data/message integrity (e.g., MAC-msg auth code crypto), and Non-repudiation (e.g., digital sig crypto). \n\n**Cryptography** involves mathematical techniques to secure communications and data, providing solutions for verifying identities, ensuring secrecy, maintaining data integrity, and guaranteeing undenialibility."
What are the first three key concepts in computer security?,"The first three key concepts in computer security are Authentication, Authorization, and Confidentiality. \n\n*   **Authentication** is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. \n*   **Authorization** is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. \n*   **Confidentiality** aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret."
Explain the difference between 'identity' and 'permission' in the context of computer security.,"In the context of computer security, 'identity' and 'permission' relate to distinct concepts. 'Identity' is central to Authentication, while 'permission' is central to Authorization. \n\n**Identity** refers to who a user or entity claims to be, and **Authentication** is the process of verifying this claim. \n**Permission** refers to what actions an authenticated user or entity is allowed to perform, and **Authorization** is the process of checking these permissions."
How does the concept of 'secrecy contents' apply to both transient communication and stored data?,"The concept of 'secrecy contents' applies to both transient communication and data on temporary or persistent storage under the umbrella of Confidentiality. \n\n**Confidentiality** aims to keep these 'secrecy contents' secret, whether they are part of a communication that is currently in transit (transient communication) or data that is being held on a storage medium (temporary or persistent storage). The goal is to prevent unauthorized access to the sensitive information regardless of its state or location."
What is the role of a 'log trail' in ensuring security?,"A 'log trail' plays a crucial role in ensuring security by solving the concept of Accountability. \n\n**Accountability** refers to determining who is responsible for actions within a system. A **log trail** (or audit trail) provides a chronological record of events, activities, or operations, which can be used to trace actions, identify security breaches, and hold individuals responsible for their activities, thereby enhancing overall security."
Discuss the importance of Data/message integrity in preventing third-party interference.,"Data/message integrity is of paramount importance in preventing third-party interference because it ensures that the contents of messages remain unmodified during exchange. \n\nWhen parties like Alice and Bob exchange messages, **Data/message integrity** guarantees that no unauthorized third party can alter the information. This is critical for maintaining trust and reliability in communications, as any modification could lead to incorrect decisions or malicious outcomes."
Which computer security concept is concerned with ensuring 'access'?,"The computer security concept concerned with ensuring 'access' is Availability. \n\n**Availability** is a key objective in computer security, focusing on ensuring that authorized users can consistently and reliably access information and resources when they need them. This is often achieved by implementing measures like adding redundancy to critical systems."
What are the methods used to solve the last three key concepts of computer security?,The methods used to solve the last three key concepts of computer security are: \n\n*   **Accountability** is solved by maintaining a log trail. \n*   **Availability** is solved by adding redundancy. \n*   **Non-repudiation** is solved by using digital signatures. \n\n**Log trail** refers to a chronological record of events. **Redundancy** involves duplicating critical components. **Digital signatures** are cryptographic schemes for verifying authenticity and integrity.
Explain how 'digital signatures' provide 'undenialibility'.,"Digital signatures provide 'undenialibility' by creating cryptographic proof that a specific individual or entity sent a message and that the message has not been altered. \n\n**Non-repudiation** refers to undenialibility, meaning a sender cannot deny having sent a message. A **digital signature** is a mathematical scheme that binds a signer's identity to a digital message, making it extremely difficult for the signer to later claim they did not send the message or that the message was tampered with, thus providing undenialibility."
What is the role of 'encryption' in maintaining confidentiality?,"Encryption plays a fundamental role in maintaining confidentiality by transforming the 'secrecy contents' of communication or data into an unreadable format. \n\n**Confidentiality** aims to keep information secret from unauthorized parties. **Encryption** is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key, ensuring that only those with the correct decryption key can revert the data to its original, readable form, thereby preserving its secrecy."
How does 'MAC-msg auth code' ensure data integrity?,"'MAC-msg auth code' (Message Authentication Code) ensures data integrity by providing a cryptographic checksum that verifies the message has not been modified. \n\n**Data/message integrity** ensures that the contents of messages remain unmodified during exchange. A **Message Authentication Code (MAC)** is generated using a secret key and the message content. The recipient can re-calculate the MAC and compare it with the received MAC; if they match, it confirms the message's integrity and authenticity, ensuring it is 'unmodified'."
Discuss the importance of Authentication in preventing unauthorized access.,"Authentication is of critical importance in preventing unauthorized access because it is the act of verifying someone's identity before granting them entry or privileges. \n\nBy confirming that a user or system is who they claim to be, **Authentication** acts as the first line of defense against unauthorized access. Without proper authentication, any entity could potentially gain access to sensitive information or systems, making it especially important in cyberspace."
What are the implications of a lack of Accountability in a computer system?,"A lack of Accountability in a computer system implies that it would be impossible to determine 'who is responsible' for actions, leading to significant security and operational risks. \n\nWithout **Accountability**, if a security breach occurs, data is corrupted, or an unauthorized action takes place, there would be no way to trace the event back to its source. This hinders incident response, forensic analysis, and the ability to enforce policies, as no individual or entity can be held responsible, which is why solutions like log trails are crucial."
How does the concept of 'adding redundancy' specifically address the challenge of system failures?,"The concept of 'adding redundancy' specifically addresses the challenge of system failures by providing backup components or data, thereby ensuring continuous operation and maintaining Availability. \n\nWhen a system component fails, **redundancy** allows a duplicate component to seamlessly take over its function, preventing downtime and ensuring that services and data remain accessible to authorized users. This directly supports the objective of **Availability**, which is to guarantee access."
What is the primary distinction between Confidentiality and Data/message integrity?,"The primary distinction between Confidentiality and Data/message integrity lies in what aspect of data they protect. Confidentiality protects the secrecy of data, while Data/message integrity protects against unauthorized modification. \n\n**Confidentiality** ensures that only authorized individuals can view or access sensitive information, keeping its 'secrecy contents' hidden. \n**Data/message integrity** ensures that the data remains 'unmodified' and accurate during transmission or storage, preventing any unauthorized alteration by a third party."
Which computer security concept is concerned with 'permission'?,"The computer security concept concerned with 'permission' is Authorization. \n\n**Authorization** is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. It determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do within a system, based on predefined rules and privileges, often managed through an Access Control List."
Describe the role of 'log trail' in forensic analysis.,"A 'log trail' plays a critical role in forensic analysis by providing a chronological record of events that can be examined to reconstruct activities and identify the cause of security incidents. \n\nAs a solution for **Accountability**, a **log trail** documents 'who is responsible' for actions. In forensic analysis, these detailed records allow investigators to trace user activities, system changes, and network events, helping them understand how a breach occurred, what data was affected, and who was involved."
What are the implications of a system lacking Non-repudiation?,"A system lacking Non-repudiation would mean that parties involved in communications or transactions could easily deny their actions, leading to a lack of trust and legal enforceability. \n\n**Non-repudiation** provides 'undenialibility', ensuring that a sender cannot falsely deny sending a message, and a receiver cannot deny receiving it. Without this, disputes could arise where one party denies involvement, making it difficult to establish facts or hold parties accountable for their digital interactions, which is why digital signatures are crucial."
How does '2FA' enhance the security of user identities?,"'2FA' (Two-Factor Authentication) enhances the security of user identities by requiring more than one form of verification, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to impersonate legitimate users. \n\n**Authentication** is the act of verifying someone's identity. **2FA** strengthens this by demanding two distinct pieces of evidence (e.g., something you know like a password, and something you have like a phone or token). Even if one factor is compromised, the attacker still needs the second factor, thereby providing a much stronger assurance of the user's identity and reducing the risk of identity theft or unauthorized access."
Analyse the role of 'Access control list' in managing user permissions.,"An 'Access control list' (ACL) plays a fundamental role in managing user permissions by explicitly defining what actions specific users or system processes are authorized to perform on objects. \n\nThis directly addresses the computer security concept of **Authorization**, which is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. The **Access Control List (ACL)** serves as a detailed record of these permissions, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with resources in a specified manner, thereby enforcing granular control over access."
"What is the primary objective of computer security, as outlined by its key concepts?","The primary objective of computer security, as outlined by its key concepts, is to ensure the secure and reliable operation of computer systems and data through the principles of Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, Accountability, Availability, and Non-repudiation. \n\nThese seven concepts collectively aim to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and systems, while also ensuring that legitimate users can access resources when needed and that actions can be traced back to responsible parties."
