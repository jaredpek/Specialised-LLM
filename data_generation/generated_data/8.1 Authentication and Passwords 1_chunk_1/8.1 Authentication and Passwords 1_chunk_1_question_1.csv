How many key concepts are there in the field of computer security?,There are 7 key concepts in the field of computer security.
What is Authentication in computer security?,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, and it is especially important in cyberspace."
How is Authentication typically solved or addressed?,"Authentication, which is the act of verifying someone's identity, is typically solved by mechanisms such as 2FA. 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) is a method used to address identity verification."
What is the definition of Authorization?,Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action.
How is Authorization implemented in computer security?,"Authorization, which is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, is solved by using an Access control list. An Access control list is a mechanism used to manage permissions."
What is the goal of Confidentiality?,The goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
How is Confidentiality achieved in computer security?,"Confidentiality, which aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, is solved by encryption. Encryption is a method used to secure contents."
Explain Data/message integrity.,"Data/message integrity refers to the state where, when parties like Alice and Bob exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages. This ensures the data remains unmodified."
How is Data/message integrity ensured?,"Data/message integrity, which ensures that the contents of messages remain unmodified by a third party, is solved by using a MAC (Message Authentication Code). A MAC is a code used to ensure messages are unmodified."
What is Accountability in computer security?,Accountability in computer security refers to determining who is responsible for actions taken within a system.
How is Accountability typically addressed?,"Accountability, which involves determining who is responsible for actions, is solved by maintaining a log trail. A log trail is a record of events used to identify who is responsible."
What does Availability mean in the context of computer security?,Availability in computer security refers to ensuring access to system resources and information.
How is Availability maintained in computer systems?,"Availability, which ensures access to system resources, is solved by adding redundancy. Redundancy is the act of adding duplicate components to ensure continued access."
Define Non-repudiation.,"Non-repudiation refers to undenialibility, meaning that a party cannot deny having sent a message or performed an action."
How is Non-repudiation achieved?,"Non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility of actions or messages, is solved by using digital signatures. Digital signatures are a cryptographic method used to ensure undenialibility."
Which of the computer security concepts are related to cryptography?,"The computer security concepts related to cryptography are Authentication, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, and Non-repudiation."

Why is Authentication important in cyberspace?,Authentication is especially important in cyberspace because it is the act of verifying someone's identity in a digital environment.
What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, while Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action."
"What does ""identity"" refer to in the context of Authentication?","In the context of Authentication, ""identity"" refers to the characteristic that is verified to confirm who someone is. Authentication is the act of verifying this identity."
What is the purpose of an Access control list in Authorization?,The purpose of an Access control list in Authorization is to solve the problem of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. An Access control list is a mechanism used to manage permissions.
What kind of contents does Confidentiality aim to keep secret?,Confidentiality aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
"What does ""unmodified"" mean in the context of Data/message integrity?","In the context of Data/message integrity, ""unmodified"" means that the original contents of a message or data have not been altered or tampered with by any unauthorized third party. Data/message integrity ensures that messages are unmodified."
"What is a ""log trail"" used for in computer security?",A log trail is used in computer security to solve the problem of Accountability by providing a record of events. Accountability refers to determining who is responsible for actions.
"How does ""adding redundancy"" contribute to Availability?","Adding redundancy contributes to Availability by duplicating critical components or functions of a system. Availability ensures access to system resources, and redundancy is the act of adding duplicate components to ensure this continued access."
"What is the significance of ""undenialibility"" in Non-repudiation?","The significance of ""undenialibility"" in Non-repudiation is that it ensures a party cannot falsely deny having sent a message or performed an action. Non-repudiation refers to this undenialibility."
"Which computer security concept deals with ""secrecy contents""?","Confidentiality deals with ""secrecy contents,"" aiming to keep the contents of communication or data secret. Confidentiality is the goal of keeping contents secret."
What is 2FA and how does it relate to computer security?,"2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) is a mechanism used to solve Authentication. Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, and 2FA is an example of how this identity verification is addressed."
What is a MAC (Message Authentication Code) used for?,"A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is used to solve Data/message integrity. Data/message integrity ensures that messages remain unmodified, and a MAC is a code used for this purpose."
What are digital signatures used for in computer security?,"Digital signatures are used to solve Non-repudiation. Non-repudiation ensures undenialibility, and digital signatures are a cryptographic method used to achieve this undenialibility."
What is the primary objective of computer security related to user permissions?,The primary objective of computer security related to user permissions is Authorization. Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action.
Which computer security concept ensures that data is not tampered with during transmission?,"Data/message integrity ensures that data is not tampered with during transmission, as it aims to prevent a third party from modifying the contents of messages, thereby keeping them unmodified."
What is the role of encryption in maintaining confidentiality?,"Encryption plays a crucial role in maintaining confidentiality by being the method used to solve it. Confidentiality aims to keep the contents of communication or data secret, and encryption is used to secure these contents."
"How does computer security address the question of ""who is responsible""?","Computer security addresses the question of ""who is responsible"" through Accountability. Accountability is solved by maintaining a log trail, which is a record of events used to identify who is responsible."
"What is the purpose of ensuring ""access"" in computer security?","The purpose of ensuring ""access"" in computer security is related to Availability. Availability aims to ensure that users can access system resources and information when needed, and access is what Availability provides."
Can a user deny an action if Non-repudiation is in place?,"No, if Non-repudiation is in place, a user cannot deny an action because Non-repudiation ensures undenialibility, typically solved by digital signatures."
What is the core principle behind Confidentiality?,The core principle behind Confidentiality is secrecy. Confidentiality is the goal of keeping the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
How does computer security ensure that messages are authentic and have not been altered?,Computer security ensures that messages are authentic and have not been altered through Data/message integrity. Data/message integrity is solved by using a MAC (Message Authentication Code) to ensure messages are unmodified.
What is the primary function of Authentication?,"The primary function of Authentication is to verify someone's identity, especially in cyberspace, to confirm that a user or entity is who they claim to be."
