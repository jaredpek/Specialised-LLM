Compare Authentication with Authorization in computer security.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, which is especially important in cyberspace. It is solved by mechanisms such as 2FA and cryptographic methods. In contrast, Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. It is solved by an Access Control List."
What are the key differences between Confidentiality and Data/message integrity?,"Confidentiality is the goal of keeping the secrecy contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. It is solved by encryption and cryptographic methods. Data/message integrity, on the other hand, is the principle that when parties exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages, ensuring the data remains unmodified. This is solved by Message Authentication Code (MAC) or message authentication code, and cryptographic methods."
How do Accountability and Availability differ in the context of computer security?,"Accountability is the concept of determining who is responsible for actions, and it is solved by a log trail. Availability, in contrast, is the concept of ensuring access to resources, and it is solved by adding redundancy."
Compare Non-repudiation with Authentication.,"Non-repudiation is the property of undeniability, meaning an action or communication cannot be denied by the sender or originator. It is solved by digital signatures and cryptographic methods. Authentication, conversely, is the act of verifying someone's identity, which is especially important in cyberspace. It is solved by mechanisms such as 2FA and cryptographic methods."
What distinguishes Authorization from Confidentiality?,"Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, and it is solved by an Access Control List. Confidentiality, however, is the goal of keeping the secrecy contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. It is solved by encryption and cryptographic methods."
