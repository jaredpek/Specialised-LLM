What are the 7 key concepts in the field of computer security?,The 7 key concepts in the field of computer security are:\n1. Authentication\n2. Authorization\n3. Confidentiality\n4. Data/message integrity\n5. Accountability\n6. Availability\n7. Non-repudiation
What is Authentication in computer security?,Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity. This process is especially important in cyberspace.
What is Authorization in computer security?,Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action.
What is Confidentiality in computer security?,The goal of confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
What is Data/message integrity?,"Data/message integrity refers to the state where, when parties like Alice and Bob exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages."
What is Accountability in the context of computer security?,Accountability is a key concept in computer security that addresses the question of 'who is responsible'.
What is Availability in computer security?,Availability is a key concept in computer security that pertains to ensuring access.
What is Non-repudiation in computer security?,Non-repudiation is a key concept in computer security that ensures undenialibility.
How is Authentication typically solved?,"Authentication, which is the act of verifying someone's identity, is typically solved by methods such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Cryptography is involved in this process."
How is Authorization implemented in computer security?,"Authorization, which is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, is typically solved by using an Access Control List."
How is Confidentiality achieved?,"Confidentiality, whose goal is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, is solved by encryption. Cryptography is involved in this process."
How is Data/message integrity ensured?,"Data/message integrity, which ensures that the contents of messages remain unmodified by a third party, is solved by using Message Authentication Codes (MAC-msg auth code). Cryptography is involved in this process."
How is Accountability solved in computer security?,"Accountability, which addresses the question of 'who is responsible', is solved by maintaining a log trail."
How is Availability ensured in computer systems?,"Availability, which pertains to ensuring access, is solved by adding redundancy."
How is Non-repudiation achieved?,"Non-repudiation, which ensures undenialibility, is solved by using digital signatures. Cryptography is involved in this process."
Why is Authentication important in cyberspace?,"Authentication, the act of verifying someone's identity, is especially important in cyberspace."
What is the primary goal of Confidentiality?,The primary goal of Confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
What does Data/message integrity aim to prevent?,Data/message integrity aims to prevent a third party from being able to modify the contents of messages exchanged between users.
What question does Accountability address in computer security?,Accountability in computer security addresses the fundamental question of 'who is responsible'.
What does Availability ensure in computer security?,Availability ensures that there is access to systems and resources.
What does Non-repudiation guarantee?,"Non-repudiation guarantees undenialibility, meaning that a party cannot falsely deny having performed a particular action or communication."
Which of the 7 key concepts in computer security involve cryptography?,The key concepts in computer security that involve cryptography are:\n1. Authentication\n2. Confidentiality\n3. Data/message integrity\n4. Non-repudiation
What is the core act involved in Authentication?,The core act involved in Authentication is verifying someone's identity.
What is the core act involved in Authorization?,The core act involved in Authorization is checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action.
What types of information does Confidentiality aim to protect?,"Confidentiality aims to protect the contents of a transient communication or data stored on temporary or persistent storage, keeping them secret."
What does 'unmodified' refer to in the context of Data/message integrity?,"In the context of Data/message integrity, 'unmodified' refers to the desired state where the contents of messages exchanged between parties remain exactly as sent, without any alteration by a third party."
What is the role of 2FA in computer security?,"Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an example of a method used to solve Authentication, which is the act of verifying someone's identity."
How do Access Control Lists contribute to computer security?,"Access Control Lists contribute to computer security by being the method used to solve Authorization, which is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action."
What is the role of encryption in achieving confidentiality?,Encryption plays a crucial role in achieving Confidentiality by being the method used to solve it. Confidentiality's goal is to keep the contents of communication or data secret.
How do Message Authentication Codes (MACs) ensure data integrity?,"Message Authentication Codes (MACs), specifically MAC-msg auth codes, ensure data integrity by being the method used to solve it. Data/message integrity aims to keep message contents unmodified by third parties."
What is the purpose of a log trail in computer security?,A log trail serves the purpose of solving Accountability in computer security. Accountability addresses the question of 'who is responsible'.
How does adding redundancy enhance computer system availability?,Adding redundancy enhances computer system availability by being the method used to solve it. Availability is the concept that ensures access.
What is the function of digital signatures in ensuring non-repudiation?,Digital signatures function as the method used to solve Non-repudiation. Non-repudiation ensures undenialibility of actions or communications.
What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, while Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action."
Which security concept focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of messages?,Data/message integrity is the security concept that focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of messages. It ensures that a third party cannot modify the contents of exchanged messages.
Which security concept is concerned with keeping information secret?,Confidentiality is the security concept concerned with keeping information secret. Its goal is to keep the contents of transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret.
What does 'identity' refer to in the context of Authentication?,"In the context of Authentication, 'identity' refers to the unique characteristics or credentials of an individual or entity that are verified during the authentication process."
What does 'permission' signify in Authorization?,"In Authorization, 'permission' signifies the specific rights or privileges granted to a user that allow them to conduct certain actions or access particular resources."
What does 'secrecy contents' imply for Confidentiality?,"'Secrecy contents' for Confidentiality implies that the actual information or data being communicated or stored must be protected from unauthorized disclosure, ensuring only authorized parties can access it."
What does 'who is responsible' mean for Accountability?,"For Accountability, 'who is responsible' means identifying the specific individual or entity accountable for actions or events within a system, which is typically tracked via a log trail."
What does 'access' refer to in the context of Availability?,"In the context of Availability, 'access' refers to the ability of authorized users to utilize information and resources when needed, which is solved by adding redundancy."
What does 'undenialibility' mean in Non-repudiation?,"'Undenialibility' in Non-repudiation means that a sender cannot deny having sent a message, and a receiver cannot deny having received a message. This is solved by digital signatures."
What are the main objectives of computer security?,"The main objectives of computer security are encapsulated by 7 key concepts: Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Data/message integrity, Accountability, Availability, and Non-repudiation."
