What mechanism is used to manage user permissions in Authorization?,"The mechanism used to manage user permissions in Authorization, which is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, is an Access control list."
Explain the concept of 'permission' within the context of Authorization.,"Within the context of Authorization, 'permission' refers to the rights or privileges a user has to conduct a specific action. Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has such permission."
What is the act of checking user permissions called in computer security?,The act of checking user permissions to conduct some action in computer security is called Authorization. This ensures that users only perform actions they are allowed to.
What role does an Access control list play in computer security?,"An Access control list plays a role in solving Authorization. Authorization is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action, and an Access control list helps manage these permissions."
Distinguish between Authentication and Authorization based on their primary functions.,"Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, especially important in cyberspace. Authorization, on the other hand, is the act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct some action. While Authentication confirms 'who you are,' Authorization determines 'what you can do.'"
Define Confidentiality in computer security.,The goal of Confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This ensures that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized parties.
What is the primary goal of Confidentiality?,The primary goal of Confidentiality is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret. This objective is crucial for protecting sensitive information.
How is Confidentiality typically achieved in computer security?,"Confidentiality, which aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, is typically achieved or 'solved' by encryption."
What does 'secrecy contents' refer to in the context of Confidentiality?,"In the context of Confidentiality, 'secrecy contents' refers to the information or data that needs to be kept secret. The goal of Confidentiality is to keep these contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret."
Does Confidentiality involve cryptographic methods?,"Yes, Confidentiality, which aims to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, involves cryptographic methods, as it is solved by encryption and is associated with 'crypto'."
What type of data does Confidentiality aim to protect?,Confidentiality aims to protect the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage. Its goal is to keep these contents secret.
Explain the role of encryption in achieving Confidentiality.,"Encryption plays a crucial role in achieving Confidentiality. Confidentiality's goal is to keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret, and this is solved by encryption."
Define Data/message integrity in computer security.,"Data/message integrity refers to the principle that when Alice and Bob exchange messages, they do not want a third party to be able to modify the contents of their messages. It ensures that data remains unaltered."
What is the primary concern addressed by Data/message integrity?,The primary concern addressed by Data/message integrity is preventing a third party from being able to modify the contents of messages exchanged between parties like Alice and Bob. It ensures that data remains unmodified.
How is Data/message integrity typically solved?,"Data/message integrity, which ensures that the contents of messages are not modified by a third party, is typically solved by a Message Authentication Code (MAC-msg auth code)."
What does 'unmodified' signify in the context of Data/message integrity?,"In the context of Data/message integrity, 'unmodified' signifies that the contents of messages exchanged between parties have not been altered or tampered with by any third party. Data/message integrity aims to keep data unmodified."
Does Data/message integrity involve cryptographic methods?,"Yes, Data/message integrity, which ensures that the contents of messages are unmodified, involves cryptographic methods, as it is solved by a Message Authentication Code (MAC-msg auth code) and is associated with 'crypto'."
What mechanism is used to ensure that messages remain unmodified?,"The mechanism used to ensure that messages remain unmodified, thereby achieving Data/message integrity, is a Message Authentication Code (MAC-msg auth code)."
Explain the role of a Message Authentication Code (MAC-msg auth code) in computer security.,"A Message Authentication Code (MAC-msg auth code) plays a role in solving Data/message integrity. Data/message integrity ensures that when parties exchange messages, a third party cannot modify the contents of those messages, and this is achieved using a MAC-msg auth code."
Define Accountability in computer security.,Accountability in computer security refers to identifying who is responsible for actions or events within a system. It establishes a clear trail of activities.
