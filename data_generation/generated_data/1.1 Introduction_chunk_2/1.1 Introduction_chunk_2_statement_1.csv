Explain the general principle of how system complexity relates to insecurity.,"The general principle is that system complexity leads to insecurity. As systems become more complex, the number and type of security requirements increase to provide a protected environment for data and their processing, making them potentially harder to secure comprehensively."
How does misconfiguration by system users contribute to insecurity?,"Misconfiguration by system users contributes to insecurity when security features are not used correctly. This can leave systems vulnerable even if robust security mechanisms are in place, as the incorrect setup bypasses their intended protection."
Why are developers' mistakes a human factor leading to insecurity?,"Developers' mistakes are a human factor leading to insecurity because developers are humans and can make errors. These errors can result in security features not being designed correctly or security components not being implemented correctly, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities in the system."
How does social engineering by external parties lead to insecurity?,"Social engineering by external parties leads to insecurity by manipulating an individual's trust for profit. This tactic exploits human psychology to trick people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, rather than relying on technical exploits."
"Before being sent to a US server, where was the stolen data initially moved within Target's network?",The stolen data was first quietly moved to an unspecified server on Target's network before it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked.
