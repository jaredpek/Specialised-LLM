Therefore, the SingHealth breach impacted a significantly larger number of individuals."
What were the primary types of personal data stolen in the Singtel data breach versus the SingHealth data breach?,"In the Singtel data breach, personal data stolen included names, addresses, phone numbers, identification numbers (NRIC details), and dates of birth, in varying combinations. Additionally, bank account details of 28 former Singtel employees and credit card details of 45 employees of a corporate customer were stolen. In contrast, the SingHealth data breach involved the personal particulars of 1.5 million patients, with 160,000 of these, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and a few ministers, also having their outpatient prescriptions stolen.\n\n**NRIC (National Registration Identity Card)**: A mandatory identity document issued to citizens and permanent residents of Singapore."
Compare the attack vectors used in the Singtel data breach and the SingHealth cyber attack.,"The Singtel data breach occurred due to hackers extracting data during the breach of a third-party file sharing system used by the telco.

What are the differences between Trojan.POSRAM and BlackPOS malware as described in the Target attack case study?,"Trojan.POSRAM is a type of malware that collected unencrypted payment card information just after it was swiped at Target and while it sat in a POS terminal's memory. The code of Trojan.POSRAM bears a strong resemblance to BlackPOS, which is another type of POS malware. However, the Target malware, which contained Trojan.POSRAM, included a new attack method that evades forensic detection and conceals data transfers, making it hard to detect, distinguishing it from BlackPOS.\n\n**POS malware**: Malicious software designed to target Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, typically to steal payment card data.\n**RAM scraper**: A type of malware that scans the memory (RAM) of a computer for sensitive data, such as unencrypted credit card numbers, before they are encrypted or processed."
Compare the initial data movement within Target's network with its subsequent transmission to external servers.,"The data collected by the malware was first quietly moved to another server on Target's network. Subsequently, it was transmitted in chunks to a U.S.-based server that the attackers had hijacked, before ultimately being sent to a server in Russia."
What are the differences in how data was collected by the malware in the Target attack versus how it was stored before exfiltration?,"The malware collected 11GB of data from Target's POS terminals. Specifically, the Trojan.POSRAM malware collected unencrypted payment card information just after it was swiped at Target and while it sat in a POS terminal's memory. The collected data was then quietly moved around on Target's network before being sent to external servers.\n\n**POS terminal**: A device used to process card payments at retail locations.\n**RAM (Random Access Memory)**: A type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, used for temporary storage of data that the computer is actively using."
