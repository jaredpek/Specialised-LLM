What does cyber warfare entail?,Cyber warfare entails disrupting military operations or launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against government services or critical infrastructure.
Explain what supply chain attacks are in computer security.,"Supply chain attacks are a type of computer security threat where attackers target software or hardware suppliers to compromise the systems used by government or defense agencies. By compromising a supplier, attackers can indirectly gain access to their ultimate targets."
What is cyber terrorism?,"Cyber terrorism involves launching attacks aimed at causing physical destruction or instilling fear. Examples include targeting critical infrastructure such as dams, chemical plants, or hospitals."
What was the primary target of the Stuxnet worm?,"The Stuxnet worm was the first worm specifically designed to target control systems found in industrial plants. Its primary target was the motors controlling centrifuges in Iran's nuclear program, aiming to disrupt the creation of uranium fuel pellets."
What was the suspected impact of the Stuxnet worm on Iran's nuclear program?,"The Stuxnet worm is suspected to be partly responsible for delays in Iran's nuclear program. Analysis by security firm Symantec indicated that a Stuxnet-infected controller in an industrial plant would cause connected devices to run at very high speeds almost indefinitely, thereby disrupting processes like uranium enrichment."
Where were most Stuxnet infections found?,Figures gathered by security firms show that 60% of all infections caused by Stuxnet were on machines located in Iran.
What type of malware is Stuxnet?,"Stuxnet is classified as a worm, which is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself to spread to other computers. It was notable for being the first worm to target industrial control systems."
How is Flame spyware classified in terms of malware types?,"Flame spyware is classified as a sophisticated attack toolkit that functions as both a backdoor (Trojan) and can propagate itself through a local network like a computer worm. A backdoor, or Trojan, is a malicious program that gains unauthorized access to a computer system, while a worm is a self-replicating malware that spreads across networks."
What is suspected about the origin of the Flame spyware?,"The Flame spying software is suspected to be a cyber espionage attempt from a nation state, with possible ties to malware targeting Iran."
What are the general capabilities of the Flame spyware?,"Flame spyware is capable of sniffing network traffic, taking screenshots, recording audio conversations, logging keystrokes, gathering information about discoverable Bluetooth devices nearby, and turning the infected computer into a discoverable Bluetooth device. It also allows attackers to upload additional modules for further functionality."
Describe the modular nature of Flame spyware.,"Flame spyware is highly modular, allowing attackers to upload additional modules to extend its functionality. Researchers have discovered about 20 such modules. The entire package of modules is nearly 20 megabytes in size, contains over 3,000 lines of code, and includes libraries for compression, database manipulation, multiple methods of encryption, and batch scripting."
How does Flame spyware propagate itself?,"Flame spyware can propagate itself through a local network, similar to how a computer worm spreads. Kaspersky Lab suspects it may utilize a critical Windows vulnerability for this propagation, though this has not been confirmed."
How does system complexity relate to insecurity?,"System complexity leads to insecurity because as systems become more complex, the number of security requirements needed to provide a protected environment for data and their processing increases. For instance, a simple standalone monoprogram computer only needs physical security, while a networked computer requires physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection."
What security measure is required for a standalone computer running a single-user monoprogram?,"For a standalone computer running a single-user monoprogram, the primary security measure required is physical security."
What security measures are necessary for a standalone computer running a single-user multiprogram?,"For a standalone computer running a single-user multiprogram, two key security measures are necessary: physical security and process protection. Process protection ensures that multiple programs running concurrently do not interfere with each other's data or operations."
List the security requirements for a standalone computer used by multiple users.,"A standalone computer used by multiple users requires physical security, process protection, data protection, and user authentication. Data protection safeguards information from unauthorized access or modification, while user authentication verifies the identity of users accessing the system."
What are the comprehensive security requirements for a networked computer?,"For a networked computer, the comprehensive security requirements include physical security, process protection, data protection, user authentication, and communication protection. Communication protection is crucial for networked systems to secure data transmitted over the network."
How do system users contribute to insecurity?,"System users contribute to insecurity through misconfiguration, which means security features are not used correctly. Additionally, users often prioritize convenience and may disable security configurations that they find inconvenient, thereby weakening the system's defenses."
In what ways do system developers introduce insecurity?,"System developers introduce insecurity when security features are not designed correctly or when security components are not implemented correctly. Furthermore, developers are human and, like all humans, can make mistakes during the design and implementation process, leading to vulnerabilities."
How can external parties lead to insecurity?,"External parties can lead to insecurity when an individual's trust is manipulated for profit. A common method for this is social engineering, where individuals are tricked into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security."
