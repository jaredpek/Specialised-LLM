Analyze the timeline of the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database.,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database occurred from 26 June to 4 July 2018. This activity was stopped on 4 July 2018, when staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries and implemented measures to prevent similar occurrences."
What actions were taken to prevent further unauthorized access to the SingHealth Network after malware detection?,"Following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended implementing internet surfing separation. This measure was put in place on 20 July 2018 to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds in the network. No further signs of malicious activity were detected after this implementation."
Explain the security vulnerability related to network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database.,"A security vulnerability existed due to open network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database. This connection was deemed unnecessary and was maintained for administrative convenience, thereby increasing the attack surface area. A basic security review of the network architecture and connectivity could have identified this vulnerability, but no such review was conducted."
What was the primary reason the attacker could run queries on the SCM database unchallenged?,"The attacker was able to run queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries, unchallenged from 26 June to 4 July 2018 due to a lack of monitoring at the SCM database. Specifically, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries and no controls in place to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications."
What type of monitoring solution could have addressed the gaps in SCM database security?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) solutions, which are available on the market, could have addressed some or all of the identified gaps in monitoring the SCM database for unusual queries and access. However, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
Describe the security lapse concerning the SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in granting the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing the SGH Citrix servers, and logins were possible through other means without two-factor authentication. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of and utilized this alternative route for convenience."
What is the significance of the SGH Citrix servers' compromise in relation to the SCM database?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with access to the SCM database. This indicates a significant security lapse in the protection of the SGH Citrix servers, which served as a gateway to sensitive data."

What is the meaning of 'attack surface area' in the context of network security?,"In the context of network security, the 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all possible points (the 'attack vectors') where an unauthorized user (an 'attacker') can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing the attack surface area means minimizing these potential entry points."
Why was the open connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database considered a security vulnerability?,"The open network connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database created a security vulnerability because it provided an unnecessary pathway for potential attackers. This connection, maintained for administrative convenience, increased the overall attack surface area."
Was a security review conducted for the network architecture between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,"No, a basic security review of the network architecture and connectivity between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was not carried out."
What is the key takeaway regarding unnecessary connections?,The key takeaway is to get rid of unnecessary connections to reduce the attack surface area and enhance security.
What type of queries did the attacker run on the SCM database?,"The attacker ran queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries."
What controls were missing to detect bulk queries on the SCM database?,There were no existing controls in place to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database.
What controls were missing to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications?,There were no controls in place at the time of the attack to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications.
What is 'DAM' in the context of database security?,"DAM stands for Database Activity Monitoring. These are solutions available on the market that can monitor and log database activities, helping to detect unusual or malicious queries and access."
Was DAM implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack?,"No, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was the critical factor that gave the attacker access to the SCM database?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
