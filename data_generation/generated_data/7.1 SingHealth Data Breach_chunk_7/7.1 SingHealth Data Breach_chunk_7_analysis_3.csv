Analyze the security of SGH Citrix servers against unauthorized access.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in granting the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing the SGH Citrix servers, and logins by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and used it for convenience."
How did the compromise of SGH Citrix servers impact access to the SCM database?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What was the issue with Privileged Access Management for accessing SGH Citrix servers?,Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. Logins to the servers by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible.
Were IHiS Citrix administrators aware of alternative login routes to the SGH Citrix servers?,"Yes, IHiS Citrix administrators were not only aware of the alternative route for logging into the SGH Citrix servers but also made use of it for convenience."
What security measure was bypassed by alternative login methods to SGH Citrix servers?,The security measure bypassed by alternative login methods to SGH Citrix servers was 2-factor authentication.

What is 'database activity monitoring' (DAM)?,"Database activity monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions available on the market designed to monitor database activities, which could help address gaps in detecting unusual queries and access."
What was the state of security for SGH Citrix servers regarding access?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. This was because Privileged Access Management was not the sole method of access, and logins without 2-factor authentication were possible through alternative routes."
What does '2-factor authentication' mean in the context of server access?,"In the context of server access, '2-factor authentication' is a security process that requires two distinct forms of identification to grant access, making it more secure than single-factor authentication."
How did IHiS Citrix administrators contribute to the security lapse?,"IHiS Citrix administrators contributed to the security lapse by being aware of and utilizing an alternative, less secure route for logging into the SGH Citrix servers for convenience, bypassing the intended security measures."
