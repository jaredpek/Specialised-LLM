What is the SGH Citrix server?,"The SGH Citrix server is a server that was compromised, providing the attacker with access to the SCM database. It was not adequately secured against unauthorized access."
What is the attack surface area in cybersecurity?,The attack surface area in cybersecurity refers to the sum of all the points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Keeping network connections open for convenience can increase this area.
What is a security vulnerability?,A security vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. An open network connection between servers can create such a vulnerability.
What are bulk queries in the context of a database?,"Bulk queries, in the context of a database, refer to a large number of queries executed in a single operation or in rapid succession. The lack of controls to detect these was a contributing factor to the cyber attack."
What are illegitimate applications in the context of database access?,"Illegitimate applications, in the context of database access, are programs or tools that are not authorized or intended for interacting with the database. The absence of controls to detect queries made using such applications was a security gap."
What is database activity monitoring (DAM)?,"Database activity monitoring (DAM) is a type of solution that monitors and audits database activities. These solutions can help detect unusual queries and unauthorized access, addressing gaps in database security."
"What does it mean for SGH Citrix servers to be ""not adequately secured""?",It means that the security measures in place for the SGH Citrix servers were insufficient to prevent unauthorized access. This included issues with privileged access management and the possibility of logins without 2-factor authentication.
What is Privileged Access Management (PAM)?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cybersecurity strategy that controls, monitors, and secures all human and non-human privileged identities and their access to critical assets. It was not the exclusive means of access for the SGH Citrix servers."
What is 2-factor authentication?,2-factor authentication is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. This is used to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password. Logins to the SGH Citrix servers were possible without it.
What was the consequence of the compromise of SGH Citrix servers?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
Why was the open connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database considered a problem?,"The open connection was considered a problem because it was not necessary, served only for convenience in administering the database, and significantly increased the attack surface area, creating a security vulnerability."
What was the role of IHiS Citrix administrators in the security lapse?,"IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of an alternative, less secure route to access the SGH Citrix servers (without 2-factor authentication) and used it for convenience, contributing to the security lapse."
Compare the period of unusual queries to the SCM database with the implementation of internet surfing separation.,"The period of unusual queries to the SCM database, including copying and exfiltration of data, was from 26 June to 4 July 2018. Internet surfing separation, a measure to prevent further attacker activity, was implemented on 20 July 2018."
What are the differences between a lack of monitoring and the absence of specific controls for database queries?,"A lack of monitoring at the SCM database meant that unusual queries, including bulk queries, went unnoticed. The absence of specific controls refers to the lack of mechanisms to detect bulk queries or queries made using illegitimate applications. Both contributed to the attacker's success."
Compare the security of SGH Citrix servers with the monitoring of the SCM database.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured, allowing unauthorized access and providing a pathway to the SCM database. The SCM database itself suffered from a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access, with no existing controls to detect bulk queries or those made with illegitimate applications."
What are the differences between the discovery of malware and the discovery of unusual queries?,The discovery of malware on the S.P. server led to a recommendation for internet surfing separation by CSA. The discovery of unusual queries to the SCM database by IHiS staff led to the stopping of data copying and exfiltration and steps to prevent future similar queries.
Compare the purpose of internet surfing separation with the purpose of database activity monitoring (DAM).,"Internet surfing separation was implemented to prevent an attacker from exercising command and control over network footholds after malware detection. Database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions are designed to monitor and audit database activities, addressing gaps in detecting unusual queries and unauthorized access to databases."
What are the differences between the security measures recommended by CSA and the security measures that were not implemented by IHiS?,"CSA recommended internet surfing separation, which was implemented on 20 July 2018. IHiS did not implement database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions, which could have addressed gaps in monitoring unusual queries and access to the SCM database."
Compare the convenience factor for administrators with the security implications for the SGH Citrix servers and SCM database.,"For the SGH Citrix servers, administrators used an alternative route without 2-factor authentication for convenience, compromising security. Similarly, an open connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was maintained for convenience in administering the database, which increased the attack surface area and created a security vulnerability."
What are the differences between the actions taken by IHiS staff and the actions of the attacker regarding the SCM database?,"IHiS staff discovered unusual queries and stopped the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database, taking steps to prevent future similar queries. The attacker, conversely, ran queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries, and copied and exfiltrated data during the period from 26 June to 4 July 2018."
Explain the role of the SGH Citrix servers in the cyber attack.,"The SGH Citrix servers played a critical role in the cyber attack because their compromise provided the attacker with access to the SCM database. This compromise was facilitated by inadequate security measures, including the possibility of logins without 2-factor authentication."
What is the significance of the period from 18 to 19 July 2018?,"The period from 18 to 19 July 2018 was when attempts were made to re-enter the SingHealth Network. Following this, CSA recommended internet surfing separation."
"What is the difference between an ""unusual query"" and a ""bulk query"" in the context of the SCM database?","An ""unusual query"" is a query that deviates from normal patterns and was discovered by IHiS staff, leading to the stopping of data exfiltration. A ""bulk query"" is a large number of queries executed together, and there were no existing controls to detect these specific types of queries on the SCM database."
Compare the security posture of the SGH Citrix servers before and after the implementation of internet surfing separation.,"Before the implementation of internet surfing separation, the SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured, allowing unauthorized access and contributing to the breach. Internet surfing separation, implemented on 20 July 2018, was a measure to prevent further attacker activity and command and control, implying an improvement in the network's defense against re-entry."
