"Were IHiS Citrix administrators aware of the alternative route for server access, and what did they do?","Yes, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of the alternative route for server access. They made use of it for convenience."
Compare the period of queries to the SCM database with the period of the cyber attack.,"The period of queries to the SCM database was from 26 June to 4 July 2018. The cyber attack also occurred during this timeframe, as the copying and exfiltration of data was stopped on 4 July 2018."
What are the differences between the actions taken by IHiS staff and the recommendations made by CSA?,IHiS staff discovered unusual queries to the SCM database and took steps to prevent similar queries. CSA recommended internet surfing separation to prevent an attacker from exercising command and control over network footholds after malware detection.
What are the differences between the security measures in place for SGH Citrix servers and the ideal security practices?,"For SGH Citrix servers, Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means of access, and logins without 2-factor authentication were possible, which administrators used for convenience. Ideally, access should be exclusively through Privileged Access Management with mandatory 2-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the attack surface."
What are the differences between the monitoring of the SCM database during the attack and the capabilities of DAM solutions?,"During the attack, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries or block queries made using illegitimate applications on the SCM database. Database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions, however, are available on the market and can address such monitoring gaps."
What are the differences between the network connection between SGH Citrix servers and SCM database and a secure network configuration?,"The network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was an open connection, not necessary and used for convenience, which increased the attack surface area and created a security vulnerability. A secure network configuration would involve eliminating unnecessary connections and conducting security reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities."
What is the significance of the S.P. server in the context of the cyber attack?,"The S.P. server was significant because malware was detected on it, and communications from it were observed. This led CSA to recommend internet surfing separation to prevent further attacker control."
What does 'attack surface area' refer to in the context of network connections?,"In the context of network connections, 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all the points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. An open and unnecessary connection increases this area."
What is '2-factor authentication' and why is it important for server access?,"2-factor authentication is a security process that requires two distinct forms of identification to grant access to a computer or other resource. It is important for server access because it adds an extra layer of security, making it much harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if they have one form of credential."
What is 'Privileged Access Management' and how was it insufficient in securing SGH Citrix servers?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cybersecurity strategy that controls, monitors, and secures all human and non-human access to critical digital assets. It was insufficient for securing SGH Citrix servers because it was not the exclusive means of access, allowing logins through other means without 2-factor authentication."
What are 'bulk queries' in the context of database activity?,"Bulk queries, in the context of database activity, refer to a large number of database queries executed in a single operation or in rapid succession. The document mentions that the attacker ran 'bulk queries' on the SCM database."
What is the role of IHiS in the events described?,"IHiS staff discovered the unusual queries to the SCM database and took steps to stop the copying and exfiltration of data. IHiS was also responsible for implementing or not implementing certain security measures, such as DAM and ensuring proper access controls for Citrix servers."
What is the role of CSA in the events described?,CSA (Cyber Security Agency) made a recommendation after detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server. They recommended implementing internet surfing separation to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control.
What is the significance of the date 4 July 2018?,"4 July 2018 is significant because it was the date when the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped, after staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries."
What is the significance of the dates 18 and 19 July 2018?,The dates 18 and 19 July 2018 are significant as they mark the period when attempts were made to re-enter the SingHealth Network.
What is the significance of the date 20 July 2018?,20 July 2018 is significant because it was the date when internet surfing separation was implemented.
What were the 'unusual queries' mentioned in the document?,"The document mentions 'unusual queries' that were discovered by staff from IHiS, leading to the stopping of data copying and exfiltration from the SCM database. These queries were part of the attacker's activity from 26 June to 4 July 2018 and included 'bulk queries'."
What does 'command and control' refer to in the context of a cyber attack?,'Command and control' in the context of a cyber attack refers to the ability of an attacker to remotely direct and manage compromised systems or malware within a network. CSA recommended internet surfing separation to prevent the attacker from exercising this control.
"What are 'footholds' in a network, in the context of a cyber attack?","'Footholds' in a network, in the context of a cyber attack, refer to any compromised systems or access points that an attacker has established, allowing them to maintain a presence and potentially expand their access within the network."
What is the difference between 'copying' and 'exfiltration' of data?,"'Copying' of data refers to creating duplicates of information. 'Exfiltration' of data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network to an external location. In this context, the attacker was both copying and removing data from the SCM database."
What is the purpose of 'internet surfing separation'?,The purpose of 'internet surfing separation' is to prevent an attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds in the network. It was recommended after the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server.
What is the implication of 'no further signs of malicious activity were detected thereafter'?,"This statement implies that after the implementation of internet surfing separation on 20 July 2018, the cyber threat was neutralized, and the attackers were no longer able to carry out malicious activities within the SingHealth Network."
What is the 'SingHealth Network' in the context of the document?,"The 'SingHealth Network' refers to the computer network infrastructure belonging to SingHealth, which was the target of cyber attacks and attempts to re-enter. The SCM database and SGH Citrix servers are part of this network."
What is the 'SCM database' and its role in the cyber attack?,"The SCM database is a database that was queried, copied, and exfiltrated by an attacker. It was the primary target of the data breach, and its compromise was facilitated by vulnerabilities in network connections and lack of monitoring."
What are 'SGH Citrix servers' and their role in the cyber attack?,"SGH Citrix servers are servers within the SingHealth network that were compromised. Their compromise was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database, as they were not adequately secured against unauthorized access."
What is the meaning of 'unauthorized access' in relation to the SGH Citrix servers?,"'Unauthorized access' in relation to the SGH Citrix servers means that individuals or entities gained access to these servers without proper permission or authentication. This was possible because the servers were not adequately secured, and alternative access routes without 2-factor authentication were used."
What is the relationship between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,The SGH Citrix servers served as a gateway or point of access to the SCM database. The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in enabling the attacker to gain access to the SCM database.
What is the significance of 'convenience' as a reason for security lapses?,"Convenience is presented as a reason why security lapses occurred, specifically in the case of SGH Citrix servers. Administrators used an alternative, less secure access route for convenience, highlighting a trade-off between security and ease of use that can lead to vulnerabilities."
What is the primary lesson learned from the 'CONTRIBUTING FACTORS LEADING TO THE CYBER ATTACK' section?,"The primary lesson is that inadequate security measures, such as unnecessary network connections, lack of monitoring, and insufficient access controls, contribute significantly to successful cyber attacks. The document emphasizes the need to address these factors to prevent future breaches."
What is the difference between a 'security vulnerability' and a 'security measure'?,"A 'security vulnerability' is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker. An 'open network connection' creating a security vulnerability is an example. A 'security measure' is a control put in place to protect against threats, such as implementing 2-factor authentication or database activity monitoring."
What is the implication of 'no such review was carried out' regarding network connections?,"The implication is that a missed opportunity existed to identify and rectify a critical security vulnerability. A review could have revealed the risks associated with the open network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database, allowing for preventative action before the attack."
What is the core problem identified with the monitoring of the SCM database?,"The core problem was the lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access. Specifically, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries or to detect/block queries made using illegitimate applications."
What is the difference between detecting and blocking queries?,Detecting queries means identifying that a query is being made. Blocking queries means preventing a query from being executed. The lack of controls meant that neither detection nor prevention was effectively happening for illegitimate queries to the SCM database.
