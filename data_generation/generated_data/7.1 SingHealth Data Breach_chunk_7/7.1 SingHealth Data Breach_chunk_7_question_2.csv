Why was the attacker able to run queries on the SCM database unchallenged?,The attacker was able to run queries on the SCM database unchallenged because of a lack of monitoring at the SCM database.
What controls were missing to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database?,There were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database.
What controls were missing to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications?,There were no controls in place at the time of the attack to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications.
What type of solutions could address the gaps in monitoring at the SCM database?,"Database activity monitoring (""DAM"") solutions available on the market could address some or all of the gaps highlighted."
Was Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack?,"No, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was a critical issue regarding the SGH Citrix servers?,The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access.
How did the compromise of SGH Citrix servers impact the attack?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What was the issue with Privileged Access Management for accessing SGH Citrix servers?,Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. Logins to the servers by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible.
What did IHiS Citrix administrators know about alternative access routes to the servers?,IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of the alternative route for accessing the servers without 2-factor authentication.
How did IHiS Citrix administrators use the alternative access route?,IHiS Citrix administrators made use of the alternative route for convenience.
What is the definition of 'exfiltration' in the context of data?,"Exfiltration, in the context of data, refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system."
What is meant by 'unusual queries' in the context of a database?,"Unusual queries in a database context refer to database requests that deviate from normal patterns, potentially indicating malicious activity or misuse."
What is the role of IHiS in the context of the document?,IHiS is an entity whose staff discovered unusual queries to the SCM database and was responsible for implementing internet surfing separation and managing Citrix servers.
What is the SCM database?,"The SCM database is a system from which data was copied and exfiltrated, and to which unusual queries were made."
What is the significance of '2-factor authentication' in securing access?,"2-factor authentication is a security measure that requires two different forms of identification to grant access to a system, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain entry."
What is an 'attack surface area' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, the attack surface area refers to the sum of all the points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment."
What is 'malware'?,"Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems."
What is 'command and control' in the context of network security?,"Command and control (C2) refers to the communication between an attacker's infrastructure and the compromised systems within a victim's network, allowing the attacker to issue commands and receive data."
What is a 'foothold' in a computer network?,"A 'foothold' in a computer network refers to a point of entry or a compromised system that an attacker has gained access to, which can then be used to launch further attacks or maintain persistence."
What is the function of a 'server' in a network?,"A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network."
What is the purpose of 'internet surfing separation'?,Internet surfing separation is a security measure implemented to prevent attackers from using internet access points within a network to control compromised systems.
What does CSA stand for in the context of the document?,CSA is an entity that recommended internet surfing separation after detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server. The full name is not provided.
What is the definition of 'compromise' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, a compromise refers to a security breach where an unauthorized party gains access to sensitive information or systems."
What is 'unauthorized access'?,"Unauthorized access is the act of gaining entry to a system, network, or data without proper permission or authorization."
What is the definition of 'privileged access'?,"Privileged access refers to the elevated permissions granted to users or systems that allow them to perform sensitive operations, such as system administration or accessing critical data."
What is the role of 'Citrix servers' in this context?,"SGH Citrix servers were involved in the cyber attack, and their security against unauthorized access was found to be inadequate, leading to the attacker gaining access to the SCM database."
What is 'database activity monitoring' (DAM)?,"Database activity monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions that track and audit database activities, which can help detect unusual or malicious queries and access patterns."
What is the difference between 'copying' and 'exfiltration' of data?,"Copying data refers to making a duplicate of it, while exfiltration specifically refers to the unauthorized transfer or removal of data from a system."
What is the implication of 'network connections being allowed' for database administration?,"Allowing network connections for database administration, while convenient, can increase the attack surface area and create security vulnerabilities if not properly managed."
What is the meaning of 'illegitimate applications' in the context of database queries?,"Illegitimate applications, in this context, refer to software or tools used to access the database that are not authorized or are used in a way that bypasses normal security controls."
