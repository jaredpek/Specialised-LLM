Who discovered the unusual queries to the SCM database and what actions were taken?,Staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries to the SCM database. They took steps to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database.
What happened on 18 and 19 July 2018 regarding the SingHealth Network?,"On 18 and 19 July 2018, there were attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network. This followed the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server."
What recommendation did CSA make after detecting malware and what was the purpose of this recommendation?,"After detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented. The purpose of this recommendation was to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds in the network."
When was internet surfing separation implemented in the SingHealth Network?,Internet surfing separation was implemented on 20 July 2018.
Were there any further signs of malicious activity after internet surfing separation was implemented?,"No, no further signs of malicious activity were detected after internet surfing separation was implemented."
What were the contributing factors leading to the cyber attack?,"The document highlights contributing factors leading to the cyber attack, including network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database being allowed, lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access, and SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured against unauthorized access."
Describe the network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database.,"Network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed. This open connection was not necessary and was primarily for convenience to administer the database. A basic security review could have identified this as a security vulnerability, but no such review was carried out."
What is the 'attack surface area' in the context of network connections?,"The 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of the different points (the ""attack vectors"") where an unauthorized user (an ""attacker"") can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing the attack surface area means minimizing these potential entry points."
What was the consequence of the open network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,The open network connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database created a security vulnerability.
What was the moral derived from the issue of unnecessary network connections?,The moral derived from the issue of unnecessary network connections is: GET RID OF UNNECESSARY CONNECTIONS!
What was the situation regarding monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access?,"There was a lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access. From 26 June to 4 July 2018, an attacker ran queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries, unchallenged due to this lack of monitoring."
What specific controls were missing for detecting queries to the SCM database?,"There were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database. Additionally, there were no controls in place at the time of the attack to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications."
What is Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) and its relevance to the SCM database issue?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions available on the market that can monitor database activities. These solutions could address some or all of the gaps in detecting unusual queries and access. However, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
How were the SGH Citrix servers secured against unauthorized access?,The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What was the issue with Privileged Access Management for the SGH Citrix servers?,Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. Logins to the servers by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible.
What did IHiS Citrix administrators do regarding the alternative access route to the SGH Citrix servers?,IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of the alternative route for accessing the SGH Citrix servers (without 2-factor authentication) and made use of it for convenience.
What is the significance of the compromise of SGH Citrix servers?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What is 2-factor authentication?,2-factor authentication is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. This is typically a combination of something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a security token or a code from a mobile device).
What period did the queries to the SCM database occur?,The queries to the SCM database occurred from 26 June to 4 July 2018.
What was the role of IHiS in the SCM database incident?,Staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries to the SCM database and took steps to stop the copying and exfiltration of data. IHiS was also responsible for the implementation of internet surfing separation and the use of DAM solutions.
What is CSA and what was its recommendation?,CSA is an entity that recommended internet surfing separation. This recommendation was made after the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server.
What is an S.P. server?,"An S.P. server is a server from which malware and communications were detected, leading to recommendations for internet surfing separation."
What is the definition of malware?,"Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Its detection on the S.P. server prompted security recommendations."
What does 'command and control' mean in the context of network security?,"In network security, 'command and control' refers to the ability of an attacker to issue commands to compromised systems and receive information back from them. Internet surfing separation was recommended to prevent the attacker from exercising this control."
What are 'footholds' in a network?,"'Footholds' in a network refer to any compromised systems or access points that an attacker has established, allowing them to maintain a presence and potentially move further into the network."
What is the 'SingHealth Network'?,The SingHealth Network is the computer network belonging to SingHealth. Attempts were made to re-enter this network on 18 and 19 July 2018.
What does 'malicious activity' refer to in this context?,"'Malicious activity' refers to actions taken by an attacker to compromise systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. No further signs of such activity were detected after internet surfing separation."
What is the significance of 'unusual queries' to a database?,"'Unusual queries' to a database are requests that deviate from normal patterns of usage. Their discovery can indicate potential misuse or a security breach, as was the case with the SCM database."
What is 'data exfiltration'?,Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network. This was occurring from the SCM database and was stopped on 4 July 2018.
What is a 'security vulnerability'?,A security vulnerability is a weakness in a system or network that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. The open network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database represented such a vulnerability.
What is 'network architecture'?,"Network architecture refers to the design and structure of a computer network, including how different components are connected and how data flows between them. A review of the network architecture could have identified security vulnerabilities."
What is 'connectivity' in a network context?,Connectivity in a network context refers to the ability of different devices or systems to communicate with each other. The connectivity between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was examined for security implications.
What is the definition of 'unauthorized access'?,"Unauthorized access is the ability to access a system, network, or data without proper permission or authentication. The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against this."
What is 'privileged access'?,"Privileged access refers to the ability to perform actions with elevated permissions on a system, often required for administrative tasks. The document mentions that Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing SGH Citrix servers."
What is the role of 'logins' in server access?,"Logins are the process by which users authenticate themselves to gain access to a server. The document notes that logins to SGH Citrix servers were possible through means other than the intended Privileged Access Management, and without 2-factor authentication."
What is the purpose of 'security review'?,A security review is an examination of a system or network to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. A basic security review of the network architecture could have revealed the risks associated with the open connection to the SCM database.
What is the definition of 'illegitimate applications' in the context of database queries?,'Illegitimate applications' in this context refers to software or tools that are not authorized or approved for interacting with the SCM database. The lack of controls to detect queries from such applications was a contributing factor to the breach.
What is the difference between 'monitoring' and 'controls' in database security?,"Monitoring involves observing database activity to detect suspicious patterns, while controls are implemented measures designed to prevent or block unauthorized actions. The SCM database lacked both effective monitoring for unusual queries and controls to block illegitimate access."
What does it mean for a connection to be 'open' in a network?,"An 'open' connection in a network means that there is a direct communication path established between two systems, allowing data to flow freely. In this case, the open connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was a security concern."
What is the significance of 'convenience' in the context of IT administration?,"Convenience in IT administration refers to making tasks easier or faster for administrators, often by bypassing stricter security protocols. The document notes that IHiS Citrix administrators used an alternative access route for convenience."
What is the definition of 'compromise' in cybersecurity?,"In cybersecurity, a 'compromise' means that a system or network has been breached, and its security has been violated, often leading to unauthorized access or data loss. The compromise of SGH Citrix servers was critical to the attack."
What is the role of 'staff' in discovering security issues?,"Staff play a crucial role in identifying and reporting security issues. In this case, staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries to the SCM database, initiating the response to the breach."
What is the purpose of stopping data exfiltration?,"The purpose of stopping data exfiltration is to prevent sensitive or confidential information from being stolen or leaked from a system or network, thereby protecting data privacy and security."
What is the implication of 'unchallenged' queries on a database?,"When database queries are 'unchallenged,' it means they are not being detected or flagged as suspicious by security systems. This allowed the attacker to continue their activities on the SCM database without interruption."
What is the definition of 'preventive measures' in cybersecurity?,Preventive measures are actions taken to stop security incidents from happening in the first place. Steps taken to prevent similar queries from being run against the SCM database are an example of preventive measures.
What is the relationship between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,SGH Citrix servers had network connections to the SCM database. The compromise of these servers was critical in providing the attacker access to the SCM database.
What is the meaning of 'thereafter' in the context of security events?,"'Thereafter' means after a particular event or time. In this context, 'no further signs of malicious activity were detected thereafter' means that after the implementation of internet surfing separation, no more malicious activity was observed."
What is the definition of 'unusual queries' in the context of database access?,'Unusual queries' refer to database requests that deviate from normal operational patterns. Their detection by IHiS staff was a key indicator of the cyber breach involving the SCM database.
What is the significance of the date 4 July 2018 in relation to the SCM database breach?,"The date 4 July 2018 is significant because it was the day the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped, following the discovery of unusual queries by IHiS staff."
