"What is a contributing factor leading to the cyber attack, as indicated by the document?",One contributing factor leading to the cyber attack was that network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed.
Why was the open connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database considered problematic?,The open connection was not necessary and was primarily for convenience to administer the database. It increased the attack surface area and created a security vulnerability.
What could a basic security review have revealed about the network connections?,A basic security review of the network architecture and connectivity between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database could have shown that the open network connection created a security vulnerability.
Was a security review of the network connections carried out?,"No, such a review was not carried out."
What is the moral derived from the issue of unnecessary network connections?,The moral is to get rid of unnecessary connections.
What was a significant issue related to the SCM database concerning unusual queries and access?,There was a lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access.
What was the consequence of the lack of monitoring at the SCM database?,"The attacker was able to run queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries, unchallenged."
What specific controls were missing to detect bulk queries on the SCM database?,There were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database.
What other type of queries could not be detected or blocked due to a lack of controls?,There were no controls in place to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications.
What type of solutions could address the gaps in monitoring at the SCM database?,"Database activity monitoring (""DAM"") solutions available on the market could address some or all of the highlighted gaps."
Was Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack?,"No, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was a major security issue with the SGH Citrix servers?,The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access.
How did the compromise of SGH Citrix servers impact the cyber attack?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
What was a vulnerability related to accessing the SGH Citrix servers?,"Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers, and logins to the servers by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible."
What did IHiS Citrix administrators know about the alternative route for server access?,IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route.
How did IHiS Citrix administrators utilize the alternative route for server access?,They made use of it for convenience.
What is the SCM database?,"The SCM database is a system that stores data and can be queried. During the period of 26 June to 4 July 2018, it experienced unauthorized copying and exfiltration of data due to unusual queries."
What is exfiltration of data?,"Exfiltration of data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network. In this context, it means data was copied and removed from the SCM database without permission."
What are unusual queries in the context of a database?,"Unusual queries are database requests that deviate from normal patterns of usage. These could be queries that are excessively large, frequent, or complex, potentially indicating malicious activity."
What is IHiS?,"IHiS refers to the Integrated Health Information Systems, a group whose staff discovered unusual queries to the SCM database and took steps to prevent further unauthorized access."
What is the SingHealth Network?,The SingHealth Network is a system that was targeted by attempts to re-enter it on 18 and 19 July 2018. It is related to the S.P. server and cybersecurity measures like internet surfing separation.
What is malware?,"Malware, short for malicious software, is software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. Its detection on the S.P. server led to recommendations for enhanced security measures."
What is a S.P. server?,A S.P. server is a server within the SingHealth Network from which malware was detected and communications were observed. This detection prompted cybersecurity recommendations.
What is CSA?,"CSA is an organization that made recommendations for cybersecurity measures, specifically internet surfing separation, after detecting malware on the S.P. server."
What is command and control in the context of a cyber attack?,Command and control refers to the ability of an attacker to direct and manage compromised systems or footholds within a network. Internet surfing separation aims to prevent this.
What are footholds in a network?,Footholds are points of entry or compromised systems within a network that an attacker can use to maintain access and potentially expand their control. Internet surfing separation helps to eliminate these.
What are SGH Citrix servers?,"SGH Citrix servers are servers within the SingHealth network that were connected to the SCM database. Their security against unauthorized access was found to be inadequate, and they played a critical role in granting the attacker access to the SCM database."
What is the attack surface area?,"The attack surface area refers to the sum of all possible points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing this area, by eliminating unnecessary connections, is a security best practice."
What is a security vulnerability?,A security vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. An open network connection between servers can create such a vulnerability.
What are bulk queries?,Bulk queries are database queries that involve a large volume of data or operations. The inability to detect these was a significant gap in the monitoring of the SCM database.
What are illegitimate applications in the context of database queries?,Illegitimate applications are software or tools used to access or interact with a database in a way that is not authorized or intended. The lack of controls to detect queries from such applications was a security lapse.
What is Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions designed to monitor and audit database activities. These solutions can help detect unusual queries, unauthorized access, and other security threats."
What is unauthorized access?,"Unauthorized access is gaining entry to a system or data without proper permission. The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against this, which was critical for the attacker to reach the SCM database."
What is Privileged Access Management (PAM)?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cybersecurity strategy that controls, monitors, and secures all human and non-human access to critical information and resources. It was not the sole method for accessing SGH Citrix servers."
What is 2-factor authentication?,2-factor authentication is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. Its absence for logins to SGH Citrix servers by alternative means was a security weakness.
What is the significance of the period from 26 June to 4 July 2018 regarding the SCM database?,"This period marks the timeframe during which an attacker queried the SCM database, including performing data copying and exfiltration, which was eventually stopped on 4 July 2018."
What was the role of IHiS staff in the SCM database incident?,IHiS staff discovered the unusual queries to the SCM database and took steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
What security measure was recommended by CSA to prevent attackers from controlling compromised systems?,CSA recommended the implementation of internet surfing separation to prevent attackers from exercising command and control over remaining footholds in the network.
What was the consequence of the open network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,The open network connection created a security vulnerability that allowed the attacker to gain access to the SCM database.
What was the reason for the attacker being able to run queries on the SCM database unchallenged?,"The attacker was able to run queries unchallenged due to a lack of monitoring at the SCM database, specifically the absence of controls to detect bulk queries or queries from illegitimate applications."
