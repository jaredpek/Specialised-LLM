Was DAM implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack?,"No, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was the security status of SGH Citrix servers regarding unauthorized access?,SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access.
What was the significance of the compromise of the SGH Citrix servers?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
Was Privileged Access Management the only method for accessing SGH Citrix servers?,"No, Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers."
What alternative method of logging into SGH Citrix servers was possible without 2-factor authentication?,Logins to the servers by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible.
Were IHiS Citrix administrators aware of the alternative route for server access?,"Yes, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route."
Why did IHiS Citrix administrators use the alternative route for server access?,IHiS Citrix administrators made use of the alternative route for convenience.
Define 'exfiltration' in the context of data security.,Exfiltration refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network.
What does 'IHiS' stand for in the context of the document?,"The document does not explicitly state what 'IHiS' stands for, but it refers to staff from IHiS who discovered unusual queries."
What is a 'cyber attack'?,A cyber attack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization.
Explain the term 'malware'.,"Malware is a type of software that is intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network by any means. It is also known as malicious software."
What is 'command and control' in the context of network security?,Command and control (C2) refers to the infrastructure and methods used by attackers to communicate with and control compromised systems or devices within a network.
What is a 'foothold' in network security?,A 'foothold' in network security refers to a compromised system or access point within a network that an attacker can use to maintain persistence and potentially expand their access.
Define 'internet surfing separation'.,"Internet surfing separation is a security measure implemented to isolate internet browsing activities from critical systems or networks, thereby preventing potential malware infections or unauthorized access."
What is meant by 'attack surface area' in cybersecurity?,"The 'attack surface area' in cybersecurity refers to the sum of all the different points (the ""attack vectors"") at which an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment."
What is a 'security vulnerability'?,"A security vulnerability is a weakness in an information system that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or cause other damage."
What is a 'query' in the context of a database?,A query is a request for information from a database. It is a command that allows users to retrieve specific data based on certain criteria.
What are 'bulk queries'?,"Bulk queries are database queries that involve a large number of operations or data requests, often executed in a single batch."
What is 'illegitimate application' in the context of database access?,"An 'illegitimate application' in the context of database access refers to a program or software that is not authorized or approved for interacting with the database, potentially posing a security risk."
Define 'database activity monitoring' (DAM).,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) is a security solution that monitors and records database activities, providing visibility into who is accessing what data, when, and from where. It helps detect and prevent threats like unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and policy violations."
What is 'unauthorized access'?,"Unauthorized access is the act of gaining entry to a system, network, or data without proper permission or authorization."
What is 'Privileged Access Management' (PAM)?,"Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cybersecurity strategy that controls, monitors, and secures all human and non-human access to critical information and infrastructure. It focuses on managing accounts with elevated privileges."
Explain '2-factor authentication'.,2-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a code from a mobile device) or something the user is (like a fingerprint).
What is the role of SGH Citrix servers in the cyber attack?,"The SGH Citrix servers played a critical role as they were compromised, which gave the attacker access to the SCM database."
