What controls were missing to detect or block illegitimate queries to the SCM database?,There were no controls in place at the time of the attack to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications.
What type of solutions could address the gaps in monitoring at the SCM database?,"Database activity monitoring (""DAM"") solutions available on the market could address some or all of the highlighted gaps."
Was DAM implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack?,"No, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What was the security status of SGH Citrix servers against unauthorized access?,SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access.
What was the significance of the compromise of SGH Citrix servers?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database.
Was Privileged Access Management the only way to access SGH Citrix servers?,"No, Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers."
What alternative method of logging into SGH Citrix servers was possible?,Logins to the servers by other means without 2-factor authentication were possible.
Were IHiS Citrix administrators aware of the alternative route for server access?,"Yes, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route."
Why did IHiS Citrix administrators use the alternative route for server access?,IHiS Citrix administrators made use of the alternative route for convenience.
Define 'exfiltration of data'.,Exfiltration of data refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a system or network.
Define 'IHiS'.,"IHiS refers to Integrated Health Information Systems, an organization involved in the cyber breach."
Define 'SCM database'.,The SCM database is a database that was the target of queries and data exfiltration during the cyber breach.
Define 'malware'.,"Malware is a type of software that is intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network by any means."
Define 'CSA'.,"CSA refers to the Cyber Security Agency, which made recommendations regarding network security."
Define 'internet surfing separation'.,"Internet surfing separation is a security measure implemented to prevent users or attackers from accessing the internet, thereby limiting potential communication channels."
Define 'S.P. server'.,The S.P. server is a server within the network from which malware and communications were detected.
Define 'attack surface area'.,The attack surface area refers to the sum of all the points (the 'attack vectors') at which an unauthorized user (an 'attacker') can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing the attack surface area is a security principle aimed at minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
Define 'security vulnerability'.,A security vulnerability is a weakness in an information system that could be exploited by a threat actor.
Define 'bulk queries'.,"Bulk queries, in the context of a database, refer to a large number of database queries executed in a single operation or in rapid succession, which can be unusual and potentially indicative of malicious activity."
Define 'illegitimate applications'.,"Illegitimate applications, in this context, refer to software or tools that are not authorized or are used for malicious purposes to interact with the database."
Define 'database activity monitoring (DAM)'.,Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) is a security solution that monitors and records database activity in real-time to detect and alert on suspicious or unauthorized access and operations.
Define 'unauthorized access'.,"Unauthorized access refers to the act of gaining entry to a system, network, or data without proper permission or authorization."
Define 'SGH Citrix servers'.,"SGH Citrix servers are servers within the SingHealth (SGH) network that utilize Citrix technology, and their security was compromised."
Define 'Privileged Access Management'.,Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a cybersecurity strategy that controls and monitors access to critical information systems and sensitive data by users with elevated permissions.
Define '2-factor authentication'.,2-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires two different authentication factors to verify a user's identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a security token or a code from a mobile device).
What was the primary issue with the network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,"The primary issue was that these network connections were allowed and were not necessary, serving only for convenience in administering the database. This created a security vulnerability by increasing the attack surface area, and no review was conducted to identify this."
What was the consequence of the lack of monitoring at the SCM database?,"The consequence of the lack of monitoring was that an attacker was able to run queries, including bulk queries, on the SCM database unchallenged between 26 June and 4 July 2018. This was due to the absence of controls to detect bulk queries or queries made using illegitimate applications."
How did the SGH Citrix servers contribute to the attacker gaining access to the SCM database?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Specifically, Privileged Access Management was not the sole method of access, and logins were possible without 2-factor authentication. This alternative route, known and used by administrators for convenience, was exploited by the attacker."
What actions were taken to stop the data exfiltration from the SCM database?,The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were stopped on 4 July 2018 after staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries and implemented measures to prevent similar future occurrences.
What was the recommendation made by CSA regarding the S.P. server and network security?,"Following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended the implementation of internet surfing separation. This measure was intended to prevent the attacker from maintaining command and control over any remaining footholds within the network."
Describe the security gaps related to the SCM database monitoring.,"The security gaps included the absence of existing controls to detect bulk queries made to the SCM database and the lack of controls to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications. Consequently, an attacker could run such queries unchallenged."
