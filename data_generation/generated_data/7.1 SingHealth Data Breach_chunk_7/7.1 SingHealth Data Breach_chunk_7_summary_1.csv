Summarize the events related to attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network on 18 and 19 July 2018.,"On 18 and 19 July 2018, there were attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network. Following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) recommended implementing internet surfing separation. This measure was intended to prevent the attacker from establishing command and control over any remaining footholds within the network. Internet surfing separation was put into effect on 20 July 2018, and subsequently, no further signs of malicious activity were observed."
Can you summarize the contributing factors leading to the cyber attack?,"The provided document outlines contributing factors that led to the cyber attack. These factors include network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database being allowed, a lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access, and SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured against unauthorized access."
Explain the issue with network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database.,"Network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed, which was not a necessary connection and was primarily for convenience in administering the database. This open connection created a security vulnerability by increasing the attack surface area. A basic security review of the network architecture and connectivity could have identified this vulnerability, but no such review was conducted. The moral takeaway is to eliminate unnecessary connections."
Describe the lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access.,"From 26 June to 4 July 2018, an attacker was able to run queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries, without challenge due to a lack of monitoring. Specifically, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database, nor were there controls in place to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications. While database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions exist that could address these gaps, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
Detail the security issues with SGH Citrix servers regarding unauthorized access.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, which was critical in allowing the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing these servers; logins were possible through other means without two-factor authentication. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and utilized it for convenience."
What actions were taken to stop the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database?,The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped on 4 July 2018. This was a result of staff from IHiS discovering unusual queries and subsequently taking steps to prevent similar queries from being run against the SCM database.
