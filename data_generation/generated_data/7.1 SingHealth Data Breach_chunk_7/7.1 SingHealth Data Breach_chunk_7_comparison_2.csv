Compare the security of SGH Citrix servers with the SCM database.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, and their compromise was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database. The SCM database itself suffered from a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access, with no existing controls to detect bulk queries or queries made using illegitimate applications. Furthermore, network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed, which was considered an unnecessary open connection that created a security vulnerability."
What are the differences between Privileged Access Management and other means of accessing SGH Citrix servers?,Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive method for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. Logins to the servers were also possible through other means that did not require 2-factor authentication. This alternative route was known and used by IHiS Citrix administrators for convenience.
Explain the security vulnerability related to the SCM database.,"The SCM database had a lack of monitoring for unusual queries and access. Specifically, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the database, nor were there controls in place to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications. Additionally, an open network connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database, which was not necessary and existed for administrative convenience, created a security vulnerability. This open connection was not identified or addressed through a basic security review."
What role did the SGH Citrix servers play in the cyber attack?,The SGH Citrix servers played a critical role in the cyber attack because they were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. Their compromise provided the attacker with access to the SCM database.
Describe the timeline of events related to the SCM database queries and the subsequent actions.,"From 26 June to 4 July 2018, an attacker ran queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries. This activity was stopped on 4 July 2018, after staff from IHiS discovered the unusual queries and took steps to prevent similar queries in the future. The attacker was able to perform these actions unchallenged due to a lack of monitoring at the SCM database."
"What is the significance of the ""MORAL: GET RID OF UNNECESSARY CONNECTIONS!"" statement?","This statement emphasizes the importance of minimizing the attack surface area by eliminating any network connections that are not essential. In the context of the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database, the open connection was deemed unnecessary for administration and created a security vulnerability that should have been removed."
What is Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) and why was its absence a problem?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions available on the market that can monitor database activity. These solutions could have addressed some or all of the identified gaps in monitoring at the SCM database, such as detecting unusual or bulk queries and queries made using illegitimate applications. The absence of DAM by IHiS at the time of the attack meant these monitoring capabilities were not in place, allowing the attacker to operate unchallenged."
Compare the recommendation by CSA with the actual implementation date of internet surfing separation.,CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over remaining footholds in the network. This recommendation was made after the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server. Internet surfing separation was subsequently implemented on 20 July 2018.
What were the security implications of allowing network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,"Allowing network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database created a security vulnerability. This open connection was not necessary and was primarily for convenience in administering the database. A basic security review could have identified this vulnerability, but no such review was conducted."
What were the specific deficiencies in monitoring at the SCM database that contributed to the cyber attack?,"The specific deficiencies in monitoring at the SCM database were: 1. There were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database. 2. There were no controls in place at the time of the attack to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications. These deficiencies allowed the attacker to run queries, including bulk queries, unchallenged."
Explain the concept of 'attack surface area' in relation to the SCM database.,"The 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all possible points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. In the context of the SCM database, the open network connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database increased the attack surface area. The statement 'we shud reduce attack surface area' implies that this connection was an unnecessary entry point that made the system more vulnerable to attack."
