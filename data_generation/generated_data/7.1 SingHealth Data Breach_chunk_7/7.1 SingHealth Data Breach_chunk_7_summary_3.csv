"Provide a comprehensive summary of the SCM database queries from June 26 to July 4, 2018.","From June 26 to July 4, 2018, there were queries made to the SCM database, which involved the copying and exfiltration of data. This activity was discovered by staff from IHiS, who then took steps to stop the copying and exfiltration on July 4, 2018. They also implemented measures to prevent similar queries from being run against the SCM database in the future. The attacker was able to run these queries, including bulk queries, unchallenged due to a lack of monitoring at the SCM database. Specifically, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries and no controls in place to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications."
Summarize the actions taken to stop the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database.,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were stopped on July 4, 2018. This action was initiated after staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries. Following this discovery, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database."
Explain the role of IHiS in the SCM database incident.,"IHiS staff played a crucial role in addressing the SCM database incident. They discovered the unusual queries that led to the copying and exfiltration of data. Upon discovery, they took immediate action to stop the data exfiltration on July 4, 2018, and implemented measures to prevent future occurrences of similar queries against the SCM database."
What were the key issues with monitoring at the SCM database during the period of the attack?,"During the period of the attack, from June 26 to July 4, 2018, there was a significant lack of monitoring at the SCM database. This deficiency allowed the attacker to run queries, including bulk queries, unchallenged. Specifically, there were no existing controls in place to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database. Furthermore, there were no controls to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications. The absence of database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions, which could have addressed these gaps, was also a contributing factor, as DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
"Describe the nature of the queries made to the SCM database between June 26 and July 4, 2018.","Between June 26 and July 4, 2018, queries were made to the SCM database that involved the copying and exfiltration of data. These queries included 'bulk queries,' which are a large volume of data requests. The attacker was able to execute these queries without challenge due to inadequate monitoring and the absence of specific controls designed to detect or block such activities."
What security measures were recommended after malware was detected on the S.P. server?,"After the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation should be implemented. The purpose of this recommendation was to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds they might have had within the network."
When was internet surfing separation implemented in response to the detected malware?,"Internet surfing separation was implemented on July 20, 2018. This measure was put in place following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, and as a recommendation from CSA to prevent further attacker control within the network."
Were there any further signs of malicious activity after the implementation of internet surfing separation?,"No, there were no further signs of malicious activity detected after the implementation of internet surfing separation on July 20, 2018."
What was a contributing factor to the cyber attack related to network connections?,A significant contributing factor to the cyber attack was that network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed. This open connection was not necessary and was maintained for the convenience of administering the database. This unnecessarily increased the attack surface area.
Explain the security vulnerability created by the open network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database.,The open network connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database created a security vulnerability. A basic security review of the network architecture and connectivity would have revealed that this open connection was not necessary and increased the attack surface area. This vulnerability could have been identified and addressed if such a review had been conducted.
Was a security review conducted for the network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,"No, a security review of the network architecture and connectivity between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was not carried out. This lack of review meant that the security vulnerability created by the open network connection was not identified or addressed."
What is the key takeaway regarding unnecessary connections in the context of the cyber attack?,"The key takeaway regarding unnecessary connections, in the context of the cyber attack, is to 'GET RID OF UNNECESSARY CONNECTIONS!' This highlights the importance of minimizing the attack surface area by eliminating any network connections that are not essential for operational purposes."
How were the SGH Citrix servers secured against unauthorized access?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. The compromise of these servers was critical in providing the attacker with access to the SCM database. Specifically, Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. Logins to the servers by other means, without 2-factor authentication, were possible. This alternative route was known to IHiS Citrix administrators and was used by them for convenience."
What was the issue with Privileged Access Management for the SGH Citrix servers?,Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive means for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. This meant that logins to the servers were possible through other methods that did not require 2-factor authentication. This lack of exclusive reliance on PAM created a security gap that could be exploited.
Were administrators aware of alternative access routes to the SGH Citrix servers?,"Yes, IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of the alternative routes for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. They not only knew about these routes but also utilized them for convenience, which contributed to the inadequate security of the servers."
How did the compromise of SGH Citrix servers impact the cyber attack?,"The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical in enabling the attacker to gain access to the SCM database. Because the servers were not adequately secured and alternative access methods without 2-factor authentication were possible and used, the attacker could exploit these weaknesses to reach the SCM database."
What is 'bulk queries' in the context of the SCM database incident?,"'Bulk queries' refers to a large volume of queries made to the SCM database. During the incident, the attacker made such queries, which were part of the data copying and exfiltration activities. The lack of monitoring and controls meant these bulk queries went undetected."
What is 'exfiltration of data' in the context of the SCM database incident?,"'Exfiltration of data' refers to the unauthorized copying and removal of data from the SCM database. This was a key activity undertaken by the attacker between June 26 and July 4, 2018, and was eventually stopped by IHiS staff."
What is 'attack surface area' in the context of network security?,"In the context of network security, the 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all the points or areas where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Maintaining open and unnecessary network connections increases this attack surface area, making the system more vulnerable."
What is '2-factor authentication'?,'2-factor authentication' is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a security token or a code from a mobile device). It is a stronger security measure than single-factor authentication.
What is 'Privileged Access Management' (PAM)?,"'Privileged Access Management' (PAM) is a cybersecurity strategy that controls, monitors, and secures all human and non-human privileged identities and their access to critical assets. In the context of the SGH Citrix servers, PAM was intended to be the primary method for secure access, but it was not exclusively enforced."
What is 'database activity monitoring' (DAM)?,"'Database Activity Monitoring' (DAM) refers to solutions that monitor and audit database activities. These solutions can help detect suspicious or unauthorized access and queries, such as bulk queries or those made using illegitimate applications. DAM solutions could have addressed gaps in monitoring the SCM database but were not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What were the dates of the SCM database queries and the subsequent stopping of data exfiltration?,"The queries to the SCM database, which involved the copying and exfiltration of data, occurred from June 26 to July 4, 2018. The copying and exfiltration of data were stopped on July 4, 2018."

This measure was recommended by CSA after malware was detected on the S.P. server.
What was the consequence of the open network connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database?,"The consequence of the open network connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was the creation of a security vulnerability. This connection, maintained for administrative convenience, unnecessarily increased the attack surface area, making the system more susceptible to unauthorized access and data exfiltration."
What steps were taken to prevent similar queries to the SCM database after the incident?,"After the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were stopped, steps were taken to prevent any similar queries from being run against the SCM database in the future. The specific nature of these steps is not detailed, but they were implemented by IHiS staff."
What was the primary reason the attacker could run queries unchallenged on the SCM database?,"The primary reason the attacker could run queries unchallenged on the SCM database was a lack of monitoring. There were no existing controls to detect bulk queries, nor were there controls to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications. This absence of monitoring allowed the data exfiltration to occur undetected for a period."
What types of queries did the attacker make to the SCM database?,"The attacker made queries to the SCM database that included the copying and exfiltration of data. Specifically, these queries included 'bulk queries,' indicating a large volume of data requests."
What is the significance of the SGH Citrix servers in the context of the cyber attack?,"The SGH Citrix servers were significant because their compromise was critical in giving the attacker access to the SCM database. The servers were not adequately secured, allowing unauthorized access through methods other than the intended Privileged Access Management, which lacked 2-factor authentication."
How did the lack of exclusive Privileged Access Management contribute to the security breach?,"The lack of exclusive Privileged Access Management meant that other means of logging into the SGH Citrix servers were possible without 2-factor authentication. This provided an alternative, less secure route for attackers to gain access, which was exploited to compromise the servers and subsequently access the SCM database."
What was the timeframe of the cyber attack on the SCM database?,"The cyber attack, involving queries to the SCM database for copying and exfiltration of data, occurred from June 26 to July 4, 2018."
"What was the outcome of the attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network on July 18 and 19, 2018?","Following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, CSA recommended internet surfing separation. This was implemented on July 20, 2018. After this implementation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected, suggesting the attempts to re-enter the network were thwarted."
What is the 'SingHealth Cyber Breach'?,"The 'SingHealth Cyber Breach' refers to the incident involving unauthorized access and exfiltration of data from the SCM database between June 26 and July 4, 2018. It also encompasses subsequent attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network and the contributing factors that led to these security compromises."
What were the contributing factors leading to the cyber attack?,"The contributing factors leading to the cyber attack included: 1. Network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed, creating an unnecessary open connection and increasing the attack surface area, without a prior security review. 2. There was a lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access, with no existing controls to detect bulk queries or queries made using illegitimate applications. 3. The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, as Privileged Access Management was not exclusive, and logins without 2-factor authentication were possible and utilized for convenience."
Summarize the security issues related to the SGH Citrix servers.,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access. A key issue was that Privileged Access Management was not the exclusive method for access; logins were possible through other means without 2-factor authentication. This alternative route was known and used by IHiS Citrix administrators for convenience, creating a significant security vulnerability that allowed the attacker access to the SCM database."
What is the implication of 'we shud reduce attack surface area' in the context of the SCM database connections?,"The statement 'we shud reduce attack surface area' implies that the open connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was unnecessary and increased the system's vulnerability. Reducing the attack surface area means minimizing the points of entry or potential weaknesses that an attacker could exploit. Therefore, eliminating such unnecessary connections is a crucial security practice."
What was the impact of the lack of controls to detect illegitimate application queries on the SCM database?,The lack of controls in place to detect or block any queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications meant that the attacker could use such methods to access and exfiltrate data without being detected. This contributed to the unchallenged nature of the queries during the incident.
What is the 'SCM database'?,"The 'SCM database' is a database that was targeted in a cyber attack between June 26 and July 4, 2018. Data was copied and exfiltrated from this database. It was accessed via SGH Citrix servers, which were not adequately secured."

Following the detection of malware on the S.P. server, CSA recommended the implementation of internet surfing separation to enhance the security of the SingHealth Network."
What is the 'moral' derived from the issue of unnecessary network connections?,"The moral derived from the issue of unnecessary network connections is to 'GET RID OF UNNECESSARY CONNECTIONS!' This emphasizes the critical importance of simplifying network architecture and removing any connections that do not serve a vital purpose, thereby reducing the potential attack surface area and enhancing security."
What was the critical factor that allowed the attacker access to the SCM database?,"The critical factor that allowed the attacker access to the SCM database was the compromise of the SGH Citrix servers. These servers were not adequately secured, and the attacker was able to exploit weaknesses in their access controls, including the possibility of logging in without 2-factor authentication."
What was the convenience factor exploited by administrators regarding SGH Citrix servers?,"IHiS Citrix administrators exploited the convenience of an alternative route for accessing the SGH Citrix servers. This route allowed logins without 2-factor authentication, bypassing the more secure Privileged Access Management system. This convenience-driven practice contributed to the servers' inadequate security."
"What is the significance of the date July 4, 2018, in the SCM database incident?","July 4, 2018, is significant because it was the date when the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database were stopped. This action was taken by staff from IHiS after they discovered unusual queries."
"What is the significance of the dates June 26 to July 4, 2018?","The period from June 26 to July 4, 2018, marks the timeframe during which the attacker ran queries on the SCM database, including the copying and exfiltration of data. This period ended with the stopping of the data exfiltration on July 4, 2018."
