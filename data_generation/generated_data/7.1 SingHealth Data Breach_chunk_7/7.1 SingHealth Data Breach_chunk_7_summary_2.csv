Provide a comprehensive summary of the queries to the SCM database from 26 June to 4 July 2018.,"From 26 June to 4 July 2018, there were queries made to the SCM database. The copying and exfiltration of data from this database was halted on 4 July 2018. This action was taken after staff from IHiS identified unusual queries and implemented measures to prevent similar queries from being executed against the SCM database in the future."
Summarize the events related to attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network on 18 and 19 July 2018.,"On 18 and 19 July 2018, there were attempts to re-enter the SingHealth Network. Following the detection of malware and communications from the S.P. server, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) recommended implementing internet surfing separation. This measure was intended to prevent the attacker from establishing command and control over any remaining footholds within the network. Internet surfing separation was put into effect on 20 July 2018, and no further signs of malicious activity were observed thereafter."
Can you summarize the contributing factors leading to the cyber attack?,"The provided document highlights several contributing factors that led to the cyber attack. These include network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database being allowed, a lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access, and SGH Citrix servers not being adequately secured against unauthorized access."
Explain the issue with network connections between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database.,"Network connections between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database were allowed, which was not necessary and was primarily for convenience in administering the database. This open connection created a security vulnerability by increasing the attack surface area. A basic security review of the network architecture and connectivity could have identified this vulnerability, but no such review was conducted. The moral of this issue is to eliminate unnecessary connections."
Describe the lack of monitoring at the SCM database for unusual queries and access.,"From 26 June to 4 July 2018, an attacker ran queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries, without challenge due to a lack of monitoring. Specifically, there were no existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to the SCM database, nor were there controls in place to detect or block queries made using illegitimate applications. While database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions exist that could address these gaps, DAM was not implemented by IHiS at the time of the attack."
What were the security issues with SGH Citrix servers regarding unauthorized access?,"The SGH Citrix servers were not adequately secured against unauthorized access, which was critical in allowing the attacker access to the SCM database. Privileged Access Management was not the sole method for accessing these servers; logins were possible through other means without 2-factor authentication. IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this alternative route and utilized it for convenience."
Detail the timeline of the SCM database breach and its resolution.,"The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database occurred between 26 June and 4 July 2018. On 4 July 2018, staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries and took steps to stop the data copying and exfiltration. They also implemented measures to prevent similar queries from being run against the SCM database in the future."
Explain the recommendation made by CSA regarding the SingHealth Network after malware detection.,"After detecting malware and communications from the S.P. server, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) recommended that internet surfing separation be implemented. The purpose of this recommendation was to prevent the attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds within the SingHealth Network."
When was internet surfing separation implemented in the SingHealth Network?,Internet surfing separation was implemented on 20 July 2018.
What was the outcome after implementing internet surfing separation?,"After the implementation of internet surfing separation, no further signs of malicious activity were detected."
What is meant by 'attack surface area' in the context of network security?,"In the context of network security, the 'attack surface area' refers to the sum of all the points (the 'surface') where an unauthorized user (an 'attacker') can try to enter or extract data from an environment. Reducing the attack surface area means minimizing the number of potential entry points and vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit."
Why was the open connection between SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database a security vulnerability?,"The open connection between the SGH Citrix servers and the SCM database was a security vulnerability because it increased the attack surface area. This open connection, while convenient for database administration, provided an unnecessary pathway that an attacker could potentially exploit to gain access to the SCM database."
What is Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)?,"Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) refers to solutions available on the market designed to monitor and audit database activities. These solutions can help detect unusual queries, unauthorized access, and other potentially malicious actions performed on a database, thereby addressing security gaps."
Why was the compromise of SGH Citrix servers critical to the cyber attack?,The compromise of the SGH Citrix servers was critical because it provided the attacker with the necessary access to the SCM database. This indicates that the security of the Citrix servers was a key gateway for the attacker to reach the targeted data.
What is 2-factor authentication and why was its absence a security concern?,"2-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two different authentication factors to verify their identity. This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a code from a mobile app or a physical token). The absence of 2-factor authentication for logging into the SGH Citrix servers meant that logins could be achieved with just one factor (e.g., a password), making it easier for unauthorized individuals to gain access."
Describe the role of IHiS Citrix administrators in the security lapse.,"IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of an alternative, less secure route for accessing the SGH Citrix servers (one that did not require 2-factor authentication). They not only knew about this route but also used it for convenience, thereby contributing to the security lapse and the ease with which the attacker could gain unauthorized access."
What actions were taken by IHiS staff to stop the data exfiltration?,"Staff from IHiS discovered unusual queries on 4 July 2018, which led them to stop the copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database. They also took steps to prevent similar queries from being run against the SCM database in the future."
What was the timeframe during which the attacker ran queries on the SCM database?,The attacker ran queries on the SCM database from 26 June to 4 July 2018.
What types of queries did the attacker run on the SCM database?,"The attacker ran queries on the SCM database, including bulk queries."
What was the primary reason the attacker could run queries on the SCM database unchallenged?,The attacker was able to run queries on the SCM database unchallenged because of a lack of monitoring at the SCM database.

Who recommended internet surfing separation?,The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) recommended internet surfing separation.
What is the significance of 'footholds' in a network context?,"In a network context, 'footholds' refer to any points of access or control that an attacker has established within a network. These can be exploited to maintain presence, move laterally, or launch further attacks."
